it is a good thing. but why must we destroy the earth and 2/3rds of humanity to accomplish it? that is the downside to the end of the age saga which is coming. you can liken it to when god poured out the plagues on egypt because pharaoh refused to free his people. that event will be repeated again, only on a world wide basis. and it will be in response to antichrists actions against his people.	"what is this ""we"" stuff? got a mouse in your pocket? i thought god was going to destroy it...not ""we"".   "	sarc
"the planned parenthood motto is ""every child a wanted child.'"	if that's truly what the organization says, then it's a hypocrite of an organization.	notsarc
the only difference is that the evolutionists are correct. btw, they've found the crater which was made by the asteroid. the mass extinction is a fact and so is evolution.	your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood.	notsarc
how can a christian not be? picking an choosing what one likes out of the bible doesn't mean they know god.	most christians are, as is frequently pointed out by numerous posters in many different threads on this board.	notsarc
you sure can. a mass murder of at least 13 children was committed with a knife. that has happened before even in japan as well as other countries including here. no conclusion to be drawn. it happened, it is history and now a well known fact.	you don't even take into consideration the possibility that japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the us- if guns were freely available in that country. you have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you're trying to peddle. 	notsarc
"brooklyn, new york (vbs.tv) -- on january 22, 2006, the new york times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called ""the most dangerous place in the world."" a week before that, the cia fired missiles remotely from a predator aircraft into the waziristan tribal area. they were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al qaeda operatives. instead, they killed 18 women and children.one week before that, i arrived in pakistan to visit darra adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns.gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. it took months of pre-planning with the consul general of pakistan in montreal and top officials in peshawar. they repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the pakistani army had too many ""sensitive operations"" going on in that region. without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the northwest frontier province), we never would have gotten in.the government assigned me and my team a political agent named naeem afridi. he was born and raised in the tribal areas. he took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. you can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like naeem.our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the frontier agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with aks and sidearms. they became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. most of the work is done by hand.the vendors are pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. they comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the soviets out of afghanistan in the late '80s.these days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the taliban. they purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the u.s. army in afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the pakistani army.this summer, i went back to pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. the pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the taliban and al qaeda. the u.s. and british troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in afghanistan. meanwhile, pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations.but at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. the whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government.for pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time."	"so...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting america's ""weak gun control laws"" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?it seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to america, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons. they've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want."	notsarc
a loophole has been identified and a bill has been introduced to close it?	'two other sacramento-area police officers also were implicated in illegal weapons sales but not charged because they didn't turn large profits,' ah it's ok to sell illegal weapons as long as you don't make a big profit?  'california law bars citizens from buying handguns that have not been deemed safe by the state department of justice, but the law exempts peace officers.' the cops there are above the law? had to put a new hard drive and install,good to be back.	notsarc
wouldn't it be nice if you didn't overuse the word oppress. if you really believe that gays are oppressed then believe me you ain't seen nothing in the world as yet. try looking at some countries in the world and you will see what oppression really means.	i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?	sarc
we aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. he supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child.	come on, people. you don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. there's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. and if no one else would have, i would have.	notsarc
revisionist history by gays is still revisionist history. while aids can be spread through heterosexual sex, i stated that it was homosexual sex that put aids over the critical mass needed to perpetuate and spread. deny that. emoticonxcensored	"so aids is the fault of ""the gays""?emoticonxrolleyes   lol it's been a long time, jp."	sarc
americans as a whole don't say soccer sucks; we just don't give a rat's xxx about it.	"the same way most people on planet earth dont give a xxxx about american ""football""  "	sarc
is this the sort of thing that is being taught at that bastion of liberal science, mit? how can this be presented as fact rather than theory?new and improved nuclear fuel creatednuclear fission, neutrons and protons, and even the atom itself are just theories. no one has ever seen an atom or a neutron. no one has ever observed an atom split. why are our liberal news media allowed to present this as fact?moreover, aren't nuclear reactors designed by intelligent humans? i also notice that this research was funded by our hard earned tax dollars without requiring that the benevolence of god also be researched in equal time. this is yet another shameful example of the godless attitude of science.	thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms, neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions. now as i gaze at the night sky with all its' bits and pieces spinning around each other i can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall.	sarc
[b]let it not be said the grace of god for salvation in jesus christ is not freely available.	does this mean that you have finally repented of your multiple divorces??	sarc
why do the 'loving' christians always threaten eternal torment when you ask them for information?	i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?	sarc
as i said above, would you care to link to the description section where it say's this, because i couldn't find it. that would clear this up and prove your point that i'm in error. how bout it?	archie, it's already 'cleared up' that you're a liar. you claimed to know what he was about. you claimed it was a 'secular site that's dedicated to exposing the homosexual, extreme left, communist and anarchist agenda'. but he's not really interested in 'homosexuality' at all. and i find you're 'couldn't find it' to be incredibly absurd. it's on the web-page where he talks about the event in the first place. if you actually start clicking to see the pics and his comments, it's right there! i'm not linking to pornographic material on this web-site. the header of that web-page reads:  'up your alley fair san francisco, july 27, 2008 part 1' i am incredibly amused that you repeatedly lie all over the place on this web-site, but then you press others for proof.	sarc
the only stupid gun laws are the laws that arent strict enoughlike the law that gun nuts wanted that would allow children to tote around assault rifleshow stupid can you be	what laws are these that you speak of? kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering brady campaign and violence policy center.during world war ii the american people rounded up japanese-americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. what you're speaking of is no different than this.the way i see it brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.	notsarc
he was arrested and spent several hours in a cell when plainly he had not broken any laws.	plain with the benefit of hindsight. i love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. if it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, i'm sure.	sarc
i don't think the rich in any country are comparable to the poor in the us.	the poor in the us certainly seem to eat more than the rich in most countries.	sarc
promoting renewables is a good thing, but increasing the supply of oil in counter productive in helping renewables to reach the critical mass needed to survive economically.	if we could rub a brass lamp, make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately, i'd agree with you. but since we live in the real world, we must become oil independent while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources.	sarc
why even bother with courts? between the nancy grace's of the world and several other people i have noticed, there is no longer any such thing as innocent. therefore, perhaps, we should just send anybody charged with a crime straight to jail and just save everybody a whole lot of time and money. i was for sure he was guilty. should i put my faith in a jury? should i put my faith in our courts? do i know better than them? i watch tv! of course i know better than them! nancy grace even says he's guilty! what more do we need to know? from now on, they should just fire all the judges and lawyers and let me decide. </sarcasm>  from now on, your future is in my hands! :p there will be no appeals! :p	i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?	notsarc
this from the guy who let's cheney run the government. i truly wonder what will happen if his ticker gives out. he can't even stand for any length of time - always needs a stool.	  how do you know bush let's cheney run the government..oh yeah, that's right, cnn/cbs told you. so you will knock one of the greatest minds this country has because he has a bad heart and can't stand for long periods of time? what a goober, so i guess stephen hawking should die too, huh?  	sarc
no, what the blacks did was dress in african clothes and let their afros grow out. they stopped trying to follow the image that was being imposed on them, and instead embraced what they were. that's all that's happening here. they're not hiding their sexuality in the closet any longer, despite, or even because of, the fact that people like you would like them to.	somehow i think most people are going to be a lot more comfortable with their kids seeing people in african atire with long hair than with scantily-dressed (or topless) people simulating sex acts. emoticonxrolleyes   	sarc
really? do you know how many people get shot in the uk? handgun violence has gone up.	but your own link says that the rise in crime was partially explained by the new system the uk police were using for recording crime and that the british crime survey showed a decrease in crime since 1997.	notsarc
i believe there is special dispensation for those who've never had a chance to hear the good news. the last pope mentioned something dealing with this a few years ago iirc. this is also why the great commision for christians is evangelism.	but you know what really doesn't make sense? why are they evangelising to people (who they know most of them will reject them) if those people get a special dispensation? they'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing, would they not? why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation? emoticonxconfused	notsarc
hmmm? okay, what if i chose to reproduce via binary fission? will both of me go to heaven?	only one of you i guess this is when the score card will come in handy	notsarc
many evolutionists are pretty bright, yes, no one can deny that.	and it remains to be seen if your are. pick an unreasonable and dumb argument go with it.	sarc
too late. the only people around here i see driving new gm products (other than p/u trucks) with temp paper plates were probably on active duty in ww2.	well, i'm not surprised. the left coast rarely gets anything right. :)  btw, gm still has over 25% of the domestic vehicle market and it didn't get it by selling econoboxes like the japanese did.	notsarc
personally i don't believe in abortion. it's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal.	i think often abortion is wrong but i do not agree with criminalizing it. primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. a woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. i am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if i were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood i would end it - and i will not be checking the law books first. every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. there are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. the reasons are valid.	notsarc
meanwhile, there must have been provisions on the ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water ph and saline content. also not mentioned is the fact that noah and sons must have collected seeds from every plant on earth because i am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days.	oh really ? parts of new orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? of course it has. the earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah	notsarc
and nobody has ever managed to do so (though the concept of an invisible man in the sky is a little silly).	but it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.i think maybe the kids should be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is.	notsarc
creation scientists read the sedimentary record of the placement of strata as evidence of the great flood while evo scientists read the same evidence very differently, as evidence of an old earth.	and creationists who can't tell the difference between cats and nuclear reactors don't understand fluid mechanics.	sarc
i also visited the university's website and looked at their data. there does appear to be information which contradicts with the above listed article's claims (e.g. - http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/te...ure/nhshgl.gif). not sure what he is talking about.	"it is pretty bizzare. there are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever ""conclusion"" you pay them to reach. why he didn't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me."	notsarc
3a) if you do the math, severe earthquakes (caused by god) could have very easily covered the earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points. also, with these severe earthquakes, not all of the earth would have to be covered equally at one time. there could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below.3b) who said the earth started out as a flat super continent? i believe that god made the earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now.	you contradict yourself. if the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. i have done the math. do you have any idea of how high the himalayas, the alps, the andes, and the rockies are? besides, the bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis.	notsarc
did you miss the part where it is... the attempt to abort. which kills the women.it is not child birth that kills those women.it is an attempt to abort.if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died.having a child, is not a trajedy... its just part of life.its not a wrongful burden... or a flaw of existance.. its nature.dah... do you even read what is being posted?-mosheh thezion	yes, do you? it's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. a country full of hiv and aids. i wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had hiv/aids and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.	notsarc
the movement of charged particles is not matter. matter moves. the movement itself is not matter	that's deep.  movement is not matter, i will use that the next time i decide to babble.  are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?  your funny.	sarc
but by that definition, either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom, including your view impeding on hers! we don't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals. it doesn't effect your religion or religious freedom if you don't get benefits under gay marriages. you can argue in other ways, on other basis, but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty 'argument'.	but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.	notsarc
anyone who wants to legalize bringing a weapon onto a plane is an idiot.simply stated...always stay open minded	you have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument.	sarc
stabbing yourself is not ok, but that doesn't mean it should be illegal. i'm not even going to bother with your non-sequitor, but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink. of course guns are only used to hurt others by criminals - shooting someone is a criminal act. unfortunately by the time you find out that the person is a criminal their victim is bleeding out on the floor. illegal guns are generally guns that were previously held legally, whether they have been modified or stolen.	[quote=jo bennett;314232]stabbing yourself is not ok, but that doesn't mean it should be illegal. i'm not even going to bother with your non-sequitor, but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink. these are mostly caused by illegal guns. you can't outlaw something thats already illegal. i highly doubt this. how can a gun be illegal when it used to be legal? most illegal guns are bought off the black market.	notsarc
gays are more prone to hiv infection...maybe they have bad role models. maybe old camp fruits like you are not the best role models. 'sex with whore or sex with gay..put a rubber on it'...get that tatooed on your forehead and do your gay friends a favour	behavior dictates risk. some practices are 'more risky' than others. but to say gays are more prone to hiv infection, suggest that heterosexuals are immune, or less prone...which is factually false. role models?? what are you talking about? you don't even know.  old camp fruits? you've lost the little mind that you had.  your daddy is more of an 'old camp fruit', than i ever could be, girlfriend.  and i'm in a monogamous marriage for the past 10 years. i need no announcements. you?	sarc
"the phrase ""#### hits the fan"" refers to what would happen if such an event occurred, a big mess. for example ""big jimmy just found out sly jones was sleeping with his wife, the #### is really going to hit the fan now!""substituting something else into the metaphor other than #### renders it meaningless, its unclear what would happen if a ""theory"" hit a fan, are you trying to say it would make a mess, that nothing would happen, that it would spin in circles?"	i'm glad you made the same correlation i did. toe is a substitute for #### in this case.	notsarc
wow. symbiote has your number on this one. you're in full-out back-pedal mode here, huh? again, give some proof of causality about that claim, and then we'll talk. not whatever you're shifting to as your 'hypothesis' to avoid having to back up the claim you made in your first post.	and jyoshu is in full cheer-leader mode... what the heck did i supposedly back-peddle on? please. be explicit. no wait. you're not going to answer that, are you... roflmao! symbiote runs around proclaiming all sorts of things (falsely) as my supposed hypothesis, and you pretend that me refusing to take up her strawman approach is somehow 'back-peddling'? more like the blind leading the blind, walking in circles and thinking they are travelling quickly! as for proof, do you understand what 'hypothesis' means in the first place? look it up.	sarc
again, i don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime. the reason for having a gun is as you stated - to stop the crime once it has begun (though this may prevent a worse crime from occurring).	i think some people will and have argued that. i'll work on finding a quote, but i believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent scotus ruling, home invasion in dc would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. you do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.	notsarc
just in case anyone's interested, recent research into bumblebee flight was conducted by professor ismet gursul at the university of bath, uk. the paper was titled 'unsteady vortex flows over slender delta wings' and appeared in the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics journal last year, i believe. i can't find any direct info from the paper online, but here's a short article about it: research cracks puzzle of why the bumble bee can fly so well  and just because i'm a pedant, it's spelt gullible! i think i've seen 3 or 4 different spellings of it in this thread. no offense, i am just a massive spelling pedant.	find me a spell check plugin for firefox liminus. i had one for ie before i switched over.  frankly, i'm not surprised we're going to use that for police and military applications.	notsarc
safer by openly carrying unloaded handguns? that's the law in ca.  of course you can have a loaded magazine or two on the other hip. http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?sec...bay&id=7261522	oh? what keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest? i suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. you wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? how many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?	sarc
that's it? that was your post? to attack a source without anything backing you up? bravo!	it's as much of a point that phillp johnson has. trying to use philip johnson as a source about evolution is like trying to use jack chick as a source about catholism.	sarc
i would appreciate it if some of you experts could give me some simple answers to a couple simple questions and help me with some of my doubts.	and that's why i think you are a troll. there really aren't any experts here. there are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. it also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.	sarc
and all having a real, verifiable negative impact on society, which cannot be said about gay marriage. can we tone down the drama a little bit?	for years i've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. to date, no takers. want to step up?	notsarc
perhaps when the roman catholic church has cleansed itself of its own sins it could have a dialogue with women about abortion--which is not a sin.	that's is ridiculously poor logic. simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. the us government is way more corrupt than the catholic church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do. 	notsarc
if only more people were armed this tragedy might have been minimised.	so how is the oil and gas agreement with china working out for you antipodeans?	sarc
its a download link for a pdf file provided by nasa about guadalupe (which i gave you before). but heres an article that might amuse you.you may do more research if you wish though i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people, but does have the time to create guadalupe's eyes. i am really glad that your great being is doing lots with his power.	i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. dont you think its about time to stop the denials and face the facts? you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people,  indeed. christianity are a fool for thinking that god is a good person	sarc
you mean the conservative tilting supremes donot know the law ? you want to tell them that ? emoticonxchicken emoticonxchicken emoticonxchicken emoticonxchicken emoticonxchicken	you'd be hard-pressed to get me to agree with your definition of 'conservative' . and i'd love to tell them. do you have their e-mail addresses? i'll start with chickenshit kennedy.	sarc
i agree entirely. death is a much kinder sentence than life in prison, if you are sentenced to life, you should get to suffer for the whole bit.	"funny how people who are ""for"" capital punishment don't see it that way..."	sarc
5) what experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design?	a lot of work has been done on that topic. i would recommend reading debating design from darwin to dna it is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read.	notsarc

"and i'll bet the formal list of ""great physicists"" who preceded the development of the theory of evolution is meaningful. i wonder how many of these ""great physicists"" also believed that night air could make them ill? how many beleived in alchemy, like newton? i wonder if newton is in that list? he didn't believe in the divinity of christ."	this was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were bible believing christians. right. many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the bible (they were wrong). if it is important that newton believed in the bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of christ.there isn't any such thing as science from a christian perspective. either it is science, or it isn't.you claimed to have studied evolution. you didn't. why would you tell us that you did?	notsarc
this sounds utterly nutsy. it could only be said by someone who knows diddly squat about babies. hah! anger isn't an emotion? so, what do you think a new born baby goes through? what is this already? i'm out of my nice, cozy little nest, there are bright lights, loud noises unmuffled, it's cold, i feel icky and i am really angry! waaaaaaah! happiness isn't an emotion? whew! i went waaaaah and now i'm cozy and warm, my tummy is full, my bottom is dry, someone is cooing soothing sounds at me. . . . where is your head, steeeeeeve?	jitobear, i always love it when you post. you are succinct and to the point and i always wish i had said what you said.	notsarc
i won't throw my ideas on abortion out there just yet, but i have to ask this question. should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion?for example: jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year. jack gets injured by bob, and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation. jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years. since jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation, nost likely all he will be entitled to is $1000.so- shouldn't child support be limited to the cost of an abortion, under our current pro-abortion laws?	this is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence(sp). if so, you can't really sue for amounts of money you might get in the future. he could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures. so ya know :). i don't really know what the question is.	notsarc
not a chance. i'm your worst nightmare; a straight, white, conservative male that votes religiously and sees through liberal bs. :p	not really dearie, you're just ssdd. you're not unique or even all that intellegent. you just follow the crowd because you haven't an original thought in your head. but that's ok, we don't blame you, per se, we know you can't control your behavior. emoticonxrolleyes	sarc
am i missing something, or does the linked article have nothing to do with what you said?	it's the first couple of paragraghs from the article in this weeks ns. if you had an online subscription or got a copy from your newsagent you could read the whole thing, unfortunately with this one the intro rambles on a bit and doesn't get to the point till the second column...	notsarc

according to the old testament, sodom and gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor (which is nearly an essential part of capitalism), not because of homosexuality. according to the old testament, you must also murder people of different faiths in cold blood by stoning them to death, especially your friends and family.	well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. they are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. even though we know that before the angels were ever sent god had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. he sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. they failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. they can't see past the supposed homosexual issue.	notsarc

"i support legalization of every drug. i'm sure most of you are young and have been fed xxxx like ""marijuana will kill you."" actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. it is impossible. it takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. you know that idiot pothead. he didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. marijuana does not have long term effects on iq. the only side effect is the lazy side effect. the day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. there is no reason why it should remain illegal.i also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. we spend billions each year on the drug war and i can call someone right now and pick up some crack. it is a failure. what we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. flood the schools with actual info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. if we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. there are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. anyone want to fight it? i have proof to back up what i say and also have the effects of each drug."	"recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. one joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.i doubt your 20,000 joints theory.you have a simplistic argument going for pot. i can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. programs in holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. the druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.one ""benefit"" i see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified."	notsarc
"it doen't matter what trimester it is in. the shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life. by arguing if the baby is considered living, is just people's way of trying to justify what they already know is wrong, hoping that the excuse of ""if the baby isn't conscious of it, then it isn't that wrong."" it doesn't matter if the baby knows it or not. even if it was conscious of it, it won't care in a second. the moral dilemma comes in that, you had the intent of killing and that is what makes abortion in any stage morally wrong!!!!the better question is, should the government take action? because this is a wierd situation where the life is still 100% dependent of the mom and therefore a part of her body. the argument of a soul is negligable because there is no proof of the exsistence to of souls.i have no answer for you, just a plea to please keep an open mind and have compassion for both sides of the argument. it is the only way we can create progress and not hate."

yes, particuarly if you understand the puns in the original hebrew.  adam (mankind) is related to the word (adamah), which means 'red clay'. this is in turn releated to the word edom , which means 'blood'.  the word translated as 'created' is more like the term 'formed', as a potter forms a piece of clay.  so, if you look at it properly, we can see that genesis is saying 'god formed man as a potter forms clay out of flesh and blood'.  the word 'eve' is the word for love. so we can also point out that 'god formed man out of flesh and blood, and gave him love for companionship. that is all without going into the political comentary about conditions between the various cultures at the time.	that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!	sarc

sorry to burst your bubble, but non-gene inheritance is non-materiastic inheritance, which absolutely does contradict toe.

no. it would show that the government actually opposed the hostage takers.  over the last generation or so, the dutch became quite good at rescuing hostages from the hijacked trains that became an annual event; the russians lost a number of hostages in a theater a few years ago when the gas they used proved a bit strong; and the filipinos became notorious for losing all hostages. but in every case where hostages were lost, the government was criticized for lack of competence rather than complicity. in iran, the mullahs were tacitly complicit in the crime. surrender to terrorism, such as you propose, does not work in the real world - it only encourages the terrorists.	the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.	notsarc

true, but it does make evolution a known factor, and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones.	and evolution is exhausted. it can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more.	notsarc
you mention pursuing facts? i don't see how that's possible. for now assume that god created the earth and the science commnity accepts that. what specific experimentation would you do? what would you investigate that you feel could further the human pool of knowledge? how about some specifics?	as i mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. one's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. an agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. there may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. it goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students how to think, not what to think.	notsarc
it begins to look, then, that this is a piece of crude propaganda (see note below), deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question, and that the fanciful notions of creation `scientists' are contributing to that debate.

"you are so right-on in what you say!in a sunday school at a church i formerly attended, an elder of the church remarked that his ""faith was strengthened"" by the ""evidence"" afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east. in a tone i now rather regret, i blurted out two things......how weak was your faith before?and...if the ""evidence"" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened?his answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use.his response to the first was problematic, and interesting. ""my faith,"" he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--""complete."" but he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that i pressed no further. i wish sometimes that i'd asked: if your faith was ""always complete,"" did the archaeological evidence make it ""more complete""? and, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?i do not quite grasp the notion of there being ""scientific evidence"" for a proposition within the realm of faith. i do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. activity in one realm may be felt in the other.but, re: evolution, i think this...given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't ""disprove the bible."" rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--i call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. i'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain christians' interpretations. emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some christians see in, for example, the genesis ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" nothing more than a tree. a biological tree. pear tree. peach tree. apple tree. tree of the knowledge of good and evil. albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. and, for them, there you go--eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain christians.science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. i feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than i do about that person's science.master_shake, for your poignantly apt remark--""what they have isn't faith at all""--thanks. bless you!brad"	you can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. there are very many forms of evidence.	notsarc

without question my largest beef with god would have to be the fact that according to the bible you need to believe in god in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. the reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in india than if you are born in the us or europe. the indian culture is that of hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the us and europe which is primarily christian. that means being born in the us or europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a christian and believing in god. would the be at all fair if this were the case? my answer is plainly and simply no! it is idiotic infact. if god existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. his system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to god's expectations. if not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. god in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but i just don't see spelled out in the bible.	why would anyone want to get to heaven? archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . thanks but no thanks!	sarc

incidentally, is the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and intelligent design are two names for the same thing? while i agree that they are more similar to each other than to evolution, it troubles me that anyone would believe that they are synonymous. for those that think the title is justified, what about the two beliefs do you find similar enough to class them as the same idea?	because of the history of it. well, id is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. let's just say that i.d. is an attempt to teach creationism in school.	notsarc

hm. to me that sounds frighteningly similar to something that could be heard several decades ago: 'our schools should only teach white children. we don't hate gays or anything, we just oppose having them in schools with our children, it just isn't possible to us to allow them in our school. we aren't really opposed to them going to school, we'll support that as long as they go to their own school for blacks and aren't allowed in our white schools. allowing them in the white schools is just silly.'  i'm sorry, but just like what was decided back then, seperate but equal is never equal. basically they are saying that gays are somehow inferior and have to be put in their own instisution lest they sully the institution of marriage (something heteros are doing without anyone else's help).	separate but equal is never equal? which are better? boys' or girls' bathrooms? other than that last statement i agree 100%. i don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be. unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union.	notsarc

"it's just a term for someone who has decided to live in a way that isn't gay. they may be ""gay"" physiologically (whatever that means in terms of biology), but they are living in a way that doesn't give in to that--which is what matters from their religious standpoint. many people live against urges (regarding various issues) all the time. ironically, gay pride has itself largely to blame for the 'ex-gay' movement. i think it's an example of some gays swinging back against the 'out-and-proud' far left shift--religious gays are, in effect, saying they don't have to abide by your prescription for their lives."

nope, your argument fails again. nothing in the heller ruling suggests that gun rationing laws are constitutional in nature. at best heller was simply saying that the individual rights nature of the second amendment doesn't automatically rule all gun control null and void. but then again nobody was really expecting it to. the details of what is allowable and what isn't haven't been hammered out yet. but i would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison, a felony conviction record, and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair, reasonable, tough on crime, and constitutional in nature. go ahead and try. we'll wait.	"what is conveniently missing from your response? an explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" per heller. if the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is constitutionally protected. executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. however, that does not mean that there is a constitutional right to shoplift."	notsarc
your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed.if the chance of mutation a happening is one in a billion, and the chance of mutation b happening is also one in a billion, then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is, as you say, beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.however, we're not talking about a single gene. a population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual, and all of them will contain the same gene. so while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation a are very low, the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high. the lottery works on the same principle. you probably won't win, but someone probably will.ok, so now we have our billion bacteria, one of which possesses mutation a. however, the odds of mutation b stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000,000,000.now, if mutation a isn't particularly helpful, that's probably the end of the story. but if mutation a is helpful, then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources, and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms, or better in immediate proximity, when in competition for the same resources. either way, the proportion of the population possessing mutation a will increase until they predominate. now there isn't just one copy of the a-mutant gene in circulation, there are about a billion, and the odds of mutation b stacking with just one of them are greatly improved. once again, if mutation b is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population, so that in a relatively short time (a few hundred bacterial generations) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion-to-one mutations - a population ready for the next billion-to-one mutation to occur, and stack, and flourish, and so on.i hope that helps.	well this is what i am saying. the probability of a and b in one organism i very low. and the probability of a and b in many generations is lower than just a. this is what behe deals with in his book. one reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. it involves real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   imo there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of rm being cause of the changes.	notsarc
as has been pointed out to you now more than once, the most that can be ascertained from the evidence is that it was possibly done in some places--perhaps in remote areas or areas that were not entirely in lockstep with rome (or constantinople early on). there is much more evidence that the rcc has been consistent in it's belief that gay relationships are not a holy matrimony.

you can preach pretty religious philosophy all day long but i ain't buying. saying that jesus told you that all life is special doesn't comfort a rape victim, doesn't provide health care to a woman without it, doesn't feed a family if a single mom has to quit her job, doesn't provide an education if she has to quit school. reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen doesn't mean squat out in here in the real world, and it doesn't indicate that you get it, let alone care.	just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. i think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). this doesnt negate the truth though.	notsarc
the california legislature--the people's elected representatives--have, over the last two years, twice voted to legitimise same-sex marriages in california.  that's in the last two years, not eight years ago, when the odious, unconstitutional prop. 22 was passed.  gov. schwarzenegger vetoed it both times, saying--contrary to the usual the 'activist judges' complainants--that he preferred the court to decide. which it has. tough titty.	so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism.	sarc

cute, but not quite. the claim is that we want everybody to have guns. so i'd like to see some proof that gun owners have called for the repealing of the federal age limit that covers the purchase of firearms, and for the prohibited persons list that keeps felons, the insane, the drug addicted, and those that beat their wives, from legally buying guns. if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals, terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns, then i'd like to see them. otherwise the claim that we want everybody armed is nothing more than a lie. the private property of whom? we have security stops along the mexican/american border to search for drugs and other contraband. how is it not possible on the way to and from dc?	simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.	notsarc
wrong - a 1 month old has human organs, a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks has no human organs. that's the difference . this is a fact and the question is not whether the human organs are fully developed or not but the fact that there are no human organs at all in a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks.	do you have to have human organs to be considered a person? who made this rule??? you? what if you get lung removed...are you less of a person? so around 8 weeks though you believe it is in fact a human?  	sarc

i must say, that first paragraph you wrote really interests me. i've become so accustomed to speaking to hereditary theists that i wasn't sure it was even possible to be religious with atheist parents. if you don't mind my asking, who introduced you to christianity? or was it some sort of overnight process, as in you woke up and just believed through some some divine revelation?	i'm surprised, maybe your area of the uk is different, but in mine nearly all atheists are hereditary, or they just break away from the religions of their parents because they dislike their parents instead of the religion.	notsarc

on this 35th anniversary of the roe v. wade decision, i would like to share my views on the issue of abortion.life begins at the point of conception. no one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue. what astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. they prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. what ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! does the father of the child have a say in this? and what about the constitution of the united states? are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? i believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. we need to overturn the roe v. wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. for a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.	you have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?and to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?smiley	notsarc

pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. sugar coating it doesn't change the fact that the sexist term, 'pro-choice' should be abolished and it should be replaced with what it really is, 'pro-abortion.' ;)	pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this.	notsarc

[quote=toby][quote] the relative context, in this instance, is understood to be the assertion that a moral consensus is limited by a shifting perspective - i.e. changing from time to time and from place to place, etc.  a radical relativist might say that's what attila should do - even assuming you have some heinous behaviour in mind: i'm not. it might be argued that moral sentiments are instinctive. i'm not going quite that distance: i'm saying that moral values are expressions of approval/disapproval that don't arise from rational deliberation, but from the affective part of human nature.	fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?	notsarc

"so, you think there is a god? bad design does not equate to no design. it really is a poor argument.much of the force of darwin's arguments deal with bad design. i invite anyone to post any of darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of ""bad"" design. that said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. one could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.your audio cd's have reed-solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. cleary this is ""bad design"" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. same with modems and host of other devices. clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. all the characters should be pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. life and the divine drama, like cd's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.the reason audio cd's have so many read/write errors which are corrected reed-solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a cd as possible. the tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the shannon capacity theorem.the mp3's and jpegs are even more ""error"" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.a similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. the goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency. the point is ""bad"" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all. the high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio cd suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.origin of species chapter 13:there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. we see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. it is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. in monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? as owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ? on the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by owen who rather despised darwin and his ideas.darwin tries to argue why a designer would not use the same for the same function. he says homology is evidence of an unwise design. the premise is a creator wouldn't be so inefficient.but, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of ""bad design"" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio cd's or fuel inefficient cars). the biotic message theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. like a great novel, the ""imperfections"" of biology are part of a larger plot.it is turning out, darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis."	you are assuming that the toe of evolution has remained static since darwins time.i have to say that is false. we have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. in addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up. so sorry, but you struck out.	notsarc

so, you don't judge! then it's okay to lump all christians together!evidently, that makes it all better!so much for being a free-thinker.but then again, you never addressed the issue i asked you about slavery.you claimed to be moral, based on democratic ideals of moarlity... but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the usa!it was christians who aimed higher. i'm sorry if you want to talk past that, and say i disgust you.	uhhhh, i just said that i do judge! so what in the hell are you talking about? you're not well. i didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. i disagree with your claims as i suspect would most historians. but it doesn't surprise me that christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.	sarc
this liberal hypocrisy makes me sick...more and more sick.  right after monica, clinton dropped bombs in iraq. not a word from the left, silence.  clinton laid out reasons why we should carry out that extensive bombing campaign in 1998. no un resolution, no congressional votes, no complaints from the left.  clinton tooks us to fight dictators killing thousands in their countries over and over. not a word from the left. saddam is doing the same...words from the left. i'm tired...i'll add later.	it must because he's a liberal. hey sarah, how come bushie's daddy, cheney, and rumsfeld all used to rub elbows with saddam? must be cause they were led astray by some liberal...	sarc

read the article, it tells you who found the quote (site intelligence group). in any case, my point is would it matter? these groups are as likely to be pulling reverse psychology (at least in public statements) as anything else, i was pointing out the absurdity of using such endorsements to score political points. btw if you wanted to attack the source, you'd be far better pointing out that the poster, while posting on an extremist website, is not actually an al qaeda member or representative of any kind. rather than actually doing some research, you just put your fingers in your ears and claim the source doesn't exist.	bs, if it's password protected, then how would they access it? then i suppose america would look lovely as the crater in the death star! you're telling me to believe that it exists even though there is no evidence that it does? once again: there's a witness in this courtroom who says that i didn't kill that guy, but i'm the only one who can see him and hear him. in other words, unless the page is showed to me, i have no reason to believe that it exists.	sarc

in the following example that you provided: what is the context of the word 'truncated'? the way i read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. what was truncated?	the gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. lpl is the designation for a gene that encodes lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. the actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. one study was able to identify 3 common snps (single nucleotide polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in european populations. the third snp converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. thus, the enzyme has been truncated. the resulting enzyme, lpl s447x, is functional. in fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.	notsarc

so why did toe ignore horizontal gene transfer for so many decades? can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally (without going through selection) validates darwinism, which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted?	it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.	notsarc
as explained the last time we crossed paths matthew, there is no evidence presented that would suggest homosexualism is in any way a legitimate aspect of life for differentiating one from another. simply because you possess different sexual ideals from someone else does not mean that you and those like you are worth special consideration by society. your continued comparison of homosexuals to blacks does nothing to make your point anymore valid.	religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth.	notsarc

or maybe we have a mental disability? yes, it is not common to show anger when you are happy. however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth?  i always wonder if the majority is wrong? what i mean is: what if the people in the mental hospitals are mentally normal and those who are classifed as normal are not normal?  you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure. that is my problem. how do you know for sure if the emotion you choose is correct? please give an example of this sonnet?  lol we are so off topic. i don't want to spam her debate. lets continue this debate in the messaging system please.	however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many.	notsarc

i watched a program on einstein and his theory of relativity yesterday on the history channel. good stuff. i'm a little interested in what he was working on when he croaked - the unification theory. that will develop more in time and then i'll pay more attention to it. i think god is the great physicist, and we'll see the beauty of his laws of physics in due time. 'for the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. he has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.'

i think this is rather simple. there will be a decrease in volume or quantity of healthcare services. this will not include time of doctors who mostly tell their spport staff to do yet another test. so it will mostly include support staff, administrative staff, equipment manufacturers. they will not necessarily get paid less, there will just be fewer of them. per person that is.	"well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. so do i understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?edit: that seems dramatic...not ""fire"" them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed."	notsarc

if minorities' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives, then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system.	and the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. they are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. the fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. as has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. that's not what a democracy is about, at least not our democracy.	notsarc

gun sales are booming nationwide — and in erie county, applications for pistol permits are rolling in at nearly three times last year's rate, the county clerk's office reports. meanwhile, in the nation's capital, gun control has become, in essence, dead on arrival. chalk it all up to the election of a democratic president with a long record of supporting gun restrictions and a congress that includes a surprising number of pro-gun democrats from rural areas. the election of barack obama as president is sparking a run on firearms and ammunition in both buffalo and nationwide, according to gun dealers and experts on the issue.	unfortunately democrats have a credibility problem. many pro-gun democrats have been elected, and america is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe obama because of his past anti-gun support and votes. however   ms. feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control  did not help the creditability problem either. i guess only time will tell.	notsarc

well this is what i am saying. the probability of a and b in one organism i very low. and the probability of a and b in many generations is lower than just a. 	actually, if you look at the example i've given, that's false. the probability of a in one organism may be low, but the probability of a in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. and if a is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an ab individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. in the example above, the chance of an ab mutant occurring, if a and b are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. it would be amazing if they didn't stack. so saying that ab occurring is less likely than a is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.	notsarc

how should i respond to coming back after some time to be immediately called chisler, con artist, stupid? nevermind my observation that left to your own devices, days go by where you either follow up your own posts or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate canned anti-gun control rhetoric. i calls them as i sees them.  you might recall that initially you pro-gun guys rejected even the suugestion that american semi-autos would be of any interest to the cartels when they could get full autos on the black market. how then do you attribute the fact that 70% of the rifles seized in reynoso last november, the biggest single seizure to date, traced to the us? that's why i posted that story. that's my question for you guys. apparently they have some use for semi-autos afterall.	i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy.	sarc
"in a few decades, it might be possible that technological progress would develop an ""artificial womb"" that can nurture a fetus almost from day one until birth. how would that change the abortion debate?"	that would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. it would depend, i think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. forced surgery would not be an option if i had anything to do about it.	notsarc
i think this might be the wrong thread for this discussion. something like this belongs in the crime debate area, where i'm currently handing jo his head over and over again.	you lie. you keep saying the same things over and over again, that doesn't make them true. your addiction to violence is showing.tony martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away. that's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.it is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them. you don't get to take the law into your own hands. munir hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street. that's not self-defence, that's revenge.	notsarc
i think it might show the true character of some people... i may disagree with you and others but i won't go spray painting your house or tearing down any ad you put up. whatever happened to respect for others? this applies to pro-life and pro-choice by the way.	and if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. i can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. people have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.	notsarc

no, it has not, despite what you and your girlfriend say. and, whether it supports my pov, as i believe it does, is not the point. the point is that my pov is valid, scientific, and becoming increasingly accepted, while your darwinist boat, riddled with leaks and worm holes from day one, is finally being allowed to sink to the bottom without further plugging up and bailing out	well actually i have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least one scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. quick search reveals no mentions at all. of course if you say its displacing nds then i guess i will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but i remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical.	sarc
you can choose to have faith i whatever you want. some feel the bible represents the historical accounts of jesus. it could be mythical, magical or whatever. but, there are many who feel this is real and was produced to represent fact not fiction. you can choose to believe it or not. i don't think that the harry potter series was ever considered anything but fiction. and, i said i interpret it as i desire...not.others. yes, practices at the time condoned many of the things you state, but the bible was about jesus with many of the practices of the time added as historical color not relevant to the actual text itself.	i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't.	sarc

what??? you mean they don't think that most people are out to exterminate gays? that most people actually do have reasons for their beliefs, and that the world doesn't always line up with the all-or-nothing 'equality-obsessed' modern gay pride movement?  who'da thunk it? emoticonxgood  the idea that most people hate gays is, of course, a propagandist view by the gay pride movement. i would hope judges wouldn't fall into that way of thinking, and the fact these judges did not shows they are good judges.	no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status.	notsarc

i suspect that those statistics are harder to find and harder to determine (since, once a person is dead, there is much less motivation to prove him innocent). nevertheless, various sources mention a number of people who have been executed despite probable innocence. here is just one of numerous sites that i found with a google search. this site (a few years old)claims that 25 people in the last 25 years have been executed despite probable innocence. http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/25casesdraft.html anyway, i don't think there is a formal procedure to establish official innocence after death. i don't think the mechanisms are in place in our justice system to have a trial for the dead, so we can only look at the evidence in the cases that people have privately pursued.	ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out.	notsarc
i don't pretend to know what is behind your movement, but you obviously hate society.	wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake.	sarc

** nonsense. that may be what you suppose exterrestrial life to be like, and as you are a materialist/mechanist, i'm not surprised to hear you say it. but i demand to see all of the intrinsic life functions that are in my posted definition, included within a complex, self-aware, self-organizing, self-supporting, self-serving system, before i confuse any artefact with a genuinely live organism. ** i wouldn't bet the farm on that, but even if true, it's the functions and what enables those functions that counts, not the construction material involved. ** energy, mass. inertia, and all of the four material forces are no more empirically observable than the life force, but you can infer them from their observed effects upon corporeal matter; just as you can observe the effects of the life force upon corporeal matter. deny life and you can deny gravity by the exact same token. but you do so at peril of making a fool of yourself. ** only upon a cursory examination that is unjustifiably satisfied with appearance. sort of like thinking that a carney magician really can work miracles, or getting fooled by movie effects. only worse.  ** only obliquely, as all of the artefacts of true living things do. in that sense, 'life' had a real effect upon it, since life created and maintains it for life's (i.e., its creator's) purposes. ** that, too. ** what you materialist/mechanists always fail to understand is that 'chemical interactions' are merely observed facts. they do not explain anything, including themselves. what they really do, is to require explaining themselves. ** nothing at all, provided you do not reduce the whole of reality, and its contents, to bits of stuff that get moved in space from one point to another, and on and on. oops!! that's materialist/mechanist ontology in a nutshell, and so that's exactly what you do believe!! ** there is none, because it isn't. check the definition of 'life'. your little toy doesn't fit it any better than a child's 'wets itself' doll 'appears' to have a functioning metabolic system. let's get real from now on, shall we?	ww, are you talking to yourself?  if not, then please learn how to attribute statements to the person who made them.	sarc
it's been a long standing standard that if the only motivation for a law, act, etc is religious, then it's a violation of socas. if a proposed law just happens to agree with your religion, or if religion is just one small part of the motivation, then it's not a problem. but if you take out religion and you're left with pretty much nothing, then you've got an issue.	well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. i think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. the 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for that reason. it got rescinded because it didn't work practically.

madison rejected all changes to the constitution that he thought would weaken the federal government, including its control over the militia. as he rhetorically asked, 'for whose benefit is the militia organized, armed and disciplined? for the benefit of the united states.'[91] he was willing to respond to the fears of the antifederalists by granting the states, in carl bogus's words, 'a concurrent authority [page 74] to arm their militia.'[92] the result was a single sentence with a clarifying preamble: 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'[93] chicago-kent law review	i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.	sarc
then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority.	but pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. not just religion. (and in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) this isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).	notsarc

i keep hearing gays say that but every time it's put to a vote, you lose. i'd say that it's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition. the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action. and when they respond on the ballot, they do so punatively.just wait until you see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee's same sex partners bennies on our dime despite doma. i'm guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies.you need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences. i believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage. and i count myself amongst that majority.	actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose.and how am i forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? am i forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare i say be in a marriage themselves?and i cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...what i find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...but actually like i stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples i would be content.	notsarc

well, it seems that even the simplest of messages failed to penetrate some thick (sick) skulls: without guns you can not shoot and kill anybody. civilized remove all guns from circulation and do their utmost to also make gus unavailable to criminals and it works. only insecure, paranoid people with and inferiority complex need guns as a security blanket. grow up!	yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference.	sarc

ecause of his direct encounter with christ in a special way. it is not necessary that all the apostles should be equally inspired to only write teachings and letters like paul, just like all the organs of a body do not take part of the same the function, but the nevertheless, all contribute to the making and building of the body.	why do conservatives support conservatives? paul's theology found favor with the christians that won amongst the early churches. paul was not considered an apostle by the original 11 and barnabas. luke doesn't have him meet a risen jesus only paul says he did. his first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with barnabas.but the apostles did not teach the same as paul, similiar but not the same.	notsarc

do you support the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public schools?yes because it is the flipside to science and everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe.	how about other religious theories. what about teaching about the sun god? i don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the earth and other massive objects. we should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.  	sarc

so by your various definitions, left-handedness makes that person a deviant. most of america is right handed (so it would be considered the norm), left-handed people function different than right handed people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their lives. are left handed people wrong and unnatural as well? no one has determined why people are left-handed, and whether it is caused by genetics or early environmental stimuli. they are deviating from the norm. did you know that the word sinister is derived from the old english meaning 'left handed' due to old beliefs about left-handedness? do you actually (by your previous arguments) believe that left-handedness is wrong? if you don't, then you cannot possibly apply your arguments to homosexuality. if you do, i'm sorry, but you are ignorant.	you mus think you're pretty smart huh? well guess what? you're confusing common, most common, majority, and norm. lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm. you're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. good try though.  also left handed is genetic. it's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics.	sarc

certainly, because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally.to be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....and to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by....	it is worse then that they just don't get it. once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. they just don't get it.	notsarc
i'll trust anybody that's not government funded, with a gun. hell i'd even trust drug dealers sooner than i'd trust the government in terms of being armed. governments all around the world have killed millions of their own people in genocides after disarming them, proving that government should never be armed.	"first off, define ""government funded"". the fbi? the cia? other federal law enforcement agencies? the military? all vital government entities that are and should be armed. the fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government."	notsarc

put a fork in it. socialized medicine is doa.the possible scenarios that could get the healthcare bill made into law are both suicidal moves that will cause the democrats to become washington outsiders in quick order. they are:1. get the hr to pass the senate bill without any changes. this will be suicidal to the most liberal democrats and the most conservative ones, because the senate bill is a neutered version of the house bill.2. they drag their feet on certifying brown until after the reconsiliation process occurs so that they maintain their supermajority. this option is ever worse than option 1 because it exposes every democrat in congress for the unprincipled b@#$%rds that they are and will cause a firestorm against them for years to come. if there's one lesson that crooked politicians should have learned by now, it's the lesson of watergate. the people have long memories when it comes to blatant attempts to throw elections.	so you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate brown and let him stop the bill? you suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.	notsarc

other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree, sure, but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable.	yes peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. what i'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. so your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. can't you see that peeling? none of this is provable.	notsarc

how can family values shift in a nation withint 10 years?? 10 years ago america would have never thought they wouldve needed to put marriage ammendments on the ballot let alone have less than 60% of the people actually vote for it. its sad to see a nation degrade exponentially fast and not to mention the people's consciences getting seared at the same time.its kinda like the germans after slow and steady progress of the nazi party changed the whole nation's perspective on the jews. people that were against the nazi party 5 years prior found themselves turning jews into concentration camps. i see a similar progression beginning in america to the point that this comment itself will be bashed by those on here whose conscience has been seared to the point that they think 2 men being married is ok. if everyone in the world was gay, the human race would become extinct.edit/delete message reply with quote	"so gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? so you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?we are sick of conservative family types. we are tired of the closet. the phrase ""we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more"" applies. i see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. it is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. as it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing."	notsarc

banks have been lending on 5 times salary for mortgages, when 3 is the sensible limit. the size of mortgages is such that even a small rate change will push many over the limit of affordability. consumer spending is already falling.	are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire.	notsarc

i agree, no oath should be taken lightly. however, i believe that a certain amount of interpretation is essential, especially in grey areas that medicine can wander into. abortion to save the life of the mother is a grey area that doctors have to wrestle with. separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area. following an oath such as that to the letter puts things too much in black and white, when a lot of good medicine happens in the shades of grey.	"in the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. what if the siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? and what if one siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. i'm sorry but my doctor is male, so i will no longer use ""his/her"" or ""he/she""... it just gets tiring after a while...)"	notsarc

so why, in this gun-hater's dream come true of congress, did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law?	i don't find it surprising. it's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . they don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. they know that the republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. the republicans learned during the clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in congress. it's all politics.	notsarc

i do understand that, but equally those who are pro-life would doubtless think differently. possibly in the example you gave, but what of a very late pregnancy, one that is not an early fetus and could easily exist if a csarian for example were performed? self-aware too is not necessarily a get-out clause. what of people in deep comas who are arguably not self-aware either? or for that matter a baby, when does ones concept of 'self' actually begin? but it can be argued that the impact on the child's life is significantly greater than that on the parents. existance is after all pretty much the biggest impact on anyone. to be fair i'm playing devil's advocate here really, as i am broadly pro-choice myself. i was just struck by the similarity of the arguments in 'the parents right to choose ends when it affects the child's life'.	...well...in the last decade or so we've been starving them to death. where have you been? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being. i'll grant you that. in the case of your c-section question, i think the mother should have the section, but we can never compell her to do so. it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate.	notsarc

you see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.	pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. however, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.to a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.you do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. you are mixing the two.	notsarc

rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. the life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.the reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.	"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. if you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.

not really. that's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. the problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. in fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.	you know that, i know that, but the creationists do not know that.	notsarc

it has a chance. any scientist has the opportunity to study id. we are discussing the science classroom. we already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. but it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. that's what this debate is over.	today's students are tomorrow's scientists. they are unlikely to study something that, if they hear about it at all, they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution. to reduce id to other classes like literature or social sciences, etc. (where poetry, fiction, and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter) is nothing more than a clever, dishonest attempt to belittle it.	notsarc

"""canada, australia, and new zealand all have many guns (though not nearly as many handguns as does the united states). the key difference is that these countries do a much better job than we do of keeping guns out of the wrong hands. their experience shows that when there are reasonable restrictions, relatively few outlaws can possess or use guns. "" -http://www.vahv.org/nejm-ed.html i am 100% in favor of outlaws not having guns. if you have not noticed, 3 groups of people can not have guns in this country.1) the insane2) criminals3) domestic violence perpsit is currently illegal for outlaws to have guns. passing another law will just make outlaws ""double-lly"" illegal. no more laws are need. enforcement of current laws is what is needed.if law #1 is not enforced, what makes you think law #2 will be enforced?"	well if you're going to quote that article that mentions canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? canada has them. and if the nra is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? the nra uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. robert ricker, former top lawyer of the nra, talks about it. 	notsarc
schumer: ok. now, let me ask you this. when you wrote that statement, you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you had no exceptions. so that would mean, at least in 1985, your view then, there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children, right?alito: senator, it was a general statement that didn't go into -- it didn't...schumer: but it had no exceptions. you didn't make that...alito: it was one sentence, and it certainly didn't represent...schumer: there was no -- you didn't write any exception for that situation. correct? it just said the constitution does not protect. it was without exception. and, yesterday, you didn't argue me when i mentioned that without exception.alito: i don't recall your using the words without exception. schumer: i think i did.(crosstalk)schumer: if you believe...alito: could i just answer that question? it's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject.schumer: no, i understand that. but it was a very strong statement. it didn't talk about any exceptions at all. and the way i read that statement, even if a woman was raped by her father, she'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy. if you believe the constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow, wouldn't it?alito: i think the statement speaks for itself, and it's one sentence and it's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of...schumer: knowing these examples, do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad, unqualified statement, without exception, that the constitution does not protect the right to an abortion? no ands, ifs or buts, is my words.alito: what i actually said was that i was proud of my participation in the thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the thornburg case...schumer: but you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views.alito: that's correct. but what i was talking about there was the thornburg case and nothing more than the thornburg case.schumer: i understand. but you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?alito: well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.schumer: you didn't think that through in 1985?alito: i was not involved in...schumer: when you wrote the statement. when you wrote that statement.alito: and when i wrote the statement what i was saying was that i was proud of what i had done in relation to the thornburg case, which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of, which did not argue that roe should be overruled, did not argue that the government should argue that roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar.schumer: i understand what you wrote, but you also -- we can bring the statement up here, but i don't want to go over the thing of yesterday. i would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement, even from 1985, that the constitution does not protect the right to abortions. not an exception of health of the mother, not an exception of rape or incest, not an exception of any of these others. i didn't see any of those in your job application. but i want to conclude on...alito: senator...schumer: go ahead, please.alito: it was one sentence. and i think what you're saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account.schumer: in all due respect, sir, i think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it, particularly in light of a strong statement before.but we'll have to differ on that.	schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the senate. he failingly tried to draw alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as shumer.it is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.	notsarc

i believe in spinoza's god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a god, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. neither can i believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.a man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. for this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a supernatural being.

why is the choice of religion more worthy of constitutional protection that any other choice.emoticonxconfused	well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as i've stated several times. there are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? that being said i have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. they should be silent on the subject.	notsarc

what is supposed to take thousnds/ millions of years for populations of animals to evolve has just taken a swift punch to the gut by david reznick.	well, yes. eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. the estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by george gaylord simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. more recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. besides the studies that reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the bahamas. these are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.	notsarc

"o.k., lets go through your scenario. the government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed. somehow all americas nuclear arms were obliterated. the invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms. now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up. the five rounds with 200 million guns, works. the population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers, though the price is high in terms of casualties. america is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place.the year is 2004, the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food. but each of the 400 million people has a gun, with lets say 30 rounds each. the population now has 12 billion rounds, and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities, and lets also assume for the hell of it, that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope (just for fun). same situation, same invading force. the population rises up, taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches. lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles, 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun, lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere, and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know.to overthrough the standing american army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes, tanks and naval units. first off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas. where ever the militia units try to form, they are killed by tanks, even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through america who has the greatest tanks in the world, you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the american armed divisions. but, wait. lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population. lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units, lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks, and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect. to defeat the american army of planes you would, again, have to have massive numbers (or technology superior planes). so the population tries shooting down the planes, but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles. but again, wait. somehow, without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force, all planes are spotted (miles away) and shoot down by the untrained militia. the genius military leaders (who no body though to kill) work no doubt. yet still, the population is defeated because if i remember correctly, the militia doesn't have naval units. so even if all the inland forces could be killed, the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force (which is very large because it had to defeat the american navy, the greatest in the world technologically).but lets assume, the population just swims to the invading ships, kills the crews, and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships. thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the american resistance. i am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then america's armies for one simple reason. the only way you could defeat the american icbms is to have a blitzkrieg (i know my spelling sucks) like attack. most of the icbm silos aren't connected to the internet, mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack, so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone.now, you may be wondering what am i trying to say here. well its simple, if somehow, just somehow, the entire military force of the u.s. was obliterated, it would take just one icbm hit on the enemy's capital city to make attack impossible. again, the blitzkrieg like attack? even if that worked the u.s., like russia and a few other nuclear powers, keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over, and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army. so it would never happen that the u.s. would be left nuclear-naked.but lets assume that happened (maybe during a really, really cool party some idiot colonel peed on them, and they just fried). the genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air, ground and sea. you still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the u.s. probably spend several trillion doing it ( i know, that's a pretty low number for the invasion of america), and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles (again lets assume somehow america's own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all america's nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event). the hugest, most glaring problem with the militia, unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop, they would have to gather. and if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in, to order to defeat the large invading army, they would be taken out very easily by 1. icbms launched from enemy subs 2. prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence (remember those satellites) 3. all groups preparing for ""battle"" so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars, ambushes, rockets, infantry rushes, tank columns etc. before they knew what hit them.4. it would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight, and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability, they would still need satellites for the military genius in california to command units in n.y., n.y., and....wait america's satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that, it wouldn't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit (effectively sitting ducks). and any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection. --------------------------------------------------------------------------but militia units only have guns, and they would get their butts whooped, even with massive numbers. what you are saying is only true about napoleonic tactics, in today's modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable no the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking soviet empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the arab world which would not happen with the u.s. because if an enemy can take out the u.s., it could probably take out the combined forces of europe and north america, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland. neither is the french revolution a good-counter point, as i have said, your tactics only work with napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when napoleon the 3rd was in power? (in case you didn't learn it in school, napoleon the 3rd, napoleon's nephew, was in power during the french revolution) trust me, cause the only thing i love more then physics is military tactics and warfare. ----as i have shown in more detail, treat2 is right, it wouldn't work.------the other amendments don't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the u.s.a, they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and ""in fashion"" so long as the u.s. still has human citizens. please opinions only, not baseless assumptions using limited military knowledge, or rebuttals to previous opinions."	"so,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the usa are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?surely any country that tried to overtake the usa would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.and even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?sure,if you dream up some darth vader size invasion,no one stands a chance.but if you put it real world perspective.say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the usa.i would assume ""armed citizens"" would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not."	notsarc

as far as i can see, evolutionists agree that natural selection is how we have evolved for microscopic life forms. to me this means that a single organism in a species mutates, giving it and its offspring an advantage over the rest of the population. if this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?	"in some cases yes, in others no. if the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic ""mutation"" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained."	notsarc

to apathy:call me crazy, but i still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! we had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. the only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. in a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. an example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. we take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. so, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. what did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? dogs (varying in hair sizes). what did we get after a short amount of time? dogs (only the long hair size). there is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. the only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. this is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.so even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total dna content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept? his method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. he is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. this is yet to be determined, however. can you keep us informed of his progress?	also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating nylon. the theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.what it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.it is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. but thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. they are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.	notsarc

i think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? for example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them?especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? the environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.)it makes sense that eagles, hawks and falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. but they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. so why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads?	they have. prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. predator animals have their both eyes facing forward.	notsarc

what about other 'rational' alternatives to your version of evolution; such as that postulated by id theorists?	intelligent design comes in many flavors too.id that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.id that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. however, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. even a simple application of occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. it's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. you can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?	notsarc

"the quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. a quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. the problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the ""quality of life"" test."	the interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. so far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life. 	notsarc

for the teleporter, i agree that you would be dead. i am not trying to argue that 'you' would ever cease to be dead when the new you was created. i believe that you would be dead the moment your body was destroyed, and when it was rebuilt, that would not be you. if two such clones were created, then there would be two clones, but neither would be you. this is why i am saying that who we are is more than our physical selves, indeed the teleporter example seems to prove it, therefore we are also our frame of reference. yes, your brain and your senses change to a degree, but your frame of reference remains that of wraith, which is why you remain you your entire life.	yeah you're saying what it isn't but not saying what it is. i'm not sure what you mean as physical either. can i ask you out straight -- are you suggesting a metaphysical component to 'you'? this questions just, i feel, needs to be answered because i'm still trying to grasp what your saying. to a degree? as soon as it changes you are something else surely? i would be wraith +1 or, after a heavy night out wraith -20 -- the 'wraith' bit is just seemingly a conveniance to show nothing more than perceived lineage -- i'm not the same frame of refference at any given point as i was a second ago. i might as well be called cow +20 after eating, and assimilating a beef burger, the lineage part really is quite meaningless.	notsarc

i'm assuming static because that's the case i'm interested in. in real terms, i'm holding a ball; it's motionless with respect to the earth. i let go. what about warped space makes the ball move towards the earth? that's the specific question that i'm trying to get an answer to. yes, the marble should roll towards the ball regardless of the orientation of the sheet. if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity, but that smacks of a circular definition to me. an analogy for gravity that requires gravity doesn't convince me, or explain anything to me.	so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?	notsarc
evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change	no it doesn't. first, the changes may not be neutral. i will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. even in natural selection there is no purpose. natural selection is differential reproductive success. some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.	notsarc

why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is arab or not? aren't the arab and non-arab created by god? why all this discrimination among the creation of god?eanassir	i think that you missed the point of the argument. vt is arguing that the low birth rate in the west is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the arabs. since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the west, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.	notsarc

for me the reason i don't 'give it credit' is that it's irrelevant--i don't see how it matter either way way if sexual 'orientation' is natural or not. it's a separate issue from the moral one. remember, it's natural for animals to do many things--some species' males impregnate the females and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it's own. but just because such behavior exists among animals doesn't make it moral in humans. in fact i'd call it immoral. there are many such examples in the animal kingdom. natural doesn't mean it's automatically moral.	then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? silly, i 'd say! humans are part of the animal kingdom. mammals if i remember from biology. are you not an animal? if not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon.	sarc

"*note*: this is not for the weak at stomach :*note*just read...dear mommy, i am in heaven now, sitting on jesus' lap. he loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. i so wanted to be your little girl. i don't quite understand what has happened. i was so excited when i began realizing my existance. i was in a dark, yet comfortable place. i saw i had fingers and toes. i was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. i spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. even from my earliest days, i felt a special bonding between you and me. sometimes i heard you crying and i cried with you. sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. i heard daddy yelling back. i was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. i wondered why you cried so much. one day you cried almost all of the day. i hurt for you. i couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. that same day, the most horrible thing happened. a very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place i was in. i was so scared, i began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. maybe you never heard me. the monster got closer and closer as i was screaming and screaming, ""mommy, mommy, help me please; mommy, help me."" complete terror is all i felt. i screamed and screamed until i thought i couldn't anymore. then the monster started ripping my arms off. it hurt so bad; the pain i can never explain. it didn't stop. oh, how i begged it to stop. i screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. though i was in such complete pain, i was dying. i knew i would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. i wanted to make all your tears go away. i had so many plans to make you happy. now i couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. though i was in utter pain and horror, i felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. i wanted more than anything to be your daughter. no use now, for i was dying a painful death. i could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. i wanted to tell you that i love you before i was gone, but i didn't know the words you could understand. and soon, i no longer had the breath to say them; i was dead.i felt myself rising. i was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. i was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. the angel took me to jesus and set me on his lap. he said he loved me, and he was my father. then i was happy. i asked him what the thing was that killed me. he answered, ""abortion. i am sorry, my child; for i know how it feels."" i don't know what abortion is; i guess that's the name of the monster. i'm writing to say that i love you and to tell you how much i wanted to be your little girl. i tried very hard to live. i wanted to live. i had the will, but i couldn't; the monster was too powerful. it sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. it was impossible to live. i just wanted you to know i tried to stay with you. i didn't want to die. also, mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. mommy, i love you and i would hate for you to go through the kind of pain i did. please be careful. love,your baby girlhttp://wajclan.topcities.com/abortion/abortion.html"	confucius, that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured.	sarc

i think they are doing it out of fear. they see the moral decline in america and they have latched onto the glbt community as their scapegoat. since it's no longer pc to attack african-americans for their obvious differences, it's not pc to go after other religions (especially judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.i mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around heterosexual sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. it's easier that way.	i can see what you are saying. it's pretty much true...being a jewish homosexual, i know it first hand. but just for once, couldn't they pick on somebody else?it seems almost like a bully tactic for the christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who doesn't have a legal leg to stand on...that's sad.	notsarc

[i.e. 1970 it was 0.0123% and now it is 0.0124%]. i also remember at university there was a big deal about an aluminum plant in southern california or maybe mexico that was constantly blowing smoke into a particular mountain range that was growing trees. so scientists started studying the ill effects of all this pollution on the trees. does anyone know what was discovered?	erm... we are? levels of co2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million, currently a little over 380ppm, 150 years ago closer to 280. in 1970 about 330ppm.   carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia	notsarc

"actually, ""evolutionism"" does have meaning, but not in biology anymore. biologists stopped using it over 100 years ago. from wikipediasome important concepts (and why the word no longer has meaning in biology) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve. such concepts were discredited with darwin. as is pointed out, opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with ""creationism"". while ""creationism"" is a belief in mythology based on no evidence, no one ""believes"" in evolution. evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution."	exactly, which brings us back to square 1. creationism is based on religion, and evolution is based on the scientific method, but is not proven. creationism isnt even near being proven. so, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?	notsarc

"there's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if i analyze it, it will help make my point;the word ""evolution"" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often does mean. if it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. that's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. so if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. it implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. since evolution can't prove the book of genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.the problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. yet there was a case that i read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an aclu lawsuit ensued. of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. it's what i mean when i say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. the u.s. government is no longer small. do the christians that you know that believe in evolution, believe that there was no first man named adam, or that there was no genesis flood? the term ""evolution"" needs to be narrowed down - more clearly defined, for these discussions."	true, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. i know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. thats what i was trying to imply.	notsarc

"i thought i got to the substance of your argument quite well, and prefer not to drone on with a million quotes. if you want to press your argument further you will need to construct an argument as to why ""putting someone in the position"" obligates you to sustain their life, and when doing so you may want to examine the consequences of that position, to see if you can apply it consistently.you put it theretherefore you are responsible for itisn't, in itself, an argument."	you are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. if i fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, i am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. however, i have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. this makes me responsible for your death.	sarc
after reading the other posts in this thread, i will not agree to a debate without pre-defined definitions either. i'm open to new definitions, but this debate should not be a debate over what atheism or evolution means.	and we all know that is what it will become. i'm willing to bet money that marc is going to argue that abiogenesis is a part of evolution as well as the big bang. there's a clear reason why he won't accept the definitions before the debate starts.	notsarc

you could go there but it won't change the fact i don't agree with your ideas of what is says. you believe it is saying one thing and i believe it says something else. we have an entire supreme court to do the same sort of interpretation game with our constitution. they sit and make decisions and interpreations based on what they think it says. the bible is the same game.	not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls.	sarc

as do you. you seriously want to dictate to others that your opinions are the truth. i'm sure you find a lot of things amusing, given your warped view on things. actually i think that what a lot of the 55-60% of the country who oppose gay marriage find, is that if they join an internet site, that they will be viciously attacked by gay marriage supporters. that's what most of you are really like.  there really isn't much of an anti-gay movement, except a handful of people and a few commercials. your vilification of them is typical of most far left gay marriage supporters.	actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. the supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. ever read john locke or js mill? you should, it's what our country ideals are based on. you have your bubble and i have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs.	notsarc

lol, joe, kinsey was a flake and his analasis had been disproven time and agaim. david and jonathan were not lovers. the bible refers to love in this case as that between brothers and paul's ministry? god called him to be single. nice try, but the target is 8' to the right.	actually, if you count the kinsey 4,5, and 6's you get 18%. it's 10% for the 5s and 6s. that'd be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part. 2,3,and 4 would be those who are bi and lean slightly one way or the other. 0 and 1 are people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same. 0 and 6 are very rare though. anyway, 10% of people are a 5 or 6. about 3% are a full 6.could jesus have been asexual? in certain philosophies asexuality is considered a sign of enlightenment. for instance, after becoming enlightened, the buddha rejected sexual desires.	notsarc

from an enviromental perspective, forest fires are crucial for certain species to survive. man made influences has created a situation where forest fires are too uncommon that certain species and plants are facing extinction. forest fires also serves the purpose of revitalise the forests and make them more 'healthy'. but as i said, this is from the enviromental point of view. you are indeed correct that uncontralable forest fires are hazardous for humans who live nearby (as well as property). as always, a trade-off must be made.	i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.	notsarc
i would like to add, i don't necessarily agree with the health care reform that obama passed, but i will applaud the fact that he actually passed something concerning health care. all the previous presidents since reagan have promised health care and never delivered. they ran on health care, and once elected did nothing . at least obama kept his promise to address the subject. maybe it could have been a better plan, but what we have now is better than the nothing we've had under mostly republicans.. clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver ....	to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion.	sarc

intellegent design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset. it is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model, then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design. when intelligent design first emerged, among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye, the flagellum and blood clotting. all of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion, and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions. these examples are summarized in wikipedia's article irreducible complexity - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia	yes i know, a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute behe's work. from your link;	notsarc

one reptile has a type of third eye, but it isn't for sight nor is it permanent. it is used to absorb vitamin d from the sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult. then it is covered by scales. tuatara fact sheet but the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes? i mean, it didn't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it.now let's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument. they too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement. now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it? are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans? and we all know that humans don't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom. microscopy-uk / micscape - insect insights. insect eyes. honeybee legs.what really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which can't be reasonably or rationally answered, they refuse to even consider them. keep in mind that i have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom, but what i will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies. why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental, social and predatory pressures, hasn't it made more diverse selections where needed, as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads, rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today, just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected?	there is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism. binocular vision works. its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately. the lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d, as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent. it isn't an eye for defending against predators, and it doesn't need one. as for insects, the fact that they've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well. have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately?	notsarc

as i have mentioned many times in these forums, one's personal view of abortion (i.e., whether it should be prohibited or permitted) has nothing whatsoever to do with whether roe v. wade should be overturned. if one supports the rule of law, then they would have to support the statement made by senator mccain. also, given that you don't like his stated position on gay marriage (i.e., that marriage is a state issue), it appears to me that you don't like democracy either.	ah, so i don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that i have to support mccain's statement. are you serious? that sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. i also find it funny that you claim that i don't like democracy when my very post stated that i would be voting for the democrat party. but then, i guess if we don't support bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? get real, phyllis.	sarc
hi ss. causing trouble again? :)the cat experiment you describe cannot, unfortunately, be used to support lamarckian inheritance, because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients, both the parents and the developing cats in the womb. logically, if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it's inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place. as others have pointed out, this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening. had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better, this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring.similarly, if you were denied vitamin c you would develop scurvy. if a pregnant woman was denied vitamin c - well, it hardly bears thinking about, but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it, too, was denied vitamin c.now, if the baby was born with a functional vitamin c synthesising gene, that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes.	well i'm not arguing that this is adaptation...i have never said that.. what i am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like i said earlier toe does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. this is the basic dogma of weismann's barrier. i'm not necessarily calling this evolution....i'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. there is no other way to describe this other than lamarckism. do you disagree that the inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?	notsarc

the concept of a gay family makes me a little uncomforatable, but i can't formulate any logical arguements to support marrige segregation. by default, i am a supporter of gay adoption. any two loving people can bring up a family just fine. as for marrige, it began as a religious institution, but has been ingrained into american society as a cutural union. gay people deserve the right to recognition in front of the world as a couple, as a partnership. spicygirl is more uncomforatable with gay couples than i will ever be, and that will never change. i would bet money she hasn't figured out her sexuality just yet. that aside, there is no logical argument to deny gays rights. if you have one, i would love to hear it.	i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused.	sarc

a very good argument for getting the government out of 'marriage'. let the various religions deal with / define 'marriage' as the wish to believe. the government should only deal with 'civil unions', regardless of the gender of the individuals involved.	shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such.	sarc

this is actually simply a place for intelligence to prevail, and for unsupported ideas to be hacked down like hogs hung from a meat hook. if christianity is a worthy religion, it will stand the test of extreme scrutiny. history will support it and the text inside the bible will always speak the truth about society, and how god wants us to live (assuming there is a god, that he directed the writing of the bible, and that he put in the bible what he wanted his creations to do/how to live their lives).	wow, so you're saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again? great idea! i think you should spread the wealth a little! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews! oh, wait- no that is discrimination!!! you racist! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs.	sarc

but that simply isn't the case. science class is for science, and any school receiving government funding should use it to promote real science, which is thinking. until intelligent design can come up with evidence, as well as any potential advantage to the science community to id, it will be nothing but a religious belief. and religion doesn't belong in the science class any more than politics does. a completely different subject which has it's merit, but not as real science.	it can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. i agree that i haven't shown how id has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but i've shown it's potential advantage to our society. i've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.	notsarc

there are a few fictional works which addressed this possibility and brought up interesting points. one is aldous huxley's book brave new world. in it, people were grown in artificial wombs, not born, and they could be genetically designed. in the book, a high level official of this society mentions to the main character that an experiment had been tried in which all the people made were brilliant, athletic and beautiful - anyway, characteristics that we admire in people (nothing was said about picking their moral character). they ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role. therefore, this society purposely grew humans who were at different levels (some very mentally deficient) to supply a distributions of people who could fit the distribution of roles necessary for society.therefore, on an individual level, i don't have much of a problem with genetic engineering (assuming that we really fully knew what we are doing, which is doubtful since many unforseen side effects could occur). however, on a societal level, it could be very problematic.	well, i didn't really mean to go that far. but i'm talking about problems like that all worked out, thought about previously, and that the problem was worked out. i'm talking more about, what if you could make laborers stronger, scientists smarter, and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.). i don't think of making everyone the same for that reason. i'm just saying, what if there was a way to better society without going overboard? if the problems were worked out, which i'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?	notsarc

the child in the womb feels pain..when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb, the child moves away to not get stuck by the needle. its because it feels pain.. this is after 18 weeks.this is a child in the womb..	the vast majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. when they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. basically what i'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. for an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. 	notsarc

in re: the jefferson claim... it's true that he proposed castration for 'buggery.' but... considering that colonial scientists were as ignorant of sexual orientation as the ancient israelites, it's not surprising they drafted such a draconian punishment for homosexuality. jefferson's suggestion, however, was merciful by comparison. and we also know that, having revised the bible by editing out all the supernatural events (including, especially, the resurrection) and having referred to paul (author of the nt's allegedly anti-homosexual 'clobber' passages) as 'the great coryphaeus... the first corruptor of the doctrines of jesus,' that he would likely have been repelled by with archangel's views, on both god and homosexuality. in fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration.  	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.	notsarc

well let's look at the facts themselves. concealed carry laws are now part of the legal system in 48 out of the 50 states in this country. concealed carry started in florida and worked their way from one state to another over a continuous 20 year period, and not once has a concealed carry law ever been repealed, for any reason.gun control laws, like handgun rationing, mandatory reporting standards, ammunition registries, secondary background checks, trigger lock and storage requirements, etc. are limited in their reach, sticking to only certain states. there's been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country, and there's even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness.if gun control laws worked at controlling crime, and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates, these facts would be reversed.	"and the brady background check has not been repealed either so by your ""logic"" it must be effective."	sarc

"often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women. perhaps this should be posted as a poll but i wonder if this support for ""choice"" remains consistent.do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children? do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of china for example? the woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce china's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?there are also some areas in india where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?"	"well, i can't speak for anyone else, but i support any choice that the woman wants to make. no, i don't support forced abortions anywhere, i don't support what's going on in china and india because they're still taking a choice away from the women.what i don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are only for the choice of abortion. all the prochoicers i know support any choice the woman feels right about making. for example, i was called a hypocrite because i'm prochoice and pregnant. the person said ""you're forcing others to abort while you carry to term."" i have never forced anyone to do anything, nor will i ever. i've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted."	notsarc

because satan is a fallen angel. he had a chance to be with god, but he didn't take it. he could go back to god any time he wanted to, but he doesn't want to. he has free will. god won't take that away, even though he can.	i don't agree with this debate. if preventing the devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by god then why is it that god did prevent the devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? they are both essentially taking the devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. god seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. why would that be?	notsarc

you don't leave a lot of room for disagreement moose. all one must do to get pounced on by you all as a group is to say we disagree with the lifestyle and we are immediately attacked as christianistas/christers/christianists bigots. homophobic haters who want to oppress and destroy you. but none of what you accuse me of being is true which is why it rolls of me like water off a duck. and i realize my truth is hard and painful to receive but it is spoken in love and out of an eternal concern for you. if what i believe is true, and it is; and i really felt about gays as you say i do, then why would i tell you about the good news of salvation in the hope of spending eternity with you ? explain that if you can.	your truth?? your truth???? does it come in singles or in a bundle? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic, that's halfway between theist and atheist, ja? does it cost extra to buy the 'be judgmental and condescending, and you will enter heaven' version, or can i just buy the 'i have so many flaws, but when they are exposed or i'm out of hand, i'll just fall back on jesus, and that makes me perfect and whole' one? nah, i'll be satisfied with 'the truth that i know is truth, not faith. let's just skip the faith process.' that hits the spot!	sarc

"i support legalization of every drug. i'm sure most of you are young and have been fed xxxx like ""marijuana will kill you."" actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. it is impossible. it takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. you know that idiot pothead. he didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. marijuana does not have long term effects on iq. the only side effect is the lazy side effect. the day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. there is no reason why it should remain illegal.i also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. we spend billions each year on the drug war and i can call someone right now and pick up some crack. it is a failure. what we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. flood the schools with actual info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. if we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. there are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. anyone want to fight it? i have proof to back up what i say and also have the effects of each drug."	you're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. if you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. you have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. you're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. we have taxed the xxxx out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time i checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.	notsarc

so with that, it's also pretty easy to imagine that there was no need for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless/vitaminc-less diet. likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin c. so like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin c from the beginning.	well yes, but thats not what defective gulo indicates. if one has external sources of vitamin c, gulo can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin c intake is high enough. an inactive gulo indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin c which is essential to many metabolic processes.	notsarc

the car crash analogy only goes so far. the consequence of a car crash is merely damaged property.  not all unwanted pregnancies are due to unprotected sex or irresponsibility, contraception can fail. humans are sexual beings, they have sex (something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions. the puritan expects everyone to be celibate until marriage. not all people get married. also, unwanted pregnancies also occur within marriage. i totally understand the concept of being responsible, but the consequences of a pregnancy or an unwanted child can be devastating to a woman or a couple. it is naive, simplistic and yes, punitive, to simply conclude that the woman should 'face the consequences.'	sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well.	notsarc

i have had to really change my point of view of how people (male and female) look at life lately, greg. although i can see your pov, i also see a growing defeatist attitude, at least area-wide here. that is one reason i changed my custom user title, which means: life happens live with it. why the despairing attitude? hopelessness, i thinkwhere that comes from i have no idea.	okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes.	notsarc

a newborn baby cannot think mentally like an adult, but does that make him/her a less valuable life? if a woman is raped, and a two year old is raped, is it not an equally bad crime considering the two year old didn't understand what was happening?i have the same view on abortion.	i think you misunderstand my view. i think that a third-term fetus is already sufficiently a person, so i would certainly consider a newborn baby a person. to me, a person is one who has the most basic, rudimentary sense of thought and emotion. a late-term fetus, from my point of view, is no less a person than an einstein. an einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, i would say not.	notsarc

"for obvious reasons we christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion. we have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of buddhists, new agers, or even satanists to meet, because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble. perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the emperor nero used to ignite christians as human torches to light the streets of rome at night. the persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.but in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground. all of these arguments are related, of course. they are an appeal to that part of american society in which judeo-christian values are still deeply rooted. for even in america at the dawning of the 21st century, many people's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the western christendom of our heritage, as do their ideas of tradition, history and an ideal society.we do not, however, argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion. there is desperation in our tone. there is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric, to the point where we even accuse homosexuals (without much proof, i might add) of being child molesters and sexual predators, and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their ""lifestyle.""there are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears, but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy. we feel deeply threatened, for we sense that we are losing the battle. not simply the battle against homosexuals, but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as ""christian america.""at one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from genesis or leviticus before congress or the supreme court and that would be the end of the debate. no more. the consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society. and seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall, we have become politically desperate, and so we lunge at the enemies of christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists."	the other articles on her website are also well worth reading: musings on christianity, homosexuality & the bible	notsarc

i don't know what i think about this. personally, i believed that cain and seth did marry their sisters. i know, sounds like incest, and today that is what it would be.however, you need to remember that there were no exact set of laws at the beginning of the creation. almost all of god's followers were spoken to by him and were given visions and angels to tell them what to do. i don't believe it was considered incest till the law was written abolishing that sort of thing.i'm not sure about him creating other women either, but you could be right. after all, i've found the idea of him creating life on other planets after the creation acceptable (still wondering about the end of the creation where he stopped though) so with that view in mind, i suppose it's possible.	yea i agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. the reason i say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause god gets mad at cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. kinda just says that there are other people out there.	notsarc

don't you dare try and give me a lecture about cherry picking! all you ever do is cherry pick! you come around about once a month, scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun, and you use that single incident as if it's evidence that there's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation. if that's not cherry picking then i don't know what is. as a gun owner i'm also a property owner. or are you denying that guns are property?	i've been posting at least a few times a week. that's a lot more than once a month. i pointed out that the us has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. i think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked. 	notsarc
that would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. it would depend, i think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. forced surgery would not be an option if i had anything to do about it.	what if the surgery for transferring the embryo/fetus would be equal in difficulty, risk, etc. to having an abortion? there would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo/fetus alive. what would be the reasons, in such a case, to keep abortion as an option?	notsarc

let's be honest, it won't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment. the 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us. it may seem like we don't need that now but one day it really might come in handy and people shouldn't forget that. i still think incorporation is a load of bs though...for any amendment. damn you 14th amendment!	it seems to be the reason for crafting this new, individual right against the states. since the original purpose of the second amendment doesn't appear to be needed, there is a new use that is protected.	notsarc
i'm not exactly sure your point with this article. was it merely to show that pro-choice groups exaggerate claims? that they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side? trust me, you have told me nothing new. in fact, i am somewhat amused that you pointed this out, given that pro-life groups are guilty of all this and more. it said: although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . i almost peed myself laughing when i read this. whatever powerful, emotional images you believe pro-choice are guilty of, pro-life groups are many times worse. what is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus'? i have seen pro-life groups holding huge posters outside high-schools, and pro-life groups hold them up in front of clinics. how much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other? the article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of 'abortion is wrong because it's murder!' that pro-life people seem very fond of. this is the exact fallacy the article mentions, using an unproven point (abortion is murder) to hold up an unproven point (abortion is wrong). i point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt, but to say: before pointing fingers, make sure your own house is in order. this entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well. the argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions (per se). as i see it, since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned, the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt (and yes, more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal) than actually solve the problems with society. to ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women.  if you would, chloe, please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions? i'm amazed they managed to eek out numbers, given that not even the cdc has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked. the most compelling evidence i've seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after, corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods. they found little change in the birth rates, indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease. yes, i know pro-choice groups mislead with stats and figures. this is nothing new, but i feel it is dishonest to point this out without acknowledging your own groups shortcomings in the same area.	well sigma, which is more painful??   being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   or   a woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. it has just as much feeling as the mother.	notsarc

fundamental rightsthis relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. in the words of the u.s. declaration of independence, written by thomas jefferson in 1776:we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.more specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. this is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. since they exist independently of government, in jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.	and here our government recognizes:  rule of law: fundamental rights of citizens democracies exist to serve their people	notsarc

"it turns out, the johns hopkins researchers say, that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which, as workhorses of the cell, carry out the very business of life.""what we now know is that in the event of miscoding, the ribosome cuts the bond and aborts the protein-in-progress, end of story,"" says rachel green, a howard hughes medical institute investigator and professor of molecular biology and genetics in the johns hopkins university school of medicine. ""there's no second chance."" previously, green says, molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super-selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process.because a protein's chemical ""shape"" dictates its function, mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells, resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions. working with bacterial ribosomes, green and her team watched them react to lab-induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein-manufacturing process didn't proceed as usual, getting past the error and continuing its ""walk"" along the dna's protein-encoding genetic messages.""we thought that once the mistake was made, it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next,"" green says. ""but instead, we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another, and it's this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash,"" she adds."	so what is being monitored by the ribosome? information. material representations (amino acid sequence vs dna sequence) of information. but, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.	notsarc
"this post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why toe is a sham along with a challenge to any darwinist to prove me wrong.toe is constructed on a fraud premise. this premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. whenever an evolutionist talks about ""evolution"" he's not talking about mere phenotypic change – he's talking about changes in genes. to a darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that ""evolution"" has occurred. a fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered ""evolution."" the only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. this premise, i suggest is a complete and total fraud...and i will explain why now:let's take humans and dogs, for example. when compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. but just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. of course, there are no ""dog genes"" or ""human genes."" but likewise there are no ""tongue genes,"" ""tail genes"" or ""toenail genes."" parts are not translated genes. thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.but it's worse than that.as i said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don't have. but evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! that's why they analyze dna with such scrutiny! but did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...but they've got it backwards! instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. a dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. same with genes.this, of course, spells destructin to toe because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.but scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. they simply won't give up because they've seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.but here's where they're screwing everything up:when you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? if so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? if so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? that's excactly what science is doing with genetics: they've got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) in reality, what's happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).the only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.so there it is. go for it."	so what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?	notsarc

as i have mentioned many times in these forums, one's personal view of abortion (i.e., whether it should be prohibited or permitted) has nothing whatsoever to do with whether roe v. wade should be overturned. if one supports the rule of law, then they would have to support the statement made by senator mccain. also, given that you don't like his stated position on gay marriage (i.e., that marriage is a state issue), it appears to me that you don't like democracy either.	ah, so i don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that i have to support mccain's statement. are you serious? that sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. i also find it funny that you claim that i don't like democracy when my very post stated that i would be voting for the democrat party. but then, i guess if we don't support bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? get real, phyllis.	sarc

you have obviously been told this by a pro-choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his/her defense for abortion. he fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development. hi ryuuichi, if i might defend your doctor for a second, i think i can explain his thinking. he/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs. old might be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate. at that time, when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together, if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children, he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse. see the difference? to make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. in fact, i can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make. think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point, i'm sure. emoticonxangel	"and have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my ""soul mate."" yeah. i'm thinking if they're willing to make me go through that they're not a soul mate at all. >_>"	sarc

the interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. so far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life.	tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.	notsarc

"some people attempt to explain unknown causes in nature by god's direct intervention. this has been called, ""the god of the gaps."" while god could certainly intervene in the natural process (called a miracle), to make god responsible for common natural phenomena means that as each scientific discovery finds a natural explanation of what was previously attributed to god, the direct intervention of god becomes unnecessary. that is, as the gaps in knowledge become smaller, the god of these gaps becomes correspondingly smaller. people with this mentality see science as a threat to their faith. obviously, were such a view held by the founders of modern science, there would have been no incentive to find answers to the natural phenomena. understanding these natural phenomena as secondary causes, places god above them where increased ability to explain how they occur not only does not ""decrease"" god, but adds wonder to his creation."" http://www.leaderu.com/offices/o_hel...dor_faith.html"	"and depending on what human is ""finding the answers"" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central biblical teachings."	notsarc

"read these storys of self defence and then tell me brady how you can justify thesethe injustice of the british ban on self defensemaking matters worse, the british legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them. an example is the tony martin case:tony martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. when a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. the 16-year-old burglar fred barras was killed, and 33-year-old brendon fearon was wounded in the leg. later on that day, the police arrested tony martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. at trial, martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. the surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued tony martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. the parole board refused to grant tony martin an early release because he ""has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars."" martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the uk for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.another example, from 2009, also shows how the british legal system favors criminals over their victims:a millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home – while the criminal went free. munir hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve ""civilised society"". but walid salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. he was one of three men who ambushed mr hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in high wycombe, bucks, on sept 3 last year after attending ramadan prayers at their local mosque, reading crown court heard. their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. but when hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . the brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in september. sentencing, judge john reddihough told them it was his ""public duty"" to jailing munir hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.this one is quite nice as wellcleared: builder who chopped off thug's ear with samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | mail onlinewell thank god for the gun ban in england. it has completely wiped out all crime meaning no citizen ever needs to defend themself."	when the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim, and this is viewed as being civilized, a society is doomed.	notsarc

the enumeration in the constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. rights retained by the peopleaside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the house of representatives. ''it has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the general government, and were consequently insecure. this is one of the most plausible arguments i have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, i conceive, that it may be guarded against. i have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 it is clear from its text and from madison's statement that the amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a bill of rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 recently, however, the amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.	the purpose of the bill of rights.  preamble to the bill of rights	notsarc
it may help to look at election in this way (wow, i almost wrote evolution emoticonxic)... god is deserving of all glory. in fact, because god is ultimate perfection, he seeks to glorify himself. because humans are not god, we are not deserving of his glory. in order for god to demonstrate his glory, through his characteristic of justice, he allows us to go to hell. however, another characteristic of his glory is that he is merciful. in his mercy he chooses some to be saved and with him in heaven. thus two of his characteristics are being glorified (mercy and justice).	and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant.	notsarc

the reason the dems wimp out is because the gun nuts votes are likely to be swayed by a candidate's position on gun control, whereas non gun nuts, while having an opinion, are most likely concerned about other issues. it is the same reason people don't tend to come out loudly pro-choice, even though the majority of the us population are pro-choice.	well said. most americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. this is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. there probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but i'm not sure how much this will change things.	notsarc

<buzz>wrong, it's the conduct of both parties that need to be reigned in. and that starts with good parenting. for example, when you have a healthy marriage, children will generally model themselves after their parents (disclaimer note i said 'generally' there are exceptions, however disclaimer).	why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent.	notsarc
are you seriously claiming all christians believe this? even when i was a christian, i didn't believe all that. virgin mary? you gotta be kidding me. even as a catholic, that didn't make any sense. this creed strains credulity to the utmost, and i suspect you'll find lots of christians who don't accept it literally.	i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.	notsarc

next they've trashed god's creation by diverting everyone's attention. it's a subtle move that not many people have noticed. but i've noticed. what they've done is a clever sleight-of-hand move. science no longer looks at animals. they no longer study how organisms interact within their environments. instead they've turned everyone's attention to genes, bacteria and viruses….and this is because they know full-well that most people know nothing about these things….thus, they assume (correctly, unfortunately) that most people will just take their word for it.	the concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. my brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. it is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. the simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. a similar turn has occured in chemistry. i could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. all the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. the reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. i myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. it doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.	notsarc

there is nothing about the theory of evolution that precludes a god. that fabricated idea is absurd. there is nothing about the theory of relativity, nor the theory of gravity, nor the theory that the earth is round that precludes the existence of a creator god. in reality, god may or may not exist. some people believe god exists. others do not believe god exists. neither view can be proven based on physical evidence. both are beliefs only. though one of those beliefs must necessarily be true.	i did not say that evolution precludes god, all i am saying is that many atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no god. if a person does not beleive in god, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality.	notsarc

i agree, there is no place for religion in the world today. but would you say that there is place for faith? i find that atheists often (not always) lack the ability to trust, making it difficult to have faith, even if it is just to have faith in the human capacity to redeem itself once is a while.	it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about. do you mean 'having faith' in actual things? if so, then most definately. although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place, it can also be a fantastic one, and seeing that (as i'm an athiest) gives me some kind of 'faith' in the human capacity, society, etc (where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god).	notsarc

for this to be a consistent pro-choice argument, and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 14th amendment there would be necessary conclusions. those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman's right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life. therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).	"that is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. by contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. i would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty."	notsarc

"mexico city – guards and officials at a prison in northern mexico allegedly let inmates out, lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings, including the massacre of 17 people last week, prosecutors said sunday.after carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells, the attorney general's office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption.""according to witnesses, the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards' weapons for executions,"" office spokesman ricardo najera said at a news conference.the director of the prison in gomez palacio in durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation. no charges have yet been filed.prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings, including the july 18 attack on a party in the city of torreon, which is near gomez palacio. in that incident, gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall, killing 17 people, including women.police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene, and najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison.similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in torreon, the capital of northern coahuila state, he said. at least 16 people were killed in those attacks on feb. 1 and may 15, local media reported.najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels. ""unfortunately, the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians, only to return to their cells,"" he said.coahuila and neighboring durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the gulf cartel and its former enforcers, known as the zetas.mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes, catching criminals and convicting people. reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in mexico result in prison sentences. but sunday's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes.interior secretary francisco blake said the revelation ""can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address, once again, the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again.""also sunday, mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of ciudad juarez, across from el paso, texas.police described luis vazquez barragan, 39, as a top member of la linea gang, the enforcement arm of the juarez cartel, saying he received orders directly from cartel boss vicente carrillo fuentes.vazquez barragan allegedly organized payments, moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around ciudad juarez.police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader juan pablo ledezma, though vazquez barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the attorney general's office, as ledezma is.la linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people july 15 in ciudad juarez and for two separate shootings march 13 that killed a u.s. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate.police did not say when they caught vazquez barragan, but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram (pound) of cocaine and two guns.his arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim.also sunday, the attorney general's office said soldiers on patrol in ciudad madero in the border state of tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns, 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house.elsewhere in tamaulipas, police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned petroleos mexicanos. nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized.mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from mexico's pipelines.in the pacific coast state of guerrero, authorities reported sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations, including three in or around the resort of acapulco. two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month."	so somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that america still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of mexico.	sarc

when placed on the ballot instead of being rammed down the public's throats by activist courts and out-of-touch legislators, gay marriage has a zero - 31 record. the fact is that the public, when it exercises its constitutional right to decide via the ballot box, has decided against gay marriage every time.gays can't blame the christian right and the mormons for spending $millions on this one. in fact, gays spent a ton on this one....and it didn't matter.	and if the majority supported banning christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.	sarc
that's information to you, not to the organism. if someone says the mountain will not get higher on it's own, and you go and dump dirt on it; you have not disproven them. by information they mean that records anything useful for the organism, including specific functions. now the average anti-evolutionist would like it to be just specific functions in which case you could just say novelty (information on how to create new systems). dna records useful data (information) for other things, it records modifications of existing systems to adapt to the environment. deletions of detrimental code is also information, although the net change is a loss. as for my previous arguments, they have been that there is no known law, physics, or calculation that would cause the construction of an novel system; leaving only probability.	that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!	sarc

(a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.	notsarc
but why does this generation get to bypass the same authority that every other generation before them submitted to with their parental oversight ? how is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ? are you suggesting that 13 year old girls are mature enough emotionally to make such adult decisions about getting an abortion ? and if so, do you then also believe that a 13-15 year olds should be allowed to adopt a child ? or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? because those are also adult decisions and it doesn't seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decisions about sex or abortions and then insist they're not mature enough to participate in other adult decisions. kids need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adults and by your way of thinking, you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life.	yes, because its their decision, its their stomachs, and its their lives. i agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   irrelevant. how does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? what if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? you would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. the decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.	notsarc
of those that are beneficial, the chance of actually being passed on is minimal considering the animal bearing that mutation has to actually be the biggest strongest animal to pass on its genes - unless it is lucky.	no it doesn't. that's why darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. fittness is not a reference to big and strong. it makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.i'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. natural selection is differential reproductive success. those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.you've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong.	notsarc

did you watch the video? this is not about liberals vs. conservatives. the argument is that a childs success is not by any means proportional to the sexual orientation of its parents. mr. wahls is an example of that. good parenting and luck is what's needed to instigate success in a child. you seem to insinuate that is done only by 'liberals' (man, i hate that term). this is simply rhetorical analysis 101. pathos to be exact. you appeal to a persons emotions. it's a marketing ploy used by advertisers and politicians and is not particular to the left. i assume you're describing the up your alley sections of that website which is hardly representative of the entire homosexual community.	so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it.	notsarc
currently, in the u.s., when you buy a gun, you don't get it right away. it has to be registered and if you pass a sanity check, they'll approve it. it is because of this registration process that illegal guns are brought into the country and sold..., illegally. if you ban guns, this black market will flourish and the number of unregistered guns will increase. the crazies that want to shoot up a bunch of people will still be able to get a gun. i prefer regulation over making things illegal and banning them. i also prefer freedom over safety. but hey..., that's just me..., well..., me and a bunch of crazed, gun packing, red blooded americans ;)	oh yeah you're right! i suppose only sane americans get guns! no wonder 0% of the population are killed in gun warfare. oh wait, a considerable amount of people are killed by guns. silly me! of course all the sane people can also shoot who they want in some states, just because they feel threatened by it. sure keep guns, advocate them why don't you. after all, all those people killed, and the families of those people.. hasn't happened to you, so why should you care?!?!

oh, and btw, cooperative mechanisms of evolution are perfectly compatible with darwinian mechanisms. it's still a matter of determining which genomes survive into the next generation, and if genes that have 'learned' how to cooperate are better survivors than those that compete too aggressively, then darwinian theory predicts they should increase their frequency in the population. biologists have used game theory extensively to model how balances between cooperation and competition can be maintained in a genetic population. but what we get from this sort of perspective is not a refutation of darwinian thinking, but a more complete perspective.	so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?	sarc

this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musings so i will take up one point. respect for your mother and father is only relevant in a society where the nuclear family is the norm. there have been some societies where this was not the norm. im afraid to say this demonstrates another example of someone that believes the world is and always was as he lives it . respect( or fear) is necessary for a functioning society but not necessarily towards parents..which is exactly what the commandment orders.	sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments.	sarc
is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?	"yes. it describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. that is why 'selection' is always teleological. in order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. there must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. the only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. but since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. in the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. but 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. so 'selection' is always teleological."	notsarc

i could care less if i shower with a lesbian. i am sure i have at the gym. one of my olderst friends is a lesbian and we have seen each other naked many times. she has never gawked or hit on me. she knows i am straight. i have been hit on by women and men i am not interested in. i say 'thanks, but no thanks.' i have only ever had one lesbian contnue after that, the number of men that wouldn't let it rest are beyond count. but overall, i think women have a lot more tact in such matters. as to the whole naked thing. we are so puritanical about nudity in the us. when i spent a month in finland i saw people of all sizes, ages, colors and genders naked all the time due to the saunas and jumping into lakes. it was in no way sexual. as far as separating men and women's showers i mostly see that as a safety issue for women. sexual assualt is a very real danger for women (1 in 3 will experience it in her lifetime). although i believe most men are not rapists, especially those in uniform, having men and women shower together has the potential of putting women in a very vulnerable situation as most men are physically stronger than most women.  i don't believe this. i am as worried about it as i am that stepping on a crack will break my mother's back. stop fretting. gay men probably find homophobes about as appealing a black woman would find a memeber of the kkk. hell, i am a straight woman and find your ignorance and paranioa of the matter decidedly unattractive.  neo-con, religious wing nuts. they are so entertaining.	i'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??  for the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. so keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does.	sarc
when have liberals ever been upset and outraged over a criminal being given a deal? who do you think if offering them up?	prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator.	notsarc

i don't know if you read the last part of my post, but i'll repeat it more clearly. a baby is always reliant and demanding of another person's care. a baby outside of the womb still depends on its mother (or somebody at least) to consistently keep him fed, to help him sleep and to change his diapers. a baby can stay alive for a bare minimum of time outside the womb, but it still needs care. viable may not be the right word for you. maybe i should say as 'genuine' a baby as the newborn. and you're correct when you said: ''the probability is progressively less with each fewer number of weeks.' but that only makes sense when the womb is empty. when the womb is occupied, it is occupied with a living functioning baby.	functioning? the fetus breathes freely? it cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? it demands attention? it smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  wow! didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.	sarc

i reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason. it is untrue and cannot be proven. darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils. there have been no such fossils ever found.that being the case, even darwin agrees that the theory of evolution is just man's folly. ya'll can write millions of words about evolution, but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils the fact of the matter is that god created man in his own image. case closed.	hunter, would you be interested in actually discussing this logically? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertions and run away when challenged? if your view is the truth, then you have no reason to run.	sarc

one other point: say that the laws of physics (which are derived from mutual human experience) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes. if these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time, then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment? it all comes down to probability - if things are not what we expect they are from science, then that should have manifested itself by now.	i'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever. i'm not sure where you derive 'probability' from, or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses.and in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.	notsarc

a few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors. apparently there is a planned parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti-abortion protestors were there the other day. i didn't know that before then. i wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so i asked them. one woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion. i didn't think of it at the time, but planned parenthood does a lot more than abortion services. i wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well. if this were the case, the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal. they potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use. in turn, this might increase the chances of an abortion. i wonder if anti-abortion folks ever consider that?	the goal of anti-abortionist is clear. the job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.	notsarc

"as theorized, the concept of evolution is analogous to slow morphing, rather than quick abrupt changes in a species. morphing!, as can be done with computer graphics programs designed by intelligent beings. evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change -- but morphing is accomplished by unintelligent random processes, or at least that's how the story goes -- the created universe and life were random events. i have been patiently waiting for many years but to date have never seen or heard of any species morphing into another species. i am aware of genetic defects that limit species but unaware of mutations that perpetuate new species. clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed, such as poodles and great danes, but they remain members of the same species.mankind has thousands of years of written history and i am unaware of anyone observing species morphation(is that a word?). although it is approaching 200 years after darwin hypothesised how species might have originated, we are no closer to observing a species morphing than darwin. humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these ""new"" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves. besides observing it, the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species, but alas, then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species. hmm, wonder what intelligent being(s) created us?"	i would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then. that is a new species, and it is not man doing it, but rather nature itself.	notsarc

"another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...""finally, mr cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. new evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. k. kato, et al., ?a plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: nucleotide sequence analysis of poad2?, microbiology (reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] in fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. this suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria."" ""all that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. this may seem surprising? how would a loss of information create a new ability? answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. if this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. to put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asptalkorigins gave their usual doubletalk""whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""why do they say this? because it's still a bacteria. it's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. but it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. one site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmone poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..."" in order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.the bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. two distinct advantagesbut, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. three disadvantages.so by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain? if nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""http://www.christianforums.com/t52336"	"none of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. they all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about ""information"" or something."	notsarc

keep in mind two important points:1. reason does not imply truth, it's a method of seperating truth from what is false, and you can quite easily (and do every day), reason something to a false conclusion. 2. you can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason.	"if information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? how do you know what is false and what is ""true""? if we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. if your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. you can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.as for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator. references:* the creationist basis for modern science.* the lie: evolution ~ ken ham.* evolution: fact or fiction? ~ john blanchard."	notsarc

no benefits for laid-off religious workers - upi.com another example of religion getting special perks that they shouldn't have. and unfortunately, somebody else gets bit in the end. i find it difficult to believe that the religious organizations didn't realize they weren't paying unemployment tax. emoticonxrolleyes when they were busy not paying taxes, did they think that was a tax that they were somehow paying? it sounds like at least some religious organizations recognize the impact of their not paying taxes upon others, and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employers do right by their employees (e.g. catholic diocese of richmond). these people shouldn't have to needlessly suffer such an unexpected financial loss, but in the end it's the church that is to blame. they have been enjoying a benefit in not having to pay this tax, and now it's somebody else who suffers...	i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.	notsarc

that just shows how nutty it is. using your argument, someone could reject all scientific theories because most of them are wrong: apparently even yec are in this sense more rational than dawkins. the claim that faith is accepted mainly because people are told to is very dodgy. religion seems to naturally arise, although there are many theories as to how and why, religious and otherwise. think of religion like morality: the idea varies, but seems to exist everywhere and often seems to appeal to the same things. it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs.	daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation.	notsarc

those who don't have god as their moral compass are the ones who are responsible for 99% of crimes committed to humanity. what are you talking about? except for communists i can't think of any crimes committed by atheists. as for crimes committed by people who believe in god? pick a war...seriously, pick any war before communism came about and most wars after it and you'll see that in every case the leader of that nation and nearly the entire population of that nation believes in god. honestly you may deserve a prize for having created the most demonstrably wrong statements on this site. congrats!	wow. just because people believe in god or claim so does not mean they have or use god as their moral compass. the god, i assume we are talking about the christian god, does not promote war and if we are to actualy follow what this god teaches and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war, but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war.	notsarc

you seem to be ignoring a whole bunch of passages that reduce that.and, it's amazing how you have to go everyplace but genesis to resolve your difficulty. you have not dealt with the actual words of genesis.that those passages that define 'yom' as an morning and and evening.	already busted, mr. trebor. went in one eye and out the other. come back when you have something other than generalized rhetoric.	sarc
characters like our jyosh just want to diminish gays in society, and deny that gays are victims of religious homophobia. this is why he pretends that bullying of gay kids is just a feature of bullying in general (as if blue-eyed kids were routinely bullied because of their eye colour!), rather than a direct consequence of religious bigotry. he can't bring himself to admit the truth there.	as we've seen in recent years, kids who are bullied can become so anti-social that they become violent, and attack those who've bullied them with weapons and mass murders. i'm not condoning this behavior, but i'm not surprised that it happens. those who support the bullying of gay kids and others...well, you get what you sow.	notsarc
in reality, there are no concrete 'reasons' for believing in god. if you believe in god, you believe based on faith. there is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that god exists... unless you first believe through faith that god exists.	this statement is wrong. people from hundreds of years before jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in bethlehem, of a virgin. there were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...he completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. these men were inspired by jesus, god, how can you argue that he is not the christ? the odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. and these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! thats proof for me that jesus existed and that he is god. pm me if you like.	notsarc
at the risk of sounding like a hippie, 'make love, not war' also, i think that little feud that's going on between the two countries, is far past solving anything and is little more than a pointless grudge now.	oh, usa is a fiiiiiiiiine one to tell 'make love, not war.' to our fantastic nation!	sarc
third, do you believe the fetus is a human? why? let me be very clear on this term. by the term human i simply mean it is a member of the human species.	having human dna does not necessarily make one a human being. transgenic animals can have human dna, does that make them human beings.	notsarc
we are all entitled to self-defense, but not all that is legal or moral is advisable. i am not against gun rights, or for the mad-regulators of the left; but if i were zimmerman right now (assuming he is telling the truth) i would be kicking myself now until the day i die for not carrying pepper spray and trying that first. for investigating further when the police told me to keep my distance. for not telling martin i had a gun and i was willing to use it before he got close enough to knock me down. i agree there is plenty of possible damning evidence either way. one piece that would change everything is if zimmerman threw the first punch; in which case trayvon would be defending himself and maybe zimmerman shot him because he was losing. that would not contradict known facts.	freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition. what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who's got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york?	notsarc
considering you left-wingers have been wearing out lawyers for the last 100 years trying to get all the vestiges of christianity erased from our halls of government, our history books, etc., america must have been more of a christian nation than you will ever admit.	no easyridden.. it's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution. america is a nation which has always had a population of christians, but it was never a christian nation. the words god, jebus, holy spirit.. are not included in any of the founding documents. you can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon.	sarc
oh, and yes that is where i got that information, and took it directly from their web page.	and the point was, benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. if you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. if it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. if it is a web page, then the url should be given.even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. generally aig is really bad science and isn't very interesting. it is misleading, intentionally. however, on these boards are familiar with their stuff.	notsarc

like you say, it depends on how you define best...furthermore, a destruction caused by limiting freedom takes some time. these countries haven't been around that long remember (in terms of the type of government).	ah, historical inevitability. i had no idea you were a marxist, steeeeve! unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism. and once again you conflate capitalism and freedom. have you never heard of anarcho-syndicalism? and why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government?	sarc
we went to the parade downtown first off, which was actually pretty good for here. after that, we hung out at home for a few hours and then headed up to a friend's cabin at eklutna for a mexican fiesta and some fireworks, fireworks that didn't start until 1:00 in the morning, but they were pretty cool for a private fireworks show. fun day!	first off, i love how you celebrated america's birthday in alaska with mexican food. lol. also, why 1am? what time does the sun set there? i know it's late, but how late? i went to holland in june 2003 and the sun was up well after 10. it was amazing.	notsarc

then explain to me why a pregnant woman was hit by a car not long ago leading to the death of both mother and baby. resulting in a double vehicular homicide charge being leveled against the driver ? how can that be if the unborn child doesn't have rights as a human being ? and why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ? isn't that a true catch 22 for the unborn, and a contradiction in the law ?	because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. as to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. on the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman and obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - without the consent of the woman. in other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.and yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have at her choice and un-coerced have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. but that would of course be much different.	notsarc

sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. it is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.see other times i have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).	you should really think about what you say before you say it. i have heard this before and its garbish, i have been around and owned guns my whole life and i have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. i would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.	sarc
imo, your third degree about 'freeing willy' throughout this thread qualifies as the former. of what concern of yours is it that dono or anybody else for that matter was circumsized, circumsized their kids or believes in circumsism? i was circumsized, my son was circumsized, he'll probably have his son circumsized. i can guarantee you that no generation of my clan will ever mourn the loss of their excess foreskin. as far as we're concerned, it's dead weight, excess baggage. all it does is hide the purple helmet. emoticonxbanghead	third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking.	notsarc
lumped in with everyone else in these 'exchanges'. in any event, anything is more expensive than nothing.	but aren't the exchanges primarily aimed at those who can't get insurance otherwise? i would have thought that if insurance was so little used by young people, insurers would be keen to get their business, and premiums would be low. maybe insurance is more necessary for young people than you think?	notsarc
"it doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of ""survival of the fittest"" which darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to ""natural selection"")."	"as was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. it is a statistical tendency. individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. that's as close as it gets to ""purpose."" and as you know, darwin's favored term was natural selection. he never used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without also making a reference to natural selection. the opposite is not the case. since darwin's time ""survival of the fittest"" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."	notsarc

i'm only rabidly against something so obviously untrue as that of mainstream religion. my argument is that the only reason it is mainstream is that we continually perpetuate it by indoctrinating our kids with it. do you honestly believe you would have found whatever religion you prescribe to if you had not been persuaded to from an early age? why didn't you pick islam? the only difference in christianity and islam in my mind is that islam happens to be the religion of poor states that have been oppressed by empire states. if christianity was the religion in the middle east and northern africa and the west was islamic, you would probably see suicide bombing christians. i expect i will likely get another roflmao out of you for saying this, but it is probably true.  the only difference between islam and christianity is demographic.	reckon you don't know much about christianity then.  when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about. until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air.	notsarc
you flaming liberals are really something else. at least we're generous with our own money. you radicals help the poor using other people's money. then you keep them on your government plantation so they can vote to keep you in power. sieg heil!!	you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.	sarc

"yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of ""creation science"" and of id. their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. scientists have claimed all along that creationists/iders are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. that is the problem. they never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.but now we have ray admitting that creationism and id are not science and can't be included in science. they either philosophy or theology, but not science."	notsarc

quite right. the former nytimers and cnners are all familiar with this particular poster's distractions, fallacies, sockpuppets and 'i'm really pro-gay' shtick. he's been doing it for almost a decade now, and none of us are fooled. i hoped a direct challenge would show that--one riposte to aa aside (an attempt at camouflage, no doubt)--the leopard doesn't change his spots. mission accomplished.	well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll.	sarc
don't be silly--no one is voting your family out of existence. though it might make a fascinating criss angel or david blane trick. this is simply about whether or not any group that wants to come along and redefine marriage should get to do so. i agree it's not an 'academic exercise', but not for the same reason you think.i no more take 'pleasure and joy' from something like this than any other public act of due process, e.g. voting to change the speed limit.frankly, i've always thought it was pretty odd--if not downright disturbing--that some gay pride proponents seem to hold up the legality of their union as the determinant of their joy and emotion, when they are completely free to have whatever union they want regardless. after all, no one's going to block the door to the chapel, and i can guarantee you i'd be joyfully married with or without that piece of paper called a license.	you jsut don't get it. you act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. you as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but i do not. what part of that do you not understand. you say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man i love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. how cruel can you be	sarc

i was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion. liberals don't give a damn about individual freedom; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life. they want gov't control of healthcare because they think we're too dumb to fend for ourselves. they want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they don't trust parents to be parents. the list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless.	that is just conservative bias. conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. conservatives like classes and don't like change. a pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. the last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. with both sides taking the country to extremes. conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. those laws are in place for a reason. liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. there was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.	notsarc
i, as a creationist, do not believe in any of the five evolutionary theories: cosmic evolution: the origin of time, space, and matter, i.e. the big bang chemical evolution: the origin of higher elements from hydrogen stellar and planetary evolution: origin of stars and planets organic evolution: the origin of life macro-evolution: changing from one kind of animal into another there is a sixth evolutionary theory, but it has been proved in a controlled environment, and it is called micro-evolution (variations within kinds)	well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.   careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb!   you mean that the planets and stars have always existed? really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the hubble telescope.   so you don't believe that life had an origin! wow so you think its always been present on the earth? not even the bible goes that far! and you fail to account for the observation that there is life.   thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and most creationists use the kinds thing as a support for their arguments.	sarc
i went about this wrong. i am meaning that it would take millions of years for wings to evolve. during these millions of years, they will be undeveloped, simply masses attached to the dinosaur, and totally useless. when they reach their fully evolved form, they may have been of use, but until then, they could serve no purpose, and help the dino in no way at all, serving only as excess weight, and larger profile, hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement. during the actual period of the wings evolution, they would be totally useless.	"and yet this is what they fossil record shows. there is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.half a feather might not be as good for flight as a ""fully developed"" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. to say they were ""totally useless"", is simply false. evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions."	notsarc

what i am is someone who appreciates the value of the scientific methodology, and its repeatedly demonstrated power to yield elegant, testable, useful and predictive hypotheses, including - over the past centuries - the discovery and modeling of novel forces at work in nature as well as the theory of evolution.	**here you reveal exactly what i've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. it most certainly is not. nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. equally untrue.both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, rmns darwinism.	notsarc

"any novel change/mutation in ""expression"" at the organismic level that cannot be directly linked to a novel genetic mutation can only be eam, aka devo-evo, (that is, developmental evolution), a neo-lamarkian phenomenon. why? because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, ""toe"", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- ""random genetic mutation"", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that ""natural selection"" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring. and there simply is no genetic mutation here. what it does show, empirically, are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals, but by the organism's usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage."	i will stop quoting here. don't want people to have too big a read. actually toe isn't all that random. to a certain degree yes. but sexual selection aka a part of the toe. dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. that change will be enhanced almost exponentially. because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. and the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. so no instant eyes or anything like that. i think that's what you were implying. sorry for responding in kronus's stead. i'm sure he can defend himself but i found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.	notsarc

'prostitution is not a victimless crime as there are child prostitutes, and the human trafficking among other things.' the reason human trafficking if prevelent in prostitution is exactly because it is illegal. if you legalised prostitution, supply of (and demand for) native prostitutes will rise dramatically. do you not see that trafficking and child prostitution would actually be lowered by legalising prostitution? 'legalization of prostitution would lead only to ... a further spread of hiv/aids.' again, do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised? the majority of problems with prostitution are directly attributed to their illegal status.	oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.	notsarc

"i would disagree here about this, in terms of the pro-life view. it's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary; in fact it's the reality that there will soon be mental existence that makes it matter. i don't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone's standards. so i suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more ""in the moment"" in terms of the way they view the fetus, and pro-lifers are more ""long-term bigger-picture"" in terms of the way they view the fetus. certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human."	but growth is fairly irrelevant. my sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. it just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right now. not what it was or could possibly be.that seems reasonable to me.[/quote]	notsarc

i wasn't oversimplifying anything, only stating the obvious in that a whack job intent on murdering people can do it very effectively without a gun. but by disarming honest people as you would do, you insure that criminals who have no respect for the law will remain the only people armed in our society once the law abiding people willingly give theirs up. that will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can't prevent crime from occurring as it's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings.you anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men. if you look at the rates of violent crimes in nations with stricter gun laws you will see that on a per capita basis violent crimes are just as high as they are here. it's just that more people die from stabbings and beatings than do here. but when all is said and done, dead is dead is dead. emoticonxbanghead	i'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. with guns criminals can do even more damage. adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. if you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the us then you need to do more research.	notsarc

more stupidity. neither your site nor vor substance free posts proves that 99% of abortions are 'murder.' besides, that is a subjective term. applying a subjective term and then using it to declare a fact instantly invalides such a claim. it is merely a opinion. besides, what is 'extreme?' my point still stands.  so now you're telling me where i shouldn't be? emoticonxrolleyes	yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones).	notsarc

i'd say a restraint fiscally would naturally cause better foreign relations. hard to make people happy when you attack other countries causing you to spend well into debt thus lowering your economy and bringing other economies with it. and another thing, if i hear just a few more 'i'm more like reagan than you are' then i might have to buy a new tv and explain to the police why my old one is blown to bits in the neighbors yard :)	i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost.	notsarc

i have posted this before, but i will post it again to filter out the digressive posts of the anti-gun people... i guess they were hoping to change the subject to something they could debate, but it didn't seem to work, now did it?statistically, tobacco kills nine times as many people as all homicides and gun accidents combined, and alcohol kills almost twice as many as die in gun-related deaths. (src)even if you count suicides (assuming every single one of them was with a gun, which they weren't), alcohol still kills more people. so, if your intention is to save lives, then why don't you ban this stuff? could it have something to do with the fact that you enjoy alcohol and tobacco?	it's a lot easier to kill someone with a gun than a cigarette or a beer.	sarc

i have had some experience with this topic... my father was murdered when i was 12, the perp was convicted a year later and was charged with 1st degree murder and sentenced to death.. flash forward 24 years he ran his course of appeals and every legal proceeding you can imagine. his lawyer after 20 years of him being on death row came up with 'retardation' mind you he 'walked' 3 times.. all of which i was there to witness. i was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on. anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution. back to the drawing table.. last year after several hearings, they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded..scoring a 75 on his iq test. the limit for the death penalty is 70. he was a high school graduate, had a family, held jobs.. and clearly competent, nonetheless they found him otherwise. so now he is off death row, and the da has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually. with all that it has been a very trying time for me and i have had to struggle with how i really felt about the death penalty. i have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction. i do not know if it is out of revenge or not, hard to say i am too close to the matter. but i did feel let down when they took him off death row, now i feel like there will never be justice. i put so many years of waiting for that moment... it sounds kind of sick, but as much as i dreaded witnessing it, i also looked forward to it. i do think that maybe life in prison may be better, only if his experience there is just awful.... but the revenge side of me, just wants him to suffer what my father suffered. but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way, which would be i should be the one to flip the switch .. not so sure i could do it. so with all that i still don't really know if i in my heart, support the death penalty or i am just after revenge. the victims of violence i would imagine go through this struggle. side note... the man who murdered my father also killed a young girl when he was a minor... he had escaped from the correctional facility he was in.. and it was several years later when he killed my dad.	so sorry, anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. and now, using that excuse? what!   if justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.   there are some who need to be put to death.   your situation made me shudder, anastasia. but, i am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   if it would have been my father, those many years ago, i cannot say that i would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. i could very well be in prison myself.	notsarc

no, because 2+2= 4 if you agree with it or not.it's a concept that is not dependent on man to agree with it.	that's exactly the point. regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. we know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. this goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.imho, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.	notsarc

"i wasn't thinking the term 'micro-evolution' but that does work.my point was that the idea of evolution is a gradual change over a long period of time.

"it is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. the morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. the difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. ""macro"" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. you have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different."	notsarc

so far there is no mechanism for an organism to grow wings when it previously had none.	i know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. birds didn't just grow wings. wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. you see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.	sarc

i think your question should be 'why did god make commandments?' because that's what 'thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet' are? and no, commandments are not designed to help you live happily and without fear. its actually the exact opposite: commandments serve the purpose of keeping people under control through the use of fear.  sin means diobeying the commandments. as for homosexuality and witchcraft, they are sins because there are commandments against them.	i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?	notsarc

for those who are pro-life, how much of a role does your belief in a soul (assuming you hold such beliefs) play into your views on abortion? to explore this, would your views on a particular abortion change if you knew for certain that a particular fetus has no soul?the reason i bring this up is that, for those of us with largely secular views, the idea of the soul is closely analogous to our idea of mental existence, sentience, etc. i suspect, therefore, that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy. i know that, apart from that arguement, you value potential more than we do. however, i suspect that concepts of the soul do play a role in the views of most on the pro-life side. would you be willing to discuss such ideas?	i think more than this is the principle of human dignity. that humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. this is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. so strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. we build memorials to those who were victimized in life.	notsarc

my biggest problem with the gay rights issue is their tireless and often deceptive efforts to drag science into the whole thing. we know that there is nothing that ties biology and genes into sexual orientation, yet the gay society insists that there is, supporting shabby studies with inconclusive results and publishing them as facts. i have absolutely no problem with the gay lifestyle, marriage rights or social place. but when it must be done under the guise of false science, there is a problem from what ive seen, homosexuality, and sexuality on a whole, is indeed a complex issue. it is misunderstood, and many 'authorities' on the subject submit conflicting reports, making the issue even more complicated. not only that, but people guard their sexuality with strong emotions, and therefore tend to believe what they want to believe about it. it makes finding the truth 10 times more difficult.	we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?	notsarc

ooo, you had your gut cut open??  what a pity. i think you could have avoided alot of suffering if you had just used a condom. if you don't want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom.  why shouldn't fetuses have rights? once they're a fetus, then eliminating them is technically killing them. and at nine months, they're no longer dependent on it's mother's blood, and therefore is technically a baby. at nine months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby.	why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different.	notsarc

"asahi.com????????unloaded rifle on tv triggers controversy - englishotsu, shiga prefecture--given this nation's strict gun control law, were police overreacting when they swooped on a tv broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast?the shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights, but tv networks are outraged, citing the fact the weapon was not loaded.the incident stems from a show aired jan. 17 by biwako broadcasting co. almost four months later, police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items, including a script and a dvd of the show.critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives, but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant.shiga prefectural police regard the incident, in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed tv personality noburo harada, 57, to momentarily handle the rifle during the show, as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms.so much so, in fact, that on june 12, the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors. as a result, the hunter, aged 49, along with a 60-year-old tv producer and a 37-year-old director of the show, could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law.police did not pursue a case against harada even though he briefly handled the weapon. police argued that he did not actually ""possess"" the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast.police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken.the show, called ""tokimeki shiga's,"" is broadcast one saturday a month. in the show, harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide.the program in question was set in yogo, where harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat. the hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene. he offered the unloaded weapon to harada and asked,""do you want to hold it?""harada held the rifle and commented, ""it's heavy, isn't it?"" adding, ""not everybody has a chance to hold it, right?""he held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back.biwako broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised.the tv crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting.the prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer.the intervention by the police flabbergasted harada and employees of other tv stations.""i never could have imagined anything like this,"" harada, a former member of the male comedy duo anonenone, told reporters after he was questioned by police on june 2. ""i was stunned.""akihiko ito, head of the tv station's programming department, said the station would cooperate with police, but defended harada's actions.""we consulted our lawyers, and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it,"" he said.a spokesperson with a tv station based in osaka sharply criticized police.""they should have at least asked (biwako broadcasting) to cooperate voluntarily,"" a spokesperson said. ""from a common sense standpoint, we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking.""an employee at another tv station was also critical.""if we, for example, were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife, would the police investigate us, too?"" the employee asked. ""such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs. this would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming.""but police say they don't understand what all the fuss is about. they say the media has, by focusing on the celebrity angle, blurred the facts in the case.a senior official with the shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that harada briefly held the rifle, but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of ""storage and management.""an explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law, which took effect in january.the law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in sasebo, nagasaki prefecture, shot and killed two people and wounded six in december 2007. the man, known for erratic behavior, committed suicide after the shooting.the incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate.""i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said.according to the national police agency, police can file a case against anybody if he or she, with criminal intent to kill or injure people, possesses a weapon for even a second.a case can be built based not on the length of time of possession, but on the purpose of possession, the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner.the shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show.by transporting the gun to the show, the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit, police asserted.they defended questioning harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue--did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon?takaaki hattori, professor of media law at rikkyo university in tokyo, says that police went too far.""the way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing. i sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law,"" he said. ""they should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities.""but he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent.""the tv station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show. the gun owner may have been primarily responsible, but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law.""takaaki matsumiya, professor of criminal law at ritsumeikan university school of law in kyoto, disagrees that the tv station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities.citing a precedent set by the tokyo high court in june 1967, he said: ""the high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession,'"" he said. ""there have been no precedents to alter that interpretation. harada did not 'possess' it (during the show).""matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set.""when the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm, it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm,"" he said. ""it is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances.""(iht/asahi: july 2,2009)now then, what's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to america? i don't see such being the case, do you? if you can't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law, that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else.how can japan be so much better off than we are, if it's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep; especially when it's unloaded!?"	a taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.	notsarc

that's a false analogy. people who are sexually attracted to children harm children, and harming someone is a crime. homosexuals do no harm to anyone, and are nothing like pedophiles. and for someone who doesn't tolerate government intrusion, you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage. huh? are we talking about gays or fornicators? fornicators being someone who has sex before marriage and gay being a man who is attracted to a man in the same way a straight man is attracted to a woman. lets stay on topic.	i dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  we are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but i am sure the preacher would condemn that too  if you read the link you would know.  if homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  if gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  you really should try to use your little head more.

oh how arrogant, wikipedia is a grand tool for general information.  are you telling me that tiktaalik fossils, archeopteryx fossils and platypus don't exist, and that using wikipedia is somehow misleading in this sense?  these things do exist and i didn't think it necessary to cite peer reviewed material on such trivial matters.	wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information.	notsarc

it would be bad enough if it was just the teacher chewing gum and telling the students don't chew gum. but it doesn't stop there. the teacher makes the rule no gum chewing in class. then later that same day she instructs billy and sally to chew gum. johnny sees this and decides to chew gum too, thinking that its ok. of course, he gets expelled from school for breaking the rules. in this case the teacher isn't just breaking her own rules, she also commands some of her students to break the rules as well, yet still penalizes those who break the exact rule if they weren't commanded to do so.

waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb. what chance does an unexpecting child have against a grown person intent on killing him?	i think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (i have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. i am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).	notsarc
i am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun. data from the fbi shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense. i would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use. on a related note, as was recently confirmed by the scotus, owning a firearm is an individual right. i am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.	because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. when this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.if you read around you'll see that i consider all rights as needing justification. this comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a uk citizen, where there is no formalised constitution. ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?	notsarc

yet it is a conculsion derived without evidence. it is only based on what is seen in an instant, not what is seen through time. you just proved my point that there is a preconcieved notion. it has been taught to you. (at least, i seriously doubt you have gone out and observed something evolving first-hand). constant mutation in every generation is not something observed. it still would not account for the extreme specificity of nylon. again, the chances of- a random mutation allowing multiple (i assume there was more than 1 survivor) organisms to digest a synthetic material that happens to be dumped where they are- are very much against it	quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random.	notsarc

"the question was about whales. pay attention will you? you're right; i didn't type anything in at all. i just asked huntard to prove his claim. but in response to your propaganda piece, here's some opposing evidence. the third problem, 'as zimmer acknowledges', is that there aren't very many early whale fossils. does that surprise you? evolutionists have probably led you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution is, pardon the expression, rock-solid. but there isn't really that much 'hard' evidence. whale evolution is mostly imaginary, or speculative at best. since whales are mammals, evolutionists imagined that a land-going mammal must have returned to the sea. at first, they imagined this without any fossil evidence. so, they went looking for fossils to support their preconceived ideas. the first hint that they were probably right came in 1983, when researcher phil gingerich found a 52-million year old skull in shallow deposits in pakistan. although fragmentary, the skull had teeth that were nearly identical with those of mesonychids and the archaeocetes. … despite the whale-like characteristics of the skull, however, pakicetus lacked two important adaptations which are present in modern whales. in living whales, the ears contain large sinuses that can be filled with blood, allowing the animal to maintain pressure while diving. modern whales also transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear using a 'fat pad', which allows them to hear directionally underwater. pakicetus lacked both of these features, indicating that it was unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater. these anatomical clues meshed well with its habitat, since the pakicetus bones were found in deposits that had been laid down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea, where the opportunities for deep diving would be limited. although no post-cranial bones of pakicetus were found, it seemed logical to assume, from the teeth and ear structure, that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water looking for food, but returned to the land to rest, somewhat like a modern sea lion. … the earliest known cetacean, pakicetus, demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans are descended from the mesonychid carnivores. although we have not found any post-cranial bones from pakicetus yet, ... 5 consider what this evolutionist has just told us. first, they haven't found any post-cranial bones of pakicetus. [since this essay was written, they have found some post-cranial bones.] post-cranial bones are bones below the skull. so, all they have found is a skull. they don't have a single pakicetus rib. they don't have any pakicetus vertebrae. no other bones of any kind. just a skull--and a fragmentary one at that. why do they think it came from a whale ancestor? because its teeth look like whale teeth. but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater. the skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore. yet it ""demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans [whales] are descended from the mesonychid carnivores."" in a whale of trouble so the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion. that's real complete and reliable information that justifies making such an absolute claim from. not!!! emoticonxdonno"	only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/image:pakicetus_(1).jpg  replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why i put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy.	sarc

"and some of those tests fail. there are holes in the theory of gravity. yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. evolution is fact because ""we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it"". further there are very few holes in that theory. evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. what i think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. but evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact."	notsarc

with myself being one of the american sheep here, ( an alert one tho, ) i was hoping to see someone post a big secret, saying that our govt has a secret fuel source all ready to go , but were just holding out on it, until the oil was almost gone, and everyone had gotten all of their riches from the fossil fuel. then once the gas is almost gone, the govt would spring this new non-fossiled fuel out on to the public , a most opportune time to get the best price from it, of course... well, per daewoo, the above scenario is not true, so anyone with their eyes wide open can see where this is all heading. if someone doesnt do something soon, does orwell's 1984 or road warrior, come to mind ? :)	that's probably being saved for the next round of national election fodder. maybe something on the order of occupying all the me, making it a christian democracy while we use their oil for their own good? with every family owning their own home, two cars and a boat. wait, they've used that promise and it failed. not to worry, i'm sure they'll come up with something that'll keep the sheep headed towards the cliff.	sarc

unkerpauliei think your analogy breaks down with a little thought. if i have a check for a million dollars and i take it to a copy machine and make a copy, i am quite aware that the copy will not be perfect. there is an imperfect mechanical divice between the check and the copy. or are you saying that god has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy.my thought was that god was the direct agent of creation (without the use of intervening mechanical devices), and being a perfect being incapable creating imperfection (for then he would not be god), all of his creation would be as perfect as he is.so does this perfect god have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters?

2005 publicized aid to israel was $5-billion, about average for that country. that doesn't include $28-billion in 2002 to fight terrorism, with subsequent yearly amounts classified and not for publication. the us also picks up about 50% of israel's ongoing deficits and trade imbalances in the form of israeli debt for israel to maintain a small positive payment balance for trade credit and public confidence purposes. pull those numbers from their primarily transactional gdp and problems would quickly appear cumulating with that spiral effect.  over 30% of present israeli gdp in public service is difficult to fund from domestic tax revenues, presently the highest in the free world, without incurring abnormal debt. israel is riding on the coattails of us elastic debt policy.	making up numbers again georged? care to post some links to this data?in 2005 israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. as for the 28 billion in 2002...i know that is wrong. i recall a 200 million dollar thing, but i don't know if it went through.the rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so.	notsarc

bryan makes a good point though. bloomberg is basically trying to suggest that if we got tough on gun laws here in virginia that the crime rate in new york city would go down. this is pretty doubtful. you never really see someone go 'man, i'd xxxx your head off but guns are too expensive'. instead, people are just smart enough to get guns where it is easiest. should those 10 states suddenly become the hardest states to get guns in than you'd see 10 other states be on that list with the exact same crime rates. the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws.	i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.	notsarc

since evolutionism and creationism are both attempting to answer the same question, (i.e., how come existence?) they are mutally exclusive, and if one is true, it automatically falsifies the other. this means that if evolutionism is accepted as true, then logically creationism, and by extension the entire bible, is false. the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity.with all that in consideration, it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false	"i see a subtle distinction here. creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people.

you're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. if you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. you have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. you're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. we have taxed the xxxx out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time i checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.	first of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. what hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.	notsarc

i fail to understand the fascination with mrs. kerry's wealth. george washington inherited wealth, including money and property. and then proceeded to marry the wealthiest widow in dc, who had far more wealth than george. the only reason i can fathom for people condemning kerry for marrying wealth is jealousy. all other things being equal, i'd take a well-traveled, multi-language, filthy rich woman actively engaged in various sectors of society over a dirt-poor librarian every time. (no slur on librarians, i know some who are fine people, including a wealthy one, just a comparison for the thread) as to mrs. kerry's tax filing extension, that's available to any and all taxpayers. all one does is pay the taxes due and request an automatic extension for filing. and that extension can, with reasonable cause, be again extended all the way into october.	along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen.	notsarc

the vast majority of proclamations and assumptions illustrating a cultural gap between science and christianity, such as this post, are over emphasized and exaggerated as they focus on people who are expected to be out of touch (ie. people educated in the 40's and 50's when higher education was less common) or a very small percentage of christians. christians included in mass people of all academic backgrounds who find their paradigm consistent with their viewable (and non-observable) reality and by alienating them in mass by focusing on the minority of christians you perpetuate falsehoods.	actually, the more educated a person is, the less likely he is to be a creationist. creationists tend to be semi-literate (poorly educated), rural, poor, and female.	notsarc
i have read the opinions and conclusions reached in several internet entries and i can see how they would largely persuade someone to think that the side-by-side dinosaur and human prints in stone do not exist. however, before you reach a personal conclusion, i would really recommend you visiting the site. awe is not strong enough to describe the feeling that overcomes you when you personally witness this. i have been there and felt the chill when i saw what could only be prints of very old humans co-existing with dinosaurs. there is hardly a rebuttal that works when one is personally exposed to such an odd and even eerie site. the heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances, the toes. before the naysayers offer a rebuttal, i think a visit to the paluxy river around glenrose might be in order. when you do, i think you will agree that there really is nothing like it. you might even revise your opinions regarding order and origins of life.	sounds pretty neat. i've never been there but i'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.so you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? i know that there are people who believe in this but i don't come across them very often. so what information do you have to share with us about this idea?	notsarc

saw a great article today by michael bloomberg (yes, that michael bloomberg), about where the illegal guns used in crimes come from - mainly from the states with weak gun control laws. this is unsurprising to most rational folk, but yet we still hear the pro-gun clarion call to have no new gun laws, etc. so here's the article for all to read: stop spread of illegal guns from states with weak laws - cnn.com 	it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes.	notsarc

from my memory your medical references both showed the trend you state, but they were also limited in geography and sample (two cities), and provided no casue and effect, merely a curious relationship in the numbers.	"well let's deal with one thing at a time. the nejm study about washington d.c. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. the study didn't conclude that it was just a ""curious relationship in the numbers."" go back to that thread and read the study. if you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. you can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. what you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. you're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."	notsarc

i just wonder why the polls showed such support for bush at first, but after the liberal press got their claws in him and began tearing away, suddenly the support waivered. are you gonna tell me that this change in support comes from logical thought? c'mon, i give you a little more credit than that. most americans interpret? geeeeeeez, most americans don't know their a** from a hole in the ground, they just listen to the sound bytes that are dished out by the liberal press	so their support of bush (so you say) means exactly what? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush's rhetoric? and where is bush is the man and jim's trucking? usually they're all over it when someone says something bad about the american people. oh, that's right... it's ok when a person on the right says it, it's when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue.	notsarc

let me try to translate into words1. if there is a god in this world, there is a god in all worlds2. there being a god is a possibility3. if there's a god in all worlds, there's a god in this one4. there not being a god in all worlds implies that there's isn't a god in any world (all or nothing)5. there is either a god in all worlds or there isn't a god in all worlds6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world7. if there's no god in this world then there's not a god in all worlds8. there's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world.9. since god is a possibility we know the statement <there is no god in any world> is false.10. since there's a god in all worlds there's a god in this one from 3is this the right interpretation? if it is there is one flaw in it. #9 is flawed. just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.	"i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is god has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, must have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, god is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that god exists? hmmm....emoticonxfrazzled"	notsarc

eugene volokh • july 29, 2010 11:48 pm  friday, the michigan supreme court handed down an interesting case — people v. dupree on this. the case is not novel, and my sense is that the defense is generally recognized: just as what would otherwise be the crime of murder, attempted murder, battery, and the like might be justified if done in defense against an imminent threat, so a felon's taking possession of a gun is justified if done in defense against an imminent threat. (the defense does not apply to a felon's arming himself against a possible threat of attack at some indefinite future time.) still, the case struck me as an interesting illustration. thanks to jason c. miller for the pointer.	did you slip in it again? were you led astray by a passage from heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control, your wet dream?i submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error.	sarc
why, the god of the bible, of course! turning water to wine, walking on water, stopping the sun in it's tracks, raising the dead, etc... are all in conflict with the laws of physics but...who cares?

the fetus is non-sentient, so it has no 'desire'. the fetus is totally dependent on a woman's body, and has no existence without the woman's body. this is not the case with a dog. this is not the case with the woman. she is a sentient person, and not a container. she undergoes physical changes and physical risks by being pregnant. she risks, and she sacrifices, using her own body. it is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life. it will never have the same kind of impact on his health and on his life, that it will have on hers. not even close.	apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken.	sarc
people make definitions. they then make statements that make sense according to those defintions. you interept their statements terms of your own defintions. maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you interept them using their defintions and their defintions alone. you do not seem to think this should be done. this is the main reason why people treat you the way they do. it actually has little to do with them practicing objectivism or scientism.	for one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything.....	sarc

right now, i might consider it, as i am now a few weeks away from my graduation. back then, i would not, as i had just begun college (i was in my sophomore year for my bs - now i'm about to get my ms). however, there is also that other major part of my decision - i never had the intention to become pregnant, and we even took steps to make sure i wouldn't. that also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it.  another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors i spoke with) - i would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now i am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then i was just starting out, and would be unable to do so. so, i'd say that at the moment if that were to happen, and that i was paid a stipend (i know of no place near me that does so) and then gave the baby up for adoption, my fiance and i would seriously consider the prospect. i know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans, and we will then consider actually having a baby. so in summary - now i would consider it, but back when i had the actual abortion (6 years ago or so) i would not consider it.	that sounds like an honest answer. how did you feel about it at the time? how do you feel about it now? just trying to educate myself more.   huck	notsarc

well i'm not arguing that this is adaptation...i have never said that.. what i am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring	oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? they're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. that's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.	notsarc
sorry i missed your thread on that. it sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother's death and or/complete debilitation (like paralysis), and i'd be much more open to that. but as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and scotus chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure. i'd also add that because this is a late term procedure, if health is the reason to not take the baby to term, then caesarian delivery very well might be an option, in many cases.	and that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why i do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact i am rather disgusted with it). if you'd like to see a more concise view from me, you can see the thread that another_opinion started here: http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/9678-mothers-health-exception-where-do-we-draw-line.html	notsarc

"of course everyone has some basis for their views. not even denying that. however there are ways that using that ""basis"" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. there are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. that is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. all i am asking here is that archie, you, jp, etc. own that."	notsarc

the benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple (of age of consent) to join in a civil union. right . . . but rather than removing every reference to marriage from every state and federal law and replacing it with the words 'civil union' and then extending the right to participate in a civil union to gay people and straight people alike, wouldn't it be way easier just to, uh, let gay people get married? besides, if the idea of gay marriage is seen as an 'attack' on straight marriage, how exactly is the notion of removing 'marriage' altogether going to be construed? not as a friendly compromise, i'm betting.	oh yeah. way easier. which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started. ;) marriage would only be removed from any legal document. it will still appear in religious documents. the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists.	sarc

"they are different terms and apply to different things. secularism is not a worldview in itself, it is a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life.secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview. one may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of ""let them burn in hell afterwards"", or something else along those lines)."	so if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout christian believes god is the highest form of intelligence, the christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?	notsarc

"'white guilt is the biggest flaw in the american psyche', says dr. david yeagley, comanche indian source: comanche_patriot —————————— white pride and white guilt today in the united states and most of the white world, as soon as a white child begins his formal education, he is implicitly told that he should feel guilt for the crimes of his ancestors. guilt for finding, conquering, enslaving, and killing off non-whites around the globe ... and littering in the process. this guilt stems not from his own crimes, but from the supposed crimes of other (dead) people of the same race. but the child is never encouraged to take pride in the amazing achievements of his race. more: white pride and white guilt —————————— white guilt, obamamania, and the reality of race supporting obama for president, like supporting colin powell a decade ago, is seen by many whites as the ultimate in white guilt repellent. i don't recall ever meeting any white person who personally felt guilty for the troubles of african-americans. but i've known many whites who want to loudly blame other whites for black difficulties. more: vdare.com: 01/02/07 - white guilt, obamania, and the reality of race —————————— white guilt = black power white guilt is best understood as a vacuum of moral authority. whites live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of blacks. whites simply come to a place with blacks where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of being seen as racist. one terrible feature is that it means whites lack the authority to say what they see when looking at blacks and black problems. political correctness is what whites have the authority to say about blacks, no matter what they see. it is a language of severely limited authority, of euphemisms that steer whites around associations with racism. the muteness that white guilt imposes on whites undergirds black power. it lets blacks live inside the silence of whites, and have our weaknesses be unutterable by whites even as they are plainly visible. messrs. jackson and sharpton are enforcers of white silence. and when whites are silent, black mediocrity is no deterrent to black advancement. everywhere that minorities press institutions today as groups, there is an erosion of excellence. the reason for this is that white guilt allows institutions to respond only with deference – deferring to the greater moral authority of minorities by lowering standards, and remaining mute to minority mediocrity, to save the institution from the racist label. so whites have made it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institutions erode. the public schools are all but devastated, universities are stunted by ideology, corporations are more unctuous than churches, the media are more unctuous yet, and american politicians – of left and right – speak in barren clichés about all of this when they speak at all. more: white guilt = black power —————————— white guilt...myth or reality? shana attends a big 12 school and is always seeing white girls her age or younger propositioned by black men who get offended if rebuffed. she personally knows of one girl who had her entire social life ruined by a black man who called her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him. 'he said something like, 'xxxx, you just won't be wit' me 'cause i be black'.' a hush settled over the crowd and a bunch of people looked at her like she was a pariah. the girl ended up going back home when all of her dormmates started harassing her for being a 'bigot'. white guilt is when a white person feels sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own rights, and often their own self-respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sins of their ancestors. arabs had slaves. as long as the slave was not muslim it was legal. arabs were even the organizers of the african slave trade to the west. yet there is no arab guilt over slavery. the romans had their entire economy powered by slaves. and often their own people were slaves. yet there is no italian or roman guilt. and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade was that many african tribes made raids on other tribes and then sold their human booty to western or arabic slavers, yet there is no african guilt. why white guilt then? one of the reasons is the media. more: queen of succubi presents white guilt fact or myth? —————————— white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever just recently, after declining a funding request from one of chicago's numerous beggars, i heard a most peculiar thing. the man yelled at me as i walked away: ""i'm sorry i'm not white."" at first i assumed he was talking to someone else; then i saw that he wasn't. his tactic must have been an attempt to shame pedestrians into giving him more change. presumably, as the man did not look like a novice to this ancient profession, it must be a strategy that, with the exception of this occasion, works, which tells us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian americans. more: american renaissance news: white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever —————————— the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade one of the many weapons which our opponents use against us, and also against others of european ancestry, is often termed historical white guilt. those who hate us point accusingly to our empire, and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we, particularly the british and european americans, are uniquely guilty of crimes against other races. they believe that, by making us feel guilty about our past, we will be less inclined to object to what is done to us on behalf of our alleged 'victims'. more: the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade | national policy institute here is an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe. ."	oh blah! blah! blah!  what the devil do comanches know?  the sisterhood and brotherhood of sioux, navajo, iroquois and other sundry tribes.	sarc

holy shit :( that's why i never take stuff from people i barely know. i know a guy who got tricked into smoking crack.  i successfully quit smoking, and hope to re-kick my caffeine habit. weed was by far the hardest for me to quit, since it kind of immerses you in the subculture. you end up having to cut people off from your life, because peer pressure really isn't a myth. in fact, weed is the only drug people ever try to insist i use. i guess it's because it's perceived as harmless.	i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?	notsarc

there are no criminal penalties for private individuals and organizations violating the constitutional rights of other private individuals. your backpack and person may be searched without a warrant if they have reason to suspect you of having stolen something. as there are no penalties that means there is no crime having been committed. the civil rights act of 1964 is another matter of discussion entirely. unfortunately until lower court cases build precedent to show that firearms ownership is a civil right and will be treated as such there is nothing that can be done when private individuals choose to prohibit firearms on said property.	a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost, a private individual will get sued for assault, and false imprisonment at the least. there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison. you can ignore an illegal law with impunity. we have the ruling. we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases. you implied there were none and that is false. would you like to take a stab at nunn v, state of georgia for instance? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier, oveturned case in people v zirillo. how can you miss so much?	notsarc

modern-day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures, past and present, and the consequent improbability that just one of them (and hey, waddaya know? it's mine!) is wholly true and all the others wholly false. this leads some into woolly new-age-ist pick-and-mixing; others to conclude that the world's religions are all the product of a similar, purely mundane, process of cultural evolution, and that none actually reflects fundamental truths.	these aren't the only two options available. the many philosophical views of the material world or ethics don't mean these two things don't exist.	notsarc

while you see the need to not only debate him on points, then post an expose about your ideas of his capability, i'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology. how does the phrase 'survival of the fittest' change in any way, what evolution is, the evidence that supports it, and the fact that there simply is no strong evidence for any other mechanism by which humans have come to be, on earth? i ask because i assume you must think there is some relevance to the discussion of creation vs evolution. there might not be, that's ok too, i'd just like to make sure we don't put words in your mouth. -mach	yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?	sarc
lol. that's silly. scientific facts keep changing, because they keep building on what is proven. the actual basis for the facts hasn't changed at all, merely the newest accepted idea is. as time progresses that idea is tested, tested, tested and tested again until it is proven. your statement reveals sheer ignorance as to the scientific process.	the fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method. there is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being, and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact, yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god. mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others i have spoke with on this subject. i do believe in scientific method, but i also have faith that god is out there.	notsarc

similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. so to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its dna.	invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. but there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.	notsarc

"'life threatening condition that is always physically harmful""? what a giant load of steamy bs. rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. there are over 6 billion people on this earth today. if motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth? where do you get this bs from, planned parenthood?

mizmax, that's completely different. the infirtle couples who want to have children and are capable of doing so with sciencetific methods may be married. however, infirtle couples who don't have the capability and wont try to, shouldn't. having children isn't a requirement for marriage- it's what marriage is all about.	so, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be ok, right?   if it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   what about lesbians? they can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. in facst, they can both get pregnant. does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   what if a couple of gay men adopt? then is their marriage valid?   if i have a vasectomy, am i divorced?   you are confusing me. please explain.	sarc

"happygrl35, the premise from the man's perspective is the same arguement pro-choicers argue, all they are doing is legally terminating a mass of tissue, not a human being. according to pro-choicers, life isn't conceived at conception, so if i man after having sex with a woman and the woman becomes pregnant, she is not pregnant with a baby, she is pregnant with a cell that can ""develop"" into a baby. if a man say's i opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human being, then he too like the woman already has, should have the opt-out option. a woman can do with her body what she so chooses, like she does, however, everyone including women must mitigate their own damages. if a woman who is pregnant with a few ""cell clusters"" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation. remember, when the man left after having sex, he did not create a human being according to pro-choicers, if at most he created a ""cell"". according to pro-choicers, cells do not translate into a human life. a male should have an opt-out period just like the woman, before the cells become a human being.emoticonxhoho god, i love it. pro-choicers don't even want to live by their own words. i'm trying to understand their position. its a ""cluster of cells"", ""a mass of tissue"", ""not a human being"", ""no heartbeat"" ""no brainwave therefore, not a human being yet"", so if a man say's i opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human being then, like his female counterpart, should be able terminate his parental duty, that he never created, she did. he and she only created a cell not a human."	first of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.the father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.	sarc

woopiee... i would have to say that you are putting yourself deeper and deeper into the ccoi every post you are making. you see, this is talking about 'biblical creation'... you know, taking genesis literally, and all that type of nonsense. there are many deeply religious christians that have no problem in accepting that genesis is a story, and not historically accurate. it takes someone profoundly stupid and ignorant to pull that stuff out of their rear. and like i said, 'undisputable' is totally stupid.. because even if the evidence is 100 percent positive, you have xxxxxx that will dispute it.  i mean, this link has undisputable evidence of horse evolution, yet you will dispute it anyway horse evolution over 55 million years	we are not talking about genesis as a story are we? we are talking about bilbical creation. you really are thick arent you? i know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. the horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry.	notsarc

"among homosexual men in particular, casual sex, rather than committed relationships, is the rule and not the exception. and even when they do enter into a more committed relationship, it is usually of relatively short duration. for example, a study of homosexual men in the netherlands (the first country in the world to legalize ""marriage"" for same-sex couples), published in the journal aids in 2003, found that the average length of ""steady partnerships"" was not more than 2 < years (maria xiridou et al., in aids 2003, 17:1029-1038)."	and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. it is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. you just get data from the right place. if you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. if you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. the truth is that to have honest statistical data you need random samples.	sarc

the classic anti-gunner misinterpretation. what i'm advocating is that we stop this naive belief that we can save lives by banning guns on and around school property, because the victims of columbine and virginia tech will tell you that this belief is wrong. despite this inane fear that so many have, there aren't going to be shootouts between students and teachers over a d- term paper. how do i know this? because the people that have permits to legally carry guns aren't murdering each other over dented fenders, parking spots and disagreements over which football team is best. furthermore the 1,000 foot gun free proximity zone around the school is totally useless. it does nothing to ensure or promote safety, it's just a big inconvenience to people who live near a school, and a potential trap to anybody who's traveling to or from the local range. should you really be guilty of breaking a federal law by simply having a gun while being 999 feet away from a school, while your friend who's 1,001 feet away from the same school, with a gun, is completely innocent and not facing felony charges? the intelligent answer in this case would be 'no'.	you said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. how is that a misinterpretation?   you're asking for proof of a negative. how many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? we don't know...   erm.... you're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? i suggest you surf youtube for a bit. rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   i agree that's silly. i'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class.	notsarc
this is the old viability arguement, but it just doesn't hold up. it means that as our medical technology has gotten progressively better, and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at earlier and earlier stages because of this, the point at which it is unethical and/or considered murder has gotten earlier.	there is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. so, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.	notsarc

for once i find myself agreeing with randomdude. i've been in a church of several christian denominations and never seen a 'holy' bible that was just the nt. i've never been to a church where all the sermons are drawn exclusively from the nt. and i know that most christians embrace things like the ten commandments, which are ot all the way. the ot is a prelude, it sets a backstory for the coming of christ, but things depicted in it (like original sin) are essential to the message of jesus; without the ot, the nt is baseless nonsense - well, more than it is already, anyways.	well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels.	notsarc

it is not the existence of the gay people that moralizing families question. their opposition to them being in the video is not based on that. their view is that it shouldn't be considered a 'family' in the acceptable sense of the term. not that they exist. surely you know this. now, you and i don't agree with that, but the question here is whether or not the school should teach about issues that moralistic ones in peoples' minds, such as this one. imo, they shouldn't. there is a broader issue here. so you think censoring over the issue being a moralistic one is ridicuous, eh? so you'd have no problem with schools teaching that people should go to church? or that male kids can have more than one wife at a time when they grow up? those too are moralistic-based issues to many people.	so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today.	sarc

do you even follow the news?? seriously. there have been cases of msnbc being so offensive that even hillary clinton basically threatened to boycott them. geez. as far as huffington is concerned, the site you linked to itself is a good example, and is indicative of the same sort of junk liberals criticize conservative talking heads for. for instance, where were the photos that present tea party protestors in a positive light? why would they want to to take 10 photos (out of no doubt thousands that were perfectly peaceful) that present the worst possible elements they could find? that such doesn't raise a red flag to you speaks volumes.	i love it when the left dogs beck but blatantly shows their bias by not covering news stories detrimental to our pot-earred president. ;)	sarc
that's a matter of interpretation, 'god's spirit moved over the water' is in the old testament. the holy spirit is referred to repeatedly by jesus in the gospels, and the working of the spirit is a central theme in acts and paul's letters.	in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus.	notsarc
more concrete than the thought processes which dismiss out of hand the flat statement of the us secretary of state opining that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, but allow them only to be lawfully held by the state? sleep well.	no kidding. what could possibly be more concrete? as far as i can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the dc gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she did say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, i have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of dc should be allowed to own guns, unless what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. she did not, as far as i know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system.	notsarc
"secondly, i see you are falling into the usual o.p. of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard ""n"" is right next to ""b"" last time i checked). really phyllis, get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors."	no, that was not an argument. it was an illustration of a point. the point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of god, you would have to be of higher moral character than god. in other words, you would have to be god in order to judge god. now, the point i made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be god would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.to be clear, i was not attacking you (at least i didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. i was trying to illustrate a point. and the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not god. and if you are not god, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of god.	notsarc

'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked.

it is an absract concept, but i draw attention to the fact that no man can speak on this issue with the perspective that a woman can by virtue of the fact they can never be pregnant. so i suggest that it is very easy to say something is wrong when you cannot appreciate the fullness of the issue- a man will never be placed in the situation where they will be pregnant but do not wish to have a baby at that point.	by your logic, do i have to be a murdered to understand that murder is wrong? this 'walk a mile in my sandals' stuff is just bs. i don't have to be a woman to view abortion as not being moral.	sarc

anyone who looks at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have been a time when there was less genetic damage in the genome. – and thus, longer lives. can anyone think of time that this may have happened? i can! the bible reports there was a time in the history of humans that lifespans were incredibly long. according to genesis people lived to over 900 years old.	according to genesis? why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? should i present the davinci code as scientific evidence? how about darwin's on the origin of the species?	sarc
how could they be 'accurate' and be wrong? there is nothing 'less accurate' about that, it is wrong! i think you've been reading too much george orwell, you've come up with new speak for science.	really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?	notsarc
common sense. the number of living species that have escaped our attention cannot compare to those that have gone extinct over several billion years of life with numerous mass extinctions, remembering that fossils are rare.	surely, we can only 'guesstimate' how many living species have escaped our attention ? but how probable is it that only 1% of all the species that ever existed escaped extinction ?  i think your point about mass extinctions may be a key to what has puzzled me.	notsarc
there are many problems with society depending on which part of society one belongs to. i don't know that i'd call them a series because some are unrelated. there's a serious problem of apathy in education. people don't seem to want to learn.	i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills.	notsarc
i don't have the right  to make accusations about logical fallacies and how do you know i don't know what they mean. explain. i don't remember correcting your spelling, please refresh my memory.	again, this wasn't just about you and me. i do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist.	notsarc
"heading further down that path...if the ""right"" belongs to the child, then the ""right"" obviously also does not belong to those opposed to gays.more specifically, the ""right"" to waive potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays.the ""right"" would belong to the child to decide who he/she wants, and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to deny the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option."	well, this gets rather complicated. a very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. in private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. the foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. so it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. they vary greatly.the point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.	notsarc
if creationism replaced science? first, we'd have to discard the fact that the earth is billions of years old. second, we'd have to discard the facts of the order of appearance of organisms, and switch back to the incorrect chronology listed in genesis. third, we'd have to reclassify bats as birds. fourth, we'd have to scrap the fully supported fact and theory of evolution. fifth, we'd have to go back to believing that people think with their hearts. and so on, and so on.	you forgot to mention that we would have to change our numbering system so that grasshoppers had 4 legs.	sarc

um, in the debate description it talks about how marx predicted that laissez faire capitalism would lead to an the nation being ruled by an elite few, which would cause the working majority to revolt. i merely showed how socialism with private property is fascism and capitalism with regulations is fascism. am i saying it's bad? no, that's for you decide. if you like fascism, good for you.	alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?	notsarc

so guns are more important than the safety of women? then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?  so men love their guns more than women? is that some kind of homosexuality? ya know a gun is kind of shaped like, um, you know what. a gun does ejaculate in a sense.	i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast.	sarc

in a way, taking rights away is an american value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. for instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights. here are just a small number that come to mind:1) right to murder2) right to own slaves3) right to rape4) right to abusing children5) right to vote6) right to smoke (if you're under 18)7) right to drink (18th amendment)8) right to engage in certain activities in public9) right to drive as fast as one wants10) right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest riverthe list goes on really. the fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. that is quite inconsistent.where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway?	in what universe is there a right to murder?unfortunately, we in the united states have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.and, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the united states.what certain activities are forbidden in public?some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. not for safety reasons, of course.and, george walker bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.	notsarc

apparently gay marriage is more threatening than unmarried gay couples are. the point about legalizing gay households is certainly puzzling unless one contends that cohabitation is illegal (which it isn't). but just in case i'm wrong, perhaps the authorities should be notified of all the heterosexual unmarried couples and they should be hauled off to jail.	oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. we can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make britney look bad ( although, i have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) we have the power. we are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)	sarc

we weren't competing with chimps? oh really? doesn't evo claim that the first humans and hominids appeared in africa? and isn't the dark continent also the natural and original ecosystem where the great apes are from? so how do you claim we never competed if evo is true?	because africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. there are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. their food sources are different, their territories are different. the more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. pretty straightforward, really.	notsarc

should gun registration be mandatory ? http://www.youdebate.com/debates/gun_registration.htm	no, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the us. the government has no business knowing who has a gun. gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the bill of rights. just knowing that there are many senators and congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd amendment in the future.   p.s. crazy is as crazy says. scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. the alibi better be outstanding!	sarc

the simple fact is, in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body. liberty unfettered by morality is the operative rule of anarchy, not civilization. at any given moment, each of us is constrained by hundreds of laws reflecting our moral responsibilities to our community. the most primal of those rules is the obligation of a mother to her helpless child. this is one of the reasons the public outcry against susan smith was so intense.	strawman. the argument is not to do whatever one wishes with ones body. the argument is soley that one does not have to have another attached, ever, against ones will.	notsarc

the problem with id is that there is no evidence, and it is simply not possible to falsify it. if we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was, evolution would be falsified. intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it. that is the line between religion and science.	the problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. if we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no god) were indisputably true, then id would be falsified. there is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. 	notsarc

this entire issue was dealt with on this threat here, starting at post250.	you either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. post 250 (which i had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but dametel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. that has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the denton talks about. evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.	notsarc

morality, in the strictest sense of the word, deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong. the term is often used to refer to a system of principles and judgments shared by cultural, religious, and philosophical concepts and beliefs, by which humans subjectively determine whether given actions are right or wrong.  you do know the difference between right and wrong don't you? i see no reason teachers shouldn't play a part in attempting to teach pupils the difference.	up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms.	notsarc

so what is the bible then? simply a nice story-book for you to read from? if genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution, what about the ten commandments? it always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of genesis or the arc, but god really does hate the homosexuals. it says so in leveticus, right? so it must be word perfect truth... this bit about the origins of the earth? oh, we just interpret that as god designing evolution. but that part about people burning in hell for eternity, that's true, right?	what about them? is this a question?   um. have you read leveticus? and i mean, read it. not skimmed it.   because, god loves everybody. are you reaching?   and what does fast and loose mean? i'm confused. i think you are trying to label me.. but i'm not quite sure what i'm being labled as.   what part about people burning in hell for eternity?	sarc

whether the anglican church is apostolic or not is a matter of opinion. the roman church started as an imperial church. its claim to apostolic succession is dubious as well, given the nature of some of the pope's in the middle ages, who were clearly chosen by outside influences. the independence of the church of england may have started with henry, but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth. the priest was and is well aware that i am an anglican, though we are of the same faith, christianity. so was his predecessor who i also received communion from. deviation from catholic dogma is common in the catholic church.	ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?	notsarc
to me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. but those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. and the woman comes first. it's between her and her physician. it's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not.

their beliefs are fanciful. we might as well give credence to murray the mystical eeel as having created the earth and the universe. it's unparsimonious.you don't need absolute proof for something to be valid. there is no credible proof for creationism, and evolution is the only other viable, parsimonious explanation.	just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. i feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. you do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.	sarc

biology shouldn't simply deal with the facts about different animals, natural selection, evolution, etc. but should also deal with how information is gathered, and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts.	if science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. the base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. maybe in saddam hussien's iraq, maybe in communist russia, but not in the united states.	sarc

"then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. while anyone can accept that a ""perfect"" judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before."	well, what faults? you say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. the death penalty is mearly a punishment. i will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. a perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. if we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an iv in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals. 	notsarc
guidance by humans in the blind watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . in the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection. you could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but i don't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans. i will show youyou could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. if some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. if it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). so if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. what about a double adaptor? all it does is let the current go through two different circuits. now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? no. why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. a lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when i imagined i was an electron going through a wire and how happy i would be going down a wire. electrons are not happy but i still had an analogy that gave me answers so i was happy. i would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.	again, it's not the point. there are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory	notsarc

governmental funding is not available (to my knowledge) without some (if not total) government control of the program. if there's any sure way to install inefficiency in a program, it is to let the government run it. i favor privatization, allowing those who want the program to fund and control it, those who don't to decline. donations would be tax deductible.	even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo.	notsarc
true, but as lurch corrected me before: it is the theory of evolution.	and i'm going to correct you again. the theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. it is the prevailing view. more than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.	notsarc

which is why it should be done on a case-by-case basis. sometimes there can be an age gap of 5 years and it could still be consensual, so imo fine, but other times it could be 4 years age difference and not fine (eg, a 14 year old and a ten year old) i'm not really sure how that analogy is relevant. -wez	your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.	notsarc

first off the single common ancestor model has no demonstratable mechanism for how it is even possible. for another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective/objective duality is the philosophy of natural science. there is only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning (theoretical) and empirical testing (demonstrative). objectivism is based on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter. none of these things are subject to peer review since there is a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning.	********. utter fraking ****. scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. you choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.	notsarc

libertarians are social liberals and economic conservatives. they want decreased regulations on society (legalize drugs, gay marriage, etc.)...

"court: seattle police ok to stun pregnant womanby gene johnson associated press writerseattle -- three seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.malaika brooks was driving her son to seattle's african american academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. she insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. one reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.the officers - sgt. steven daman, officer juan ornelas and officer donald jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the taser. she sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and u.s. district judge richard jones allowed the case to continue. he declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said brooks' rights were clearly violated.but in a 2-1 ruling friday, a panel of the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals disagreed. judges cynthia holcomb hall and diarmuid f. o'scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.the use of force was also justified because of the threat brooks posed, hall wrote: ""it seems clear that brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.""they also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the taser was in ""touch"" mode rather than ""dart"" mode, which hurts more. they reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.the officers' lawyers, ted buck and karen cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced.""police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders,"" buck said. that's all the court recognized today. the 9th circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances.""the majority's opinion outraged judge marsha berzon, who called it ""off the wall.""""i fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against brooks, let alone three activations of a taser, in response to such a trivial offense,"" she wrote.she argued that under washington law, the officers had no authority to take brooks into custody: failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.berzon said the majority's notion that brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. to obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.furthermore, brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, berzon said.brooks' lawyer, eric zubel, said he would ask the 9th circuit to rehear the case.""this is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever,"" he said."	for anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. they don't care about life. (except their own.)this same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. they wouldn't defend that right either.because they don't care about the fetus. they don't care about life. they don't care about health. they care about power and money and pushing people around. that's all.	notsarc
why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when i offer my vote/opinion, i am imposing something evil on you?	let me explain this to you.you want to stop abortions for someone else. you want to take a womans right to choose away. where as jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.you want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. the left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.you want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though i may have a religious belief that supports it. therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when i do not share those beliefs.	notsarc

is it now? is it backed up by the stats? what's your evidence aside from 'it sounds right to me'? but the same applies to most countries - particularly in the west. [url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_related_attacks'] and yet us school killings account for more deaths in this list than the rest of the world put together (counting like-for-like situations, not rebel military actions such as in vietnam, pakistan or russia).	look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice.	sarc

i don't think it's fair to put the blame on women who wear explicit clothing. there are times when self control is needed. if a man can't exercise that self control, to a point where he rapes a woman, then he does deserve jail.  this is partly right though, women do cause a lot of mixed messages when they go out wearing almost nothing. however, if she says no... it means no. and we shouldn't go around blaming the victim of a sexual assault.	dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views..	notsarc

not at all, it's just that other posters that often agree with you in just about every way want to call themselves conservatives (they've called clinton a conservative, bush a liberal, etc.) so it does get difficult to sort it all out sometimes.	it is only difficult to sort out if you are a neocon and fail to recognize that neocons are nothing but militant liberals.   bush was by far the most liberal president we have had for at least 20 years.   maybe you need to research traditional conservative values.	sarc
honest. what can i say? if nothing else the bush presidency has shown us that having a president who lies every time he opens his mouth is a bad thing.  she does not have enough background to say for sure. while she has instituted some conservative programs in alaska, she also championed the biggest social giveaway of any state ever. she did not even hide it...jsut taxed the oil companies and gave the cash to the people. that is about as socialist as you get.  cant say for sure on nancy pelosi. she looks like a half trained shimp next to hillary. hillary clinton may be evil,but she is smart.	and bill clinton didn't? obama doesn't? emoticonxdonno let me help you with that. emoticonxangel she's a conservative! i'll bet her upcoming debate with biden will get far more attention than mccain/obama did! i'll sure be watching! word has it that the moderator is an obama lover.  i'm just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted, personality contests. just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits doesn't mean he/she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions.  looks aside, pelosi's a dingbat compared to palin. she gets a free pass from the news media - ho hum.	sarc
well, this comes from the same people who invented the death pannels. the truth is that all the developed countries (all of europe, canada, japan, australia, new zealand, taiwan, israel) have universal healthcare. their cost per capita is about half of ours. they have better outcomes.universal healthcare has been tried in many places and it does work. what does not work is our current system. wellpoint has just increased premiums by 30% even wiyhout a reform bill. they spend 30% on administrative costs.btw, do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative costs to 20%?	now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?	sarc
well, my views are probably shaded by my anger of religion, after being under its influence for all of my childhood and a better part of my adult life.  i'm going to get on board my pontoon boat on this beautiful 70 degree autumn day and float out on the lake and ponder. maybe a more reasoned perspective can be found at the lapping of the waves below and in the intense blue sky above.	well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits.	notsarc
look over the heller ruling again. all nine judges agreed unanimously that the second amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. the only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.	stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. so was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? is this some kind of hybrid model? interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. but i suppose it sounds good to say that all nine supreme court justices supported an individual rights interpretation. 	notsarc
islam is very clear that mohammed received the quran from an angel. not god. as you may or may not know, satan is a fallen angel and islam is his religion which is proven by the hate, murder and death that it was built upon and has lived by since its founding.	islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage.	notsarc
i am trying to show that in fact the crime rate is increasing, not that there is more than a change in how it is reported. around here (my home county) we are doing much better.	no, i think you're trying to do more than that. you're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   what, no actual data to back up any of your claims? do you have access to us crime numbers? how many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? that's the comparison that needs to be made here.	notsarc

"anti-choicers don't give two whits about life, or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus. this story is a good example of that. i bet a lot of so-called ""pro-lifers"" would support this court's decision, even though the mother posed no real threat, and she could have miscarried the fetus:for anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. they don't care about life. (except their own.)this same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. they wouldn't defend that right either.because they don't care about the fetus. they don't care about life. they don't care about health. they care about power and money and pushing people around. that's all."	that's quite a leap, even for you. how did you know that the officiers were pro-life? or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.   i certainly think it was excessive. i guess i must not be pro-life by your illogic.	sarc

the death penalty assures that an incorragable criminal never has the opportunity to kill anybody else. in prison, the criminal could a) kill another inmate, 2) kill a guard, 3) escape and kill a civilian, 4) have their sentence commuted and get out to commit another crime. quote:would you agree if the death penalty was banned?no, for the reasons stated above and one more. some people don't deserve to live....like sh, for example.__________________true , gang members put in prison often kill other opposing gang members in prison so that is true. they also get put in prison and are proud some of them , gang leaders consider it a mark of honor something some of them getting caught by the 'fuzz' and put in jail. who are we to decide who is to live? what makes us so much better? hitler didnt deserve to live but that does not give us the right to kill him.i agree with shooter and proud but hey heres a situation, why don't we give murderers fates to the ones most hurt by their crime, and rapists fates are decided by the ones t hey rape. they would know the best. if the ones raped are too young such as under maybe 10 or are like seven or its a loved one and they can't seperate justice from love, then the case be decided by law. give them the chance to live in solitary confinement, give them the chance, we can always take it away. but those killed don't get no more chances. in prison if they do kill put them in confinement. same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine. but gang murders should be different, if someone is in jail for killing a gang member in a fight or something like that , it is murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it is if they shot a four year old in the head for being related to someone in an opposing gang. then its wrong flat out, solitary or death penalty. personally id be for giving them death penalty for anyone who would do that. but i have two three year old cousins who i love to death and would kill anyone who harmed them so i do not want anyone to get away with killing kids. child killers are some of the worst criminals there are.	so, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. you just want it used judiciously? same here. where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously.	notsarc

according to this year's fbi uniform crime report, the use of guns in crime rose significantly from 1985 to 1993. however, since implementation of the brady law in february 1994, there has been a significant drop in the percentage of violent crimes committed with a firearm. a study by the brady center to prevent gun violence showed that, since it's enactment, the brady law background check kept handguns out of the hands of over 312,000 prohibited purchasers - including 113 felons a day.http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r...h/bradyred.asp	sounds like the brady law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.	notsarc
ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. there was no real biological basis for the prejudice. we know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. you are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. this is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. this trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold.	yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?	notsarc

"each side tries to support their own worldview. there are two positions, and sides are chosen. it's human nature. yes. :) i can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the bible suggests, but i don't believe in doing it in a forceable way. i don't believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once, it takes a combination of many tiny little steps (examples) to win converts. my main reason for posting here is political. i don't believe it's possible to have neutrality in government. if church & state are separated, atheism and state are combined. atheism almost always equals secular ""progression"", and judeo christianity almost always equals tradition, according to unchanging biblical morals. the two quickly clash in politics. also, i don't believe future generations (school children) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough. i enjoy written debates very much, and i'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the u.s. government, in violation of the text of the first amendment and intent of the framers. i believe there has to be a god because i see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals.i was brought up without anyone forcing me what to believe, and went to church occasionally. my church attendance didn't get very regular until my late twenties - about twenty years ago. a few bible studies, comparing it to the flow of events, the nature of people, my shortcomings, the shortcomings of science etc, convinced me. though it doesn't really say why, the bible says that is what will happen. see matthew 7 :13,14. it's part of god's plan. free will."	very well said, but remember, evolution doesnt mean atheism, but creationism means religion. i know christians that believe in evolution, but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism.	notsarc

it's called a technical correction, and if you had any knowledge about these things you would know this. all commodities and equities have gone up substantially over the last year and a correction was in order. oil broke through a 5 year old resistance line a while back and that usually means that the price is going down even further. i expect oil to be heading towards the mid 40's before going up again after the opec production cut at the end of the month. and if you think that inflation has no effect on the price of oil or any other commodity/stock, then you're either ignorant, stupid or both. inflation affects the price of everything on this planet.

i am speaking of the christian church. no offense to folks of other faiths. i am simply interested in what folks of any faith would say to this.  as a protestant, i would say the purpose of the church is to 'be jesus to the world'. individuals within the church are to use their god given gifts for the building up of the body to love one another and show the world what love is. any other thoughts, (or similar thoughts). remember we are looking at what ought not what is.	by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god.	notsarc
and yet you continue to support the illogic of a potential person having the right to make a slave of a person in being. incredible. and, yes, if i am in a persistent vegetative state, i have authorized my family to direct my physicians to pull the plug. i'm not there.	what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno  	sarc
a fairer comparison for science as a whole would be the inner way of thinking and knowing, as contrasted to that based on external empiricism. i think that has far more staying power.	but it took a lot longer to develop. my point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. what we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. before that it was ok to do science like aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.but science is more than an inner way of thinking. it is a process and a method for learning about the universe. it is called methodological naturalism. that is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. it says that science can't study the supernatural.	notsarc

"there is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the ""right to keep and bear arms"". this is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. > (1) the second amendment to the u.s. constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. none of the provisions of the constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. they recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. such rights were considered by many of the framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of locke, montesquieu, rousseau, madison, hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the bill of rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. that has turned out to have been a good idea > (2) the right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. this was clearly the understanding and intent of the framers of the u.s. constitution and was a long-established principle of english common law at the time the constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written constitution."	so please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the government violated the supreme law of the land and made all guns illegal?but i do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite the bill of rights says and what the supreme court proved was the correct meaning!	notsarc
"in the quote which you referenced, the bottom line was ""the point at which we assign rights is a matter of opinion."" that is part of what we are debating in the abortion debate.however, unlike the term person or the ideas about when rights begin, the term genocide is not a matter of opinion and it does have a very specific definitive meaning, as defined in the definitions posted over the last few pages. i say that your claim of abortion being genocide is untrue and unsupported by logical arguement. it does not match that definition. you are the one who are spouting the importance of being definitive, yet the only support that you have given is gross distortions of the actual definition."	it is supported, i have shown that it is true. your only argument is to claim that organisations that perpetrate genocide don't agree that it is genocide. wow what an argument you have.  	sarc

with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species wouldn't the old species not exist any more?	no, say you've got 200 of some species. by some event, 100 member are seperated. now we have two groups of 100. each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. that doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.	notsarc

the criminalization of abortion was the real abuse of power. it was mostly done by a few sexist and political oppertunist members of the ama to stop women from practicing medicine and by xenophobic/racist protestant groups who feared a non-white/non-protestant majority here in america after the civil war cleared out many of them.	so the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. there was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. it was all about how they could keep women down. tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?	notsarc

no, your idea about science is a philiosophy of science. sure, it's got a lot of believers, but historically it is not the only vision of science people have believed in.there is metaphysical evidence. the apostles saw jesus walk on water. there was no 'measure' by your version of science, but what they saw remains true.	"people have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions. many people once believed that the earth is flat:perhaps some still do. but this has nothing to do with scientific truth.there is no ""version"" of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities.by definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. any law, knowledge, etc. thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account. all science in this sense is provisional.the apostles may have believed that jesus walked on water: that does notmake it true."	notsarc

there has been. there's been a lot of grumbling in congress and among the people more to the right of the scale.  by saying he still had support i assumed you meant you thought it was somehow shifting to the democrats... my mistaken assumption.	there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic).	notsarc

when one turns the other cheek in the biblical sense, they neither utilize the inside of their mouth, nor do they revolve or rotate the inside of it. at least not here in the usa. since you're in canada, i can't speak for you. but for anyone to actually argue that penfold used clearly descriptive language in getting his point across, proves that you all are either too ignorant to know any better, or you're just taking this stance in order to stand against me. or both which i suspect it to be, myself. but thanks for chiming in and proving that you are but another lemming in a long line of them here at 4forums.	are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear.	sarc

we now still have light and dark moths. the only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*.	exactly. that the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by j.w. tutt. the funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.	notsarc

why? because police cars attached to the washington mpd's civil disturbance unit had escorted the seiu protesters' buses to baer's home. such cross-jurisdictional escort activity is not uncommon for both departments according to friz and metro police department spokesperson officer eric frost. still, the district police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their maryland neighborhoods.	so cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. you will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.	sarc

folks should be aware that every state in the united states except florida allows gay people to adopt as single parents. the issue comes in many states when a same-sex spouse tries to adopt as a second parent. some states permit this and some states do not. it's weird indeed that all states except one allow single gay people to adopt children, but many do not allow gay couples to be adoptive parents together. it makes no sense to me, since two parents are usually better than one.	does the sexual orientation of the would-be single parent even come up?	notsarc
i think he examined her record and the information by which some other doctor pronounced her pvs, noting that one or more criteria for establishment of that diagnosis was missing. i'm not arguing the case for him, i'm just saying she should be fed until this is proved wrong. the doctor is supposed to be quite an eminent member of his filed of study and may actually know what he is talking about.	examined the record? now it's not even the patient, just the record? good god man! many times, only a number of criteria must be met, not all of them. it would be like me saying that there must be gas in your car since it is running. then you tell me that i must look at the gauge then physically take the tank off to be able to say without a doubt there is gas in it. flat eeg in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means pvs. there is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.   	sarc

this guy has been debating me for almost a year now...i thought i would share one of his post with you. what do you guys think? the pictures did not come out...sorry about that.

if so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?	1 - it is innacurate. we allow killing in times of war, in self defense, and in state sanctioned executions. so we already have a situation where, when given x mitigating factors, it is justifiable to take a life. it is impossible to say all life is equal, and then to apply that as law. people will be outraged. i know i would be.2 - objective to who? who gets to decide how valuable life is? and why should they get to? and who says they are right? the relative value of life works fine, thanks very much.	notsarc
it is kind of funny how abortion has to do with a woman's body. and yet, if it was left up to the state: congress: women hold 81, or 15.1%, of the 535 seats in the 109th us congress  14, or 14.0%, of the 100 seats in the senate and 67, or 15.4%, of the 435 seats in the house of representatives. in addition, three women serve as delegates to the house from guam, the virgin islands and washington, dc. only 15.1%... so that means that 276 men (51 senate/ 225 congress) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women's body...and if its something that could be bad for a woman and/or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators/representatives needed to supress it.... [66.6666-15.1 = 51.56666--(535/100)(51.56666)=276]  (http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/of...rs/cawpfs.html)	i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented. 	sarc
no doubt that people who are determined to be anti-bush will always try and find something wrong with it, but i think bush's speech last night was very good. he was confident, poised, the speech had substance and specifics, and he showed once again that he's a better orator than he's given credit for. even a number of democrats complemeted it. only the hardest people would not be touched by the iraqi woman who's husband was killed by saddam's intel, embracing the mother of a fallen soldier. a lot of people got teary at that unstaged moment, including the president himself. kind of put the whole thing in perspective.	is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers.	notsarc
are you refering to japan or some hypothetical police state?	a little of both. japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation. suspects aren't allowed to read confessions before signing them either.is that what penfold really wants?	notsarc
then your argument too is flawed by the same principals of debate.	because? the conventional big bang is just as unlikely as god. therefore your claim is wrong.   however the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. there is no end and there is no beginning.   you are out of your league.	notsarc
rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. the life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.the reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.	"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. if you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes."	notsarc

anyhow, i have no problems with the archaeopteryx. it was an interesting creature, but simply having features present from two different forms (bird and dinosaur) doesn't mean it is a link?	"yes, you do have a problem with archaeopteryx. you can't explain it from a creationist point of view. i'm not claiming that it is a ""link,"" whatever that may be. it is a transitional form. it is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. it also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. some characteristics exist in both. the furcula, for example. a furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. an indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. archaeopteryx has a furcula. but even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. it is intermediate. imagine that!"	notsarc

i'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. with guns criminals can do even more damage. adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. if you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the us then you need to do more research.	you are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument galileo, and by this i mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. we agree that criminals shouldn't be armed, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. but your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. it is that premise which we are fighting against through the nra and other lobbying efforts.	sarc

"now we come to the problem with the ""theory"" of intelligent design. there simply has been no thinking involved. the equivalent of id is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, ""well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that? we should teach them that this is a valid alternative to gravity."" i also offer you this for humor: http://www.venganza.org/"	"that's not the equivalent of id - you're mixing causes & effects. the theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and id proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. your ""apple falling"" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. other scientific subjects aren't that simple.

look, i lost my response; i'm not going to retype it because in hindsight i was just repeating the same thing: you and i both know the issue is the morality of the act, choice is meaningless because all the law is, is the use of force to prevent (or prevent further) immoral choices. me condemning something as immoral is the same as advocating it be outlawed which is the exact same 'making a decision' as telling someone that just because they can kill others doesn't mean it's their choice. the high dollar question is whether the fetus is human, biologically it is; not at the time all that a human can be but none of us ever achieve that. you said you are concentrating on 9 months, i don't see a difference you can abort child rearing just as easily after birth by killing the child or abandoning it.	i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another.	notsarc

i think this is unlikely under the current makeup of the supreme court. but that of course is the fear that many have, i.e., that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat (whether at the state or federal level) rather than through legislative means.	"well, let's be honest here. people fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. that's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. there was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, oregon i think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. so it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. ""judicial fiat"" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals."	notsarc

nope, you've still missed the point. bolding your repetition won't help, either. you said 'all visiting moslems'. not 'all visiting individuals'. specifically investigating 'all visiting moslems' is discriminatory. investigating 'all visiting individuals' is not - well, it is a bit, but less so - and you would not have got this response if you had suggested as such.	since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes	sarc

"""the delaware department of justice initially insisted to the news that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. yesterday, a spokeswoman for the delaware department of justice said it misinterpreted the law and that brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm."	form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? warning: you are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. if you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.sarah brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the nics check red flagging him. by gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.	notsarc

i read an article yesterday (about evolution, extinction, and economics) in which it was claimed that 99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct.this sort of claim (which i've come across before) troubles me: how can it be asserted, with any certainty at all:1). the number of species which have evolved.2). the percentage of that number that have become extinct.????	i believe it is merely all known living species against those known by the fossil record and extinct. there are undoubtedly more extinct species that we are unaware of than living ones.	notsarc
again, what is this 'social support' you think the govt. provides, exactly? be specific please. simple question. no, the constitutional amendment doesn't address a cultural context. it would keep you from getting the federal benefits--the legal context.	marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence.	notsarc
ok, no one said that i would look to a large govt for anything.  if individuals are better suited to solve environmental problems, i'd love to hear some of these solutions. this is why i started this thread, because the info out there is far from satisfactory. can you please explain how private individuals would, say, reduce co2 emissions from automobiles? or, maybe, protect an area that has been deemed a toxic waste dump from leaking toxins into the soil? or protect a certain species of bird or marsupial (some forest-dwelling creature) from having his habitat destroyed by logging, endangering the survival of the species? can you offer any libertarian solutions to the other problems i cited above?	you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary.	notsarc

however one thing that works against evolution is this. it is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.	"almost all did. in fact, probably all that you are aware of did. even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. the thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. and what energy is left by ""higher"" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. that even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved."	notsarc

the problem, however, becomes more manageable once you realize that all you need is a computer with a database that shows where all the food/water hoarders live. no such database exists, to the best of my knowledge; certainly not one we could gain access to. and in any event, post-apocalypse technology will be limited to things that operate without electricity, for the most part, so maintaining and powering a computer after the end of the world would be pretty much impossible. i think you need to take your plan back to the drawing board, as it all hinges on this one ill conceived idea.  also, even if your computer idea worked and was a reality, you just told a whole bunch of people about it, so now you have unwanted competition.	hmmmm..., unwanted competition...., i guess you are all on that database then ;)	notsarc

prominent conservative j. harvie wilkinson of the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals compared heller to roe v. wade and criticized it for its lack of adherence to conservative methodology: 'heller represents a triumph for conservative lawyers. but it also represents a failure - the court's failure to adhere to a conservative judicial methodology in reaching its decision. in fact, heller encourages americans to do what conservative jurists warned for years they should not do: bypass the ballot and seek to press their political agenda in the courts.' ssrn-of guns, abortions, and the unraveling rule of law by j. wilkinson  supreme court justice stevens also made a similar criticism.

some argue that the mountains weren't that tall yet. that makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. plates move at 1 inch a year. that's 500 feet over 6,000 years. everest is by far taller then that. some argue that plates moved faster. to create everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. while plate movements are related to the earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. that's way more then the surface of the sun.	"but even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. the heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. add to that the fact that the condensation of the ""vapor canopy"" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth.

you cannot mandate biology. the fact of the matter is, however, that homosexual relationships, themselves, appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose. without effects on the female line, this aberration (for lack of a better word) would have bred itself out of the population long ago. it would be similar to a subset of the population in an animal species suddenly being attracted to another, separate animal species. it would seem to serve no positive purpose. procreation is a positive, useful purpose to any activity in an evolutionary context. sexual attraction exists to facilitate procreation. pleasure during sex exists to facilitate procreation. homosexual individuals have brains that co-opt specific biological functions to substitute creatures that do not facilitate the purpose they evolved to involve.	humans don't just have sex for procreation. humans have sex for pleasure. that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis.	notsarc

atheism is not a belief in the typical sense. it is a non-belief. it is the abscence of belief.  a theist is one who beleives in one form of a diety or another.  the prefix 'a' means without. thus an atheist is one without a beleif in one form of a diety or another. as to the idea of your question my non beleif comes from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what is meant by 'god'.	i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic.	notsarc
well, apparently the above 3 posters think iraq and the causes of said war are the most important thing to worry about. sad, but i think they missed your point.  i don't see it as what issues is america facing, but what issues are the individual american people facing. in my opinion, the issues most important to the individual person are the same as they have been for thousands of years. food, shelter, security from people and things trying to kill them, and their individual means to obtain these things. just a thought.	do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit.	notsarc

so says the offspring of islam.....still wrong but vehement in his certitude. sheer bluster and effrontery does nothing to counter jo's calm and factual comments.	which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation.	notsarc
i know more about human nature than you do. i'm beginning to not see much point in continuing this argument with you either, because you just can't seem to understand the fact that mr. horn wasn't found guilty of any wrongdoing. if you don't like it, take it up with the grand jury. maybe this is good publicity; don't come to texas if you have plans to be a criminal otherwise you'll get shot and the person you tried to rob will be hailed as a hero. that's the kind of message we need to be spreading; be a criminal and die like a dog.	based on what? i never said mr. horn did anything legally wrong. he was well within the rights of the state of texas. i never argued otherwise. that doesn't change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men, which is the topic of the discussion at hand.	notsarc

and again, it was only written that way in that era to limit the federal government from making laws that give preference to one religion or another; i.e. anothers persons faith could not receive preferential treatment over your own. the 14th amendment further says that the states cannot pass any laws the abridge the rights you have as a federal citizen so a state cannot pass a law either that gives preference to a different faith than your own, the same limitation as the federal government.	if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?	notsarc

ok according to the bible god only created the first two beings, adam and eve. now christians dont rule out science, and science has shown that we produce offspring. god has created these offspring but not directly. think of photosynthesis, we eat meat, this is getting energy from the sun indirectly. so we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by god to produce offspring. as far as your question on why god alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this. we where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict, wrong put we have the choice. god created us to have that choice, or else we would be robots. the bible also says god knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby. god can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices.	so god already knows if a particular person will become an addict? that doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? if i go to a restaurant and god already knows i'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then i don't have much choice in the matter, do i? omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. if god is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.unless of course, god is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. but then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. sounds like a loose / loose situation to me.	notsarc

the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. it took weeks for rescue workers to water-cool the glowing steel beneath the wreckage at ground zero. it was clearly and prominently visible in a thermal image taken by a usgs satellite on september 16--five days later. in the video, one of the workers states that it has been almost 6 weeks after the attacks, and workers are still trying to cool down the steel. the 9/11 commission and supporters of the official story don't try to make the claim that office fires produce molten steel. they just ignore it.	the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. the 9/11 commission omitted it because...??? what is this deep dark secret they don't want the american public to know? which, according to you is easily figured out anyway.

since we already had one example of a creationist lowlife tactic in the george gaylord simpson quote, i decided to skim the site and see if i could find another. i did. gee, gives the impression that dr. david m. raup, curator of geology, museum of natural history, chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely one's belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific. but that's not at all what dr. raup was stating. while googling for a fuller quote, i ran across a page that showed how this – and many other – statements by dr. raup were distorted by creationists.  to start with, here is a fuller quote: the page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to dr. raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a creationist journal (one of the quotes being the one being addressed here). of course dr. raup's reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record, nor evolution, nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution. the page also lists numerous other creationist distortions of dr. raup's statements.	don't you think this would fit the 'creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? although i notice the skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have.	notsarc

atheists are clearly capable of all of these, but if human beings are just collections of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them?	so atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.	sarc

to ss, results from new mutations are by definition different from the normal, so your objection makes no sense. no one is disputing that there are serious negative side effects with the sickle cell trait. however, in terms of the reproductive success of families with sickle cell vs those without, the ones with the trait do better overall than the ones without, in areas severely beset with malaria and in times before medicine, despite the negative effects. the positives outweigh the negatives, so the sickle cell trait is therefore beneficial in terms of natural selection.	i'm referring to chemist's assertion that mutations cause a beneficial modification to the morphology of hemoglobin. my two links say the hemoglobin becomes 'abnormal,' thus his example fails.  and you are assuming that this mutation is random. why? cancer mutations are not random...they are lead up to by epigenetic changes. why not this? http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-nvo122105.php	notsarc

why are there so many people that express interest in who i love? (a rhetorical question) why are there so many people that express interest in how i love? (also a rhetorical question) with all of the atrocities in this country and the world, it seems so odd that politicians and those of 'religion,' as well as the public in general, are so interested in our personal lives. why can't the politicians and those of 'religion' and the public in general place their interest in the atrocities?  and to negate an expected reply, who i love and how i love is not an atrocity in any way.	see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian.	notsarc
then surely you can't explain away why enzyme a and co-enzyme b are separate compounds but work together to produce another by-product.	well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. first, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. this is the way evolution works. nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. again, this was refined by natural selection over time. in the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. and do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. if you don't know how, i'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.	notsarc

i do believe that the predictions are accurate, but i say 'no' for two reasons: one, stopping the event would create a paradox. since the event is stopped, it never happens. if it never happened, then nostradamus never predicted it. the second reason is, in the prediction that correlated to 9-11, skeptics asked why they couldn't stop the incendent. along with point one, i say to them 'how do you know that somebody didn't go to authorities on 9-10-01, and say 'there's gonna be a terrorist attack tomorrow''? if someone cited a cryptic writing dating back centuries as evidence, they would either be laughed at and dismissed, or sent to a mental hospital. edit: sorry about forgetting the poll. i remembered that just as i hit the submit button. i'm half asleep today.	...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers.	notsarc

science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out. the best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.	exactly. trying to prove that god, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the god debate. i could always debate that since god is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. if he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. this would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. but even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.	notsarc

anyone who suggests abortion is a dispute between the rights of a woman and a fetus is trying to mislead you or is negligent about the nature of abortion rights. this isn't a dispute between woman vrs fetus but instead an issue between a woman's right to abortion and the interests of a small yet powerful vocal minority who believe they can project their views upon the majority. rights are not simply just passed out but are based upon interest…something the supreme court based their conclusion during roe v wade. in the many years that have supported abortion rights i have never found a single pro-lifer who could prove, outside their opinion and others, how a fetus has an interest in being born. unfortunately for them, fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa. the pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus, at the moment of conception, has an interest in living. so the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs. women have a right to abortion because, as a nation, we have an invested interest in keeping abortion legal for them. for nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoff…they lead to the corruption of law enforcement, provide criminals another avenue of wealth, wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women, destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place. fetuses are immune from having an self-interest in being born because they have never developed such feelings in the sheer majority of abortion ever performed. their brains are often far too primitive to hold such emotions or even awareness. if the fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then what is the big deal? considering abortion was more legal during the times of our founding fathers then today.	tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? what about someone in a coma?	sarc

i will not turn this into another debate that often comes up with this issue. but for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the rights of the being's inside the mother are being infringed upon? that is, when do you deem it worthy of protection? (i won't debate this, i'm just curious as to your view).	actually, i am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. by granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. yes, i believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and i'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. yes, i think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.	notsarc

well you can thank god for that then, because what you were proposing for single payer was some of the most ridiculous stupidity i'd ever seen. whenever anyone wanted to discuss it rationally you'd just spam the boards with another petition '72% of single mothers support single payer! 84% of single mothers reject raising taxes to pay for single payer! therefore we should go single payer!' i even recall you once berated steve for arguing in his own words instead of linking to a poll to support him. why do you think those numbers are relevant? popularity isn't a magic power that turns bad policy into good.	if i'm spamming a petition, then you're spamming paul krugman, darling. and i've put up plenty of rational arguments with citations. you, on the other hand, have yet to propose one reason why single payer is ridiculous. because we elect representatives to do what we say, not what the lobbyists bribe them to do. you still haven't said anything besides 'stupid', 'ridiculous', and 'maoist' or 'socialist', which is usually what people say about the few politicians who aren't on the take. emoticonxgood	notsarc

of course it will have an effect on the gay marriage issue. it will prevent the people of mass from voting on the issue and place the final decision in the hands of the pro gay democratic legislature who is owned and controlled by the gay lobby. it should also be noted that according to the mass constitution, the people have always voted on such issues. the democratic party controlled government wants to change the constitution against the will of the people who want to vote on this important issue.it's just another example of the liberals hijacking the historical political process and reforming it in their own image.	but if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. you are a rightwing hypocrite, archie baby.	sarc

you agreed with trebor pappy.....now you are back pedalling..re previous post	yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own.	sarc
wow, in one fell swoop you completely destroyed my faith in god. in 109 words you awakened me from 32 years of religious delusions. not!!!	i can understand your disappointment. its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. no easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim. but if you really work hard at it for another decade or so you may recover yet. best of luck and don't fall for the quacks peddling quick cures.	sarc
"i have been reading some of the replies on this page, and yes there is a very new valid way that creationists can explain the fact that we see stars that are billions of light years away in a universe that is thousands of years old. this problem is appearently solved by dr russell humphreys new ""relativistic cosmology"" in which he out lines in the book ""starlight and time."""	hello, please read http://www.reasons.org/resources/apo...ing.shtml?mainit is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with dr russell humphreys' hypothesis.the universe and earth are very old. we know this as a fact. why would god lie to us? if the universe looks old, then it is. to claim otherwise is to call god a liar.	notsarc

no i do not think that all life comes from a single-celled ancestor in the distant past. the first reason for this is my faith in the inherent word of god. secondly, throughout my college education (majoring in molecular biology) i have observed the complexities of the single-cell, and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident (though that may not be the best choice of words). the more and more we learn about cellular structure, the more complex we find it is and how these complexities are required in order for life to be present at all.	so, faith and argument from incredulity.   if you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. then maybe an actual scientist could take over.  major in molecular biology? not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.	sarc

considering that there's little new information and reasoning in any of these debates, i find it surprising that they keep coming up.	i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.	notsarc

the difference, and i think it is a significant difference, is that omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm. i believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks. nor does it require being stupidly fearless. we all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day. to me, the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable. the intent of my opening post was to find out why omegamon and others feel differently.	"because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. the only ones who tend to ask ""why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself"" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position."	sarc

this is directly from their website: thousands did not die, this number was known to be made up.  see... http://www.catholic.net/rcc/loveboth/chapter27.html http://www.factcheck.org/article336.html the number of illegal abortions is also overstated...some estimate it is only around 100,000...considering 1973 only had around 800,000 abortions it doen't seem likely that a year before 1million were done illegally.	based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not.	notsarc

if you think evolution cannot explain any change then why pick the avian lung in particular? maybe try and show how genesis can integrate almost or more observations in a meaningful way than evolution, then genesis competes, otherwise it does not.	because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. is that what you mean?genesis says that all creatures were specially created. it fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.statis is the norm not the exception.one is right the other wrong. it cannot be both ways.do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?	notsarc

if i would have been alive 100 years ago, would i have opposed having evolution taught in schools? of course i would have, because i wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance.	"again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. please show me where it is anything than a belief. evolution was always considered science. it used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. until the ""theory"" of intelligent design does that, i will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief."	notsarc

yeah, there are those who scream that self-defence is not a valid reason for gun ownership. there were no valid reasons until the libs thought them up, but i'll set that aside for now. the question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership. i don't forsee any stats posted, as this thread has nothing to do with crime. so this is a chance for you to work on debating skills.	i think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   while i have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, i own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   a humorus side note: i own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in alaska) to shoot large halibut before bringing them aboard.	notsarc

even though florida's mckay voucher program was specifically created for students with disabilities, the law is structured in a way that penalizes middle- and low-income parents who cannot afford to pay tuition or fees that typically exceed the voucher's face value. additionally, participating private schools are not required to offer special education services and even those that do offer these services are not required—unlike public schools—to monitor students' progress.147	crouching libertarian, hidden cost. can't pay extra expenditures get's ya penalized! no special education requirements (they are't unders state or federal control!) no requirement to moniter student progress...that seems safe.	sarc

and, of course, you totally miss the point.the point is that a 1-day-old infant can be cared for by anybody! it is no longer dependent upon the body and resources of only one person.but, of course, if that one person is only a lowly, less than human woman, that lowly person has absolutely no rights to compare with that of the almighty, holy fetus.	it can't always be cared by anyone. what if no one wants the baby or you can't get to a place where you can give the baby up (maybe snowed in for a week). can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you.	notsarc

i disagree. well maybe technically. let's look at it this way. criminals' access to guns may even go slightly up, because there are some criminals who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally. but the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals, thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun. criminals may forget getting a gun anyway so maybe indirectly, but the major problem is access to guns, not ownership of guns. access will go up, no one disputes that, but people using them for self-defense goes much higher so that more than makes up for the increase in access for criminals. make sense?	yes, but i think you missed my point. i stated this above, remember the prohabition? people actually drank more alchohal. without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.	notsarc

"within the community of christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret holy scripture. while virtually all christians take the bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the bible literally, as they would a science textbook. many of the beloved stories found in the bible – the creation, adam and eve, noah and the ark – convey timeless truths about god, human beings, and the proper relationship between creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.we the undersigned, christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. we believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. to reject this truth or to treat it as ""one theory among others"" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. we believe that among god's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our creator. to argue that god's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the god-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit god, an act of hubris. we urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. we ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth."	over 10,000 signatures of christian clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.	notsarc
the problem is that you have wack jobs and zealots on both sides of the issue. on the one hand, you have the yec/creationist crowd. some fo them go off the deep end when you suggest anything but a literal interpetationof genisis. on the other side, you have the evolutionaist crowd, who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue.	but religion is not a topic for science classes. teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. what is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative.	sarc
the areas of america where divorce rates are highest are also frequently the areas where many conservative christians live. kentucky, mississippi and arkansas voted overwhelmingly for constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage. but they had three of the highest divorce rates in 2003, based on figures from the census bureau and the national center for health statistics.http://www.sunherald.com/mld/thesunh...d/10179154.htm	you know, i heard that from my mom last week. my parents moved to arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have. ironic indeed.	notsarc
i doubt it. a story on the news today. those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder and are more likely to die from suicide. interesting.	sucide? isn't that a mental health issue? if you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   if it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   if it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide.	notsarc
"the second amendment says, ...

i believe dametel is referring to leviticus 20:13 - 'if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.' dametel hasn't discovered yet that in the new testament it is god who exercises this type of punishment when he deems fit, instead of man.	how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!	notsarc

my point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a someone.	sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. it seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.	notsarc

your position, it seems to me, turns on issues of quality of life and social justice such that children are entitled to either a minimum quality of life or none at all, and that preserving a woman's right to control over her body is necessary for her quality of life as an equal citizen.	i do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the united states.	notsarc

"can anyone make a rational argument as to why executing a criminal who was 18 years old when committing the crime is not ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" but executing a criminal who was less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual?put another way, can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime, but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime?participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty, in general, is constitutional. this has been the case from the beginning of our republic, and has been reaffirmed multiple times. in other words, it is not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty, in general, is unconstitutional. that has neither been the case through our history, and is not the current state of the law.*note: i am speaking within the context of the united states, and its constitution."	i think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. if we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). we don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.	notsarc

single payer would give you a lot less government. though border control certainly takes more. still, 'more government' or 'less government' -- this vague phrase you keep throwing out -- is not the point. the point is cost-effective health care for all americans and the integrity of our national borders, and all that goes with it. i would agree with that. don't know the writer, but i agree, it's revolting c**p. mexico is a very racist society in many ways.	perhaps you should smoke a lot less crack? funny isn't it how the people who say that invariably want a larger government? btw adam smith, aka 'miguel sanchez', is a prominent mexican free market economist and spiritual leader of the latino pride movement, with suspected ties to people smuggling and drug trafficking operations along the californian border. his magnum opus the wealth of mexicans details an insidious plot to bring down racial equality through free market principles, estabilishing a millenium of full spectrum mexican dominance of the american financial, legal and industrial systems. the only barrier to his evil plot? patriotic americans who understand the benefits of government control in all aspects of their lives. i'm surprised someone as educated on such a diverse array of issues as yourself hasn't come across him.	sarc

how about: a woman wakes up to find herself connected to a body. a body without a brain, which is using her own organs to be alive. doctors are preparing to transplant a brain from a dying violinist into this new one connected to her and the date is set in the future. would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity, mind, consciousness or existence in actuality?	yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. however, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).	notsarc
what do you think is motivating these scientists to lie to us?	i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story. 	notsarc

not all reform jews are liberals either. i know more than a few conservative reform jews. also there are fundamentalists of every christian denomination, i've even spoken to people who've encountered fundamentalist anglicans. :p orthodox judaism, as i understand it, attempts to perpetuate the same system of law as was delivered by moses, and more specifically the associated traditions of the last 3-4 millnenia. fundamentalist protestantism, meanwhile, sets itself against the christian tradition, such as the priesthood, apostolic succession, the doctrine of transubstantiation, infant baptism. the point i'm making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian, nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect, and the same principle applies to reform judaism. that is the comparison i was making.	i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?	notsarc

the moral of that last story is: don't screw with baldy. that aside, where did god tell these folks to do what they did? just curious.	morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc).	notsarc

and in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.	it hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. by the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, i challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.	notsarc
from what i understand of christianity...you're gonna burn, buddy. sorry, but that's where i think you'd fall according to that. personally, i don't think so. i think if there is a god and it's anything like i picture, you'll be fine. question, what are the seven deadly sins you've committed?	but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm...	sarc

if it's a well reasoned one, yes. if it's yet another attempt to denigrate those who disagree with you by making absurd generalisations, then no. the attention seeking makes little sense as i rarely discuss my personal religious experiences because they are just that, personal, and because my telling people something will not be convincing to them, and hence serves no purpose. if you want to trivialise mental illness in order to belittle others then that's entirely your lookout. if you want i could reciprocate by pointing out how obsessive-compulsive your rants are.	rants? obsessive-compulsive? how so? i don't insult you with every post as you do me? what's you major problem? perhaps you need to go pray.	sarc
the last guy who owned the gun legally is a good place to start. if there's a stolen weapon report, so be it. if there's not, we investigate certainly and prosecute if the law allows. remember i support mandatory theft/loss reporting.	well then maybe you can prove it somehow. california has all these laws you support, and even more than that. so if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.	notsarc
"""one of the guns used at columbine was a tec-9, a semiautomatic handgun once specifically advertised by its manufacturer as the most popular crime weapon in america. the tec-9 was banned under president clinton's semiautomatic weapon order some years ago and is no longer made, but the ones that are still out there can be legally sold.""gun shows and columbinesame for north hollywood. the weapons were legally bought at a gun show by an acquaintance and transfered to the shooters. the shooters then easily modified several to full-auto."	so then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. you've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated.	notsarc
"just thought i'd share about secular rights for gays...not ""special rights"" but equal rights...no, homosexuals do not have the same rights as heterosexuals do. we cannot serve in the military because of our sexual orientation. we do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation.as for the secular rights, i don't think this is right.from a religious standpoint, i've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as i have on this board from some of the folks who are christians. personally, i don't see the difference between what is ""good"" and what is ""evil"" when it comes to religion on here. i've seen satanists say nicer things than what has been written here.if this is your idea of what is good, i want no part of it.as far as the two, secular rights and religious rights, it seems that although the constitution has a freedom of religion clause in it, faith based people cannot and will not separate the two out making the separation clause invalid...what's the point in that?"	i think they are doing it out of fear. they see the moral decline in america and they have latched onto the glbt community as their scapegoat. since it's no longer pc to attack african-americans for their obvious differences, it's not pc to go after other religions (especially judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.i mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around heterosexual sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. it's easier that way.	notsarc

you don't seem to want a written constitution either, or at least one that isn't as vauge as ours. i have gathered from your posts that you want a direct democracy, where everyone gets to vote on each others rights. you want the people to be able vote on such issues as abortion, and marriage, you want a tryanny of the majority. any one who wants people to be able to vote upon the civil rights of another is an enemy of freedom.	i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!	sarc

and what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if i may ask?i'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably don't pertain to you well, cause your not gay....	there are no objective reasons to condemn gays. marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.my advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me i have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes.	notsarc

at least with sport the best players are fairly easily identified, everyone can watch them in action and judge for themselves. with corporate officers it is much more ambiguous. there is no indication that firms are actually competing for the top talent, they just seem to be cycling around the same faces and awarding themselves ever larger pay rises.	does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no.	notsarc
this question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. this premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the united states. in the united states, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on x. i have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.	that's not exactly true now, is it? people get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. and of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. so in point of fact it is a true statement that in the united states someone is not allowed to vote on x, for some values of x.	notsarc

surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism. disproving one theory does not prove another. all it does is disprove a theory.	yes i do understand this. but you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the dna code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. there is evidence right there for creationism. only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation. 	notsarc

a chance mutation can do this by insertion. the codons for one protein are inserted or appended to the codons of of another. this is especially likely if the genes are near eachother. another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins. two proteins can fold such that they interact because of their shape. if the proteins interlock or attach, they can form new combined structures.	folding proteins... show me where and how this happens. why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another? if this is happening all the time we'd see more mutations all the time.good theory you've got there. saying something can happen doesn't mean that it does!	notsarc

of course it is known that wild animals that are sick just die from natural selection(they get eaten, or they don't manage to find food) and even livestock, if it has some disease, can be culled to prevent outbreak of disease. in humans it is different though, there are quarantine zones to prevent spread of certain disease. however, religion is sort of disease, but mind disease which can't be prevented to spread by some quarantine, but only by some great culling, and restricting it's spreading. religion is so embedded within (weak) human mind that it can't be removed normally(e.g. non violently, as those emotional weaklings would call it) but only by eradication.	i really hope you're joking. extremism is a disease, but not religion. religion can be, and is, for the most part, peaceful.	notsarc

volcanoes do more to contribute to global warming than an unchecked industrial society. toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture. molten rock isn't the most environmentally friendly substance you'll ever encounter.	so you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?the problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.it's something i see in a lot of conservatives.	sarc
most abortions are consentual, no one forced them to have consentual sex. so, instead of women taking accountability for their actions, they will force their views on another human being...die you sucker die. you are right, we need to stop forcing people. lets start with the mother shall we? emoticonxhoho	so since most abortions weren't rape, do you still support abortions for people who are raped? just wondering.	notsarc
why would god want a cowboy to spread his message? after all, cowboys have the stigma of being arrogant, stubborn, oblivious to subtle cultural traits, not the delicate cautious type, so and on so forth. seems like a bad vehicle for god.	because gc hears things all woggly. the message from god is for shepherds to tend to ignorant, mindless sheep. but, with dope-smoker ears, and american ignorance it translates into a cowboy...who rustles cattle...and heads them to a quick slaughter. it's like, when the anti-chist makes his appearance, i'll be gods slaughterman. effectively and efficiently removing tru-believahs from the world...cause god forgot some in his rapture thingy (i forget how the logic of these events is supposed to play out...) ummm...aren't we overdue for that bloke to return already? i'm getting antsy for the 2nd coming and all the excitement that leads up to that glorious event. think holding my breath will make it happen any sooner?	sarc
the fact that freedom of speech is still valid has nothing to do with this - the constitution doesn't rise and fall as one, or the concept of 'amendments' would not exist.	oh, really?   translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that i want to.	sarc
what amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates.	i know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.	notsarc
'-illegal war in iraq.' whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore! we are setting up a government for them! if they are grieving because we are helping the general public to live a more organized life then that's kind of their problem right?  besides; this isn't the debate topic where you should be bringing this up.

there was a catagory 5 hurricane back about 105 years ago that hit texas. as long as catagory 5 hurricans have been happening, it doesn't make sence that catagory 5s are created by a cold war device. now the fact that there is a hurricane in the pacific ocean (it's named a boys name that starts with the letter 'm'. hurricanes are not supposed to happen in the pacific ocean. the fact that a hurricane is in the pacific ocean when usually in the pacific ocean is a typhoon (and a cyclone over austrailia) suggest something odd. emoticonxwow	so, global warming no, but weather control devices, yes? perhaps too many people are playing red alert these days...	sarc
the fact that someone doesn't do or believe what he is selling doesn't affect the validity of the argument. there are teachers who don't believe in evolution, yet they teach it because it's standardized.	i'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn't even believe in what they're selling. those teachers may teach it, but they don't believe in it.	sarc
first thing i want to say is that i dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option. i also want to say that i love christ will all my heart. he has forgiven me for my sins and because ive had an abortion does not mean im not a christian and yes i was a christian when i did have an abortion. i had an abortion just this past june. ...i grew up in a christian home and was anti abortion most of my life but honestly i felt so relieved after having the abortion.	i am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you. i hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you.i must ask, though, why are you a christian? you completely disagree with typical christian sentiments on abortion, you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable, you feel like you did the right thing, so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day?	notsarc
we are talking about constitutional rights. in that case, even if you want to put religion into the mix. you really can't.	but behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality is and the morality of it. to many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.	notsarc
the purpose of hte bill of rights is to recognise certain pre-exisitng rights, but specifically not to curtail any that are not specifically recognised.	but still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.what debate are you trying to end here? the debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?	notsarc

that would have been alot differant then having intercourse, see that you are pregnant, and aborting it. at least if they decided to have intercourse later, i would still have had a chance to born.	no, you wouldn't have. i'd have a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket.	sarc
"both atheists and agnostics will tell you they see no evidence for the existence of any god. some will continue with ""thus, there is not one"" and other will continue with ""as for the other, i don't know"". the agnostic position is obviously tentative, however even though the atheist does not explicitly state his position is tentative, you will be hard pressed to find an atheist who states ""there is absolutely, positively, with out a doubt, no god at all""."	that distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. and that is what i was getting at originaly. still i think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.	notsarc
catholics have a different belief. the goal is to always save both mother and child. if the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. for instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.	you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise.	sarc
first great post i've seen in awhile with the truth attached!	his own drummer all right... you might say that the ot god has a bit of a problem upstairs...  funny you should mention lot's wife. lot's family are the sole survivors of the destruction of an entire city, for reasons which are debated. lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt just because she looked backwards as she was leaving- a natural human response. gen. 19:26 clearly states that she was behind lot. therefore in order to find out what happened to his wife, wouldn't he also had to have looked back? so, anyway, turning around gets you turned into a pillar of salt, but incest is a ok! it must be scary believing in such an inconsistant and crazy god...	sarc
and what a terrible threat those damn socialists have been. emoticonxrolleyes it's sad that so many americans still refuse to see that the greatest threat this country faces is itself.	oh, yea. you are damn right those european socialists are dangerous. americans might look and see their governments actually doing something useful for the people and think that we should have that here.  i am surprised we have not nuked them yet. 	sarc
no, it wouldn't. i suspect the manufacturer chose to stop participating because it didn't make economic sense. feel free to organize your own challenge to the consumer product safety laws of ca.	oh, how about the other states charge a special fee to inspect anything imported from kalifornia? seems like there was a little trade war going on over oj from florida and texas once and kalifornia lost.  what does the constitution of the u.s. say about powers prohibited to the states? reckon kalifornia is bound by the u.s. constitution? emoticonxagree	sarc

i'm wondering, tsmith, if you ever actually think about what you say or bother to learn before you speak. you just can't seem to get much right. you said: wrong again. i guess you haven't ever actually read the bible. the above is from britannica.	so do you think before you speak? abraham left mesopotamia, modern day iraq, for canaan to start a new religion. so where did he start the religion? canaan, modern day israel.  and yes i know that there is much more to the bible and my point was that you can't believe the bible 100 percent world for world or you would be contradicting yourself.	notsarc
science is different. in science it's a matter of who has the most convincing evidence. if we are to give christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates, can you honestly tell me that creationsim is the best answer? if so (and i extend the challenge i made to lappster) educate and enlighten us. i am eager (as always) to read the evidence for myself.	i have posted responses to demon38's earlier post. i have offered dna findings as evidence to begin with. it is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. that is the only evidence that i will provide in this discussion. i think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light.	notsarc

both thompson and mcdonagh treat the child—the woman's own daughter or son--like an invading stranger intent on doing harm. they make the mother/child union into a host/predator relationship. a child is not an invader, though, a parasite living off his mother. a mother's womb is the baby's natural environment. eileen mcdonagh wants us to believe that the child growing inside of a woman is trespassing. one trespasses when he's not in his rightful place, but a baby developing in the womb belongs there.	the argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. the relationship element will be dealt with in the third section.	notsarc
yes, it would be like teaching children...which doesn't seem to be that much of a problem. fair enough if they had to work it out for themsleves, in which case you would probably find that exactly the same thing we have now would have happened, but why not make it clear form the start. our forefather's weren't more stupid than us, they just hadn't discovered as much, but if they had god to dictate the history of what happened why both with all the parables. or have i got the wrong end of the stick and you think that we are discovering things closer to the truth and the stories are just a primative culture trying to work out how the world is as it is.	mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?	notsarc
don't play that card chester, it's a doozy. you post ad homs almost exclusively. you're like a 500 lb guy pointing to a guy who's just barely even chubby and saying 'you're fat!'	simply pointing out that swords cut in both directions.   be that as it may, no one has refuted that there are more cases of concealed carry permit holders who have gone off and assaulted people than there have been school shootings.   care to try? omegaman tried, failed, and went silent on the topic.	notsarc

"that's an interesting insight.(i'm going to have to borrow that story... :p i can't help but wonder for some people if the reason they ""mature"" on the issue of heterosexual sex has to do more with the fact that they start wanting to do it themselves.a desire to partake in the action, as opposed to actual mature development, causes them to shift their attitudes towards heterosexuality.to me, that's one of the reasons christianity (in general) has such a ""tolerance"" for divorce, which jesus spoke out against explicitly, while not as much tolerance for homosexuality.they want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it, so suddenly it's more ""tolerated""... emoticonxrolleyes"	"exactly, they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys. it makes them feel better about themselves. also, it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear, abortion will never be made illegal. that's how the religious right recruits folks - get 'em all indignant about the ""others"" and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor."	sarc
"i didn't see it that way at all. moore handled himself way better than i expected before i hit the play button. i thought for sure that he would be ""outfoxed"" to use a pun."	then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. he was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. it was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. he made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. bush doesn't send kids to iraq. first of all they volunteer. second of all, they are older than 18. please let me know what comments michael moore made that you thought were worthy. you might have trouble.  	sarc

however, ideas for laws come from a morality. in fact, our constitution did. to sit around and watch people die. that is something i'd rather not do and i am forced to.	that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?	notsarc
