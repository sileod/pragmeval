thanks to whites' attempt to assimilate africa, the ills you speak of have escalated ridiculously. tribal conflicts was the main drawback. aids, crime and poverty only started with the influence of whites trying to establish their culture in africa	"excuse me?! didn't aids started because your homies either ate or did the nasty with monkeys, thereby crossing the species boundary? what did it have to do with ""da man""? and crime and poverty in africa is also the white devil's doing? emoticonxconfused  "	sarc
you're a bit late there, aren't you? marriage has become a state institution as much as a religious one, and i see no practical way to undo that at this point.	well if there can be a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? where do they get that power constitutionally? so that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage constitutionally. i think that marriage is a church issue. let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. but leave marriage to the churches.	notsarc
lockheed martin rolls out poland f-16, nato's most advanced fighter. you know militarization of poland start to threaten me considering that this neighboring country (i live in east germany) began to receive first f-16s from the lot of 48 airjets that american corporation lockheed martin is producing fur poland. i hope i will give voice to the general opinion of european union if i say that poland failed to conciliate with old europe. what if poland will try to dictate terms to us demonstrating its newest weapon obtained from americans? it is clear that poland is a conducter of washington's will and ambitions in respect of the future of european union and they don't even try to conceal the fact that they see poland a wouldbe leader of europe which will certainly mean the end of eu as such. america will swallow us with the help of its weasel poland	you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons.	notsarc
when the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.	"it is so the womans decision. if the baby is in the womb they haven't experience life, so how can they miss it. and if they are a so called ""soul"" then they will come out somewhere else."	notsarc
why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? no one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. the question is would there be less murders without guns. in developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. at any rate, i don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.	a slimey claim you cannot support as usual. in developed nations, the u.s. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. those 'other' nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the u.s.	notsarc
you snipped most of my remarks because you were unable to address them. you have no answers and have been reduced to insult. that means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost. otherwise you would attempt meaningful answers.	actually, i snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what i said and 2) i'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and i was in a hurry to do something more important at the time.	notsarc
if there's one thing i can count on, it's your insistence on 100%, beyond any possibility of apologetic excuse creation, demand for absolute proof (with video-tape) if anything involves criticism of christianity or evangelicals or some association thereof...	and if there's one thing i can count on, it's your insistence that we can assume guilt and should make a public spectacle of the matter before even investigating any matter.   	sarc
that's your problem. any other subjects on which you are delusional?probably....i think anyone who kills an unborn child with a knife to the head is a murderer. does that make me delsional?	and for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. you care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. it seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. i am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do.	notsarc
if people with to smoke marijuana legally, then allow them to do so, but only after adding cyanide to it. if people want to smoke poison, then give them the real deal.	no more of a poison than alcohol (actually far less), should we start lacing that with strychnine?   ***i can see it now***  *excuse me bartender...what are the drink specials?  -we got bud light bottles for $4.00, jagerbombs for $7.50, and this new drink called convulsions on the beach. first one is on the house!	sarc
the study was based on data from the u.s. consumer products safety commission's national electronic injury surveillance system, which tracks sports and recreation-related injuries treated at a sample of 100 u.s. hospital emergency departments.figures showed that the number of injuries had jumped 150 percent in 2007 to 62,408 from an estimated 24,347 physical education-related injuries in 1997, with the increase seen for both boys and girls and across all age groups.	  i guess cheer leaders are the new tough guys and gals!	sarc
and what of people who oppose homosexual relations or legalized gay marriage, or both, but who aren't religious and therefore don't even use religion as an argument?	"i argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster. do we have any of those on this message board? because from what i can see, it's primarily the ""religious"" argument counter..."	notsarc
problem is that the right to marry is not a clear constitutional right. it is a right that has been interpreted by courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process.	"i see -- in your opinion is it is ""illegitimate"", therefore it must be so. i think i trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. it's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance."	sarc
that statement exposes your ludicrousy. first, you say you're against killing children who don't have a chance. then you say the death of the kurds and the wtc mean nothing to you. what chance did the children in the gassed kurdish village have? what chance did the children in the wtc day care center have?	the terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. personally, i disagree. when we kill children in iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. i disagree on that, too, i don't think it is necessary at all.	notsarc
for those who are in christ the tendancy is to be pulled towards good decisions.	like the crusades and the inquisition? how about the southern baptist convention, formed at the end of the civil war with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? and of course, the kkk and the aryan brotherhood make the same claims as you. of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. but when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so i just never turn my back on them. that way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, i will at least have my eye on my money.	sarc
still dumb to compare the two. both are no good. theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..chris rock actually did a funny skit on this.	so why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. i'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.	sarc
it seems in this case they used termination to get rid of dna evidence therefore allowing the stepfather to carry on abusing his step daughter.the mother should be charged with destroying police evidence and accessory to the crime.	just another bogus reason for having and abortion............there are thousands of them.........	sarc
cool, altough i would be just as fine if i just get my account selected for one of andy's 'roast a user' debates.	he'll get to you eventually, he's doing them in order of points. lol though i'm disappointed to say that a lot of people, including myself, are starting to lose interest in the roasts. i'm not surprised though, because there's a lot of inactive users.	notsarc
grow up...this is not about sex - far from it... geeesh...	gee, i'm just bowled over by your mature and articulate counterargument.emoticonxrolleyes we all know genitals have nothing to do with sex.	sarc
i wouldn't want to make my daughter do anything in this scenario. i'd be careful to explain all her options as free from bias as possible, and then let her choose.	me, too. i'd probably throw in some counseling as well, just for starters.	sarc
"well it all depends on who is going to determine ""right"", isn't it? abortion is not math. there are no finite answers. just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. no different now then when roe v wade became law or any other times in history. i do like aristotle's take; he taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable."	i do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define all abortions as either right or wrong. in between, there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong. why limit yourself to the extreme views? i do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. after all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. however, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights. really ... what other question is more relevant?	notsarc
yes easy, we are well aware that you are completely incapable of intelligently posting on topic. if you want to post a rant about ``dose evul librals``, do it on the proper forum, and i`ll ignore it there as well.	<flush>  just come up with something that discredits the resurrection, if you think you can. should be easy for you einsteins, shouldn't it?  but in two years i haven't seen it yet. not from you or anybody else.  where's the beef?	sarc
really bad logic. just because its broken doesnt mean im wrong.	you're somehow right despite the fact that all reliable evidence is on our side? what idiocy.	sarc
ah, well, then you in you 'broad and unprejudiced view'emoticonxrolleyesemoticonxrolleyes can obviously tell us those supposed myriad other views. i wait with bated breath for your answer.	the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.	notsarc
"you're just not getting it. either that or you're pretending to not get it. (i suspect it's the latter.) dude, the point is you're making a pointless distinction. it doesn't say anything that group a lies about one issue while group b doesn't, when group b lies about their pet issues just as much. you made an issue of them lying about ""family values"", as if lying about that one issue sets republicans apart as being worse that dems in terms of hypocrisy. it doesn't. get over it."	did you even read ythe op? did you even read the title?   pointless distinction? huh.   i understand what you are saying. i also know you are changing your argument. when it was proven that sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.   	sarc
3) there's no evidence for the big bangsadly, yes, i have actually seen this one fairly often. i have no idea where people get the idea that scientists make things up without having good evidence behind it (oh wait… we're out to disprove god because all scientists hate god or some xxxx like that).	now everyone will know marc was right all along--that there is an atheist science conspiracy.	notsarc
and it's so bleedin' unnecessary, too! why not just create the universe as it is? and just let the light take it's sweet time to get here? imagine what proof for creationism that would be: we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us. if god did create the universe only 6000 years ago, the fact that we can see the entire universe now can only count as a deliberate, i will repeat, a deliberate, oh how i love that word, deliberate deception on the part of the creator.	deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. i would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. the stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as god is concerned. he could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. i personally wouldn't fault him for this.	sarc
no, to rag on a gay activist--because of the hypocrisy. and there are certainly people here who also can't pass up the opportunity to show such hypocrisy with religious activists against gays, and i don't recall you opposing them on that. if you all are going to take glee in hypocrisy of religious activists against gay rights, you might as well realize that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.	so what are you claiming now? that all this time that rosie was making fun of the chinese, she's actually been chinese all the while? because that's the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who are hypocritically attacking gays while being gay themselves.	sarc
....first off, i know numerous gays with children of their own - to claim that they can't produce children is ludicrous.	really?!! i'm not aware of any kids being born to two gay biological parents (unless one is a lesbian and the other a gay man, that is).  	sarc
you'll pardon me, please, if i view your response as that of an idiot or dolt. nothing personal, mind you, just an observation. i'll try, in the future, to custom my responses to you. in any case, fare well. and remember that god loves you, even you.	what prompted this?  i guess i need to check what website i'm in...  your response, orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. one who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. but, i've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  but, carry on, orion. you've shown your true colors now. cluck at will... emoticonxchicken emoticonxrolleyes	sarc
what . . . you hope he'll have to take blood pressure medication? emoticonxdonnowhy don't you just come right out and say what you want to say, matthew.	well i am polishing my grave dancing shoes as these people in their 70's can not live forever.	sarc
i meant stop immigration and close all borders. have very little trade. i just want to see opinions. i am doing a policy debate for school and my teacher recommended getting other opinions on it.	not even let white people in? i can imagine why your teacher suggested a reality check.	sarc
so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? then why are you even against abortion? we are talking about a life here not just a fetus. i believe that everyone has a right to live. no fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. in the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt. if you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. what if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? what is your opinion on that?	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.	notsarc
sorry, i expanded my definitions here and was not polite enough to inform the rest of you :) i was not meaning to say just that nothing would be done about global warming (though i see now that it certainly appears that way). i am saying nothing will be done period. no preparation, nothing. we will wait until it is too late, act surprised when it happens, and then blame either the mexicans or the chinese. it is what we do.	as in we, do you mean we the usa or we, the world ? because this is a world wide issue and not something the us can solve on its own in any case.	notsarc
he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.	"no. what the doctor was doing was going to church. he was not a monster. he was not a ""sicko."" he was a murder victim.   what his murderer did was murder."	sarc
the record already acquired is amazingly good. it provides us with many detailed examples of a great variety of evolutionary phenomena on lower and intermediate levels and rather abundant data that can be used either by controlled extrapolation or on a statistical sampling basis for inferences as to phenomena on all levels up to the highest. among the examples are many in which, beyond the slightest doubt, a species or a genus has been gradually transformed into another. such gradual transformation is also fairly well exemplified for subfamilies and occasionally for families, as the groups are commonly ranked.... in spite of these examples, it remains true, as every paleontologist knows, that most new species, genera, and families appear in the record suddenly and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.george gaylord simpson, the major features of evolution (new york: columbia university press, 1961), pp 359-60.	notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question. my bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book, simpson would not be saying what toxey wants him to say.	notsarc
guilty of the rapes i'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?	no, but i read some of the evidence and it looked pretty solid. if this person was sentenced to life in prison without parole would you question the verdict?	sarc
um, recorded and document anglo/irish history? the same history that led john major and anthony blair to apologize to the irish people.	actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. and anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides.	sarc
the tired old 'you can't eat seafood' argument attempting to try to justify illicit gay sex sin.	"not nearly as tired as the ""you can't live like that because it is against my religion"" argument. hell, that one pre-dates christianity!"	sarc
i'm incredibly surprised you haven't got it now, especially as you put your stance as 'libertarian'. i am not a libertarian because i want to legalize drugs and prostitution or remove the age limit on alcohol and cigarettes. if the definition of libertarian has became that, the world is seriously screwed up. i am a libertarian because in my country, the taxes are above abnormal. 50-65% for an average salary, and up to 80% for a ''millionaire'' basically no one can be rich in my country. every time i get my salary, i am looking really forward to it. i work hard for my money, but it is tearing me down mentally, that half my money is taken away to pay for some alcoholic who is to drunk to get his money himself. it is killing the working spirit in me, and several others. that's why i am a libertarian.	libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised.	notsarc
part of me feels the syrians need to fight it out like every other country did, but the other half feels the war needs to be stopped. if there is an intervention, it needs to be done properly. by that i mean no nato countries. the intervention should be made up of arab un troops in blue helmets. this ensures there are no ulterior motives of the forces.	oh yeah..., my fiends did that for me. they had an intervention and they vented. they were pissed me for mercilessly trolling them and it worked. i am now a kinder, gentler, troll ;)	sarc
i don't think the point was to come up with an exact number of gun laws. the point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful. but the total number of gun laws may not tell us a whole lot. 100 cities could pass laws to require waiting periods. that would count as 100 gun laws. or the federal government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation. it would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city laws.	and your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. to contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.	notsarc
abortion is bad, there shouldn't be a need for it in the perfect world, but i'm not going to force my morality down your throat and force you to abide to my principals while demanding you abandon your own.	for once i agree with you. your wrong on your thoughts and views with evolution but your right in saying that abortion is wrong.	notsarc
no kidding sherlock. when did i compare any animal to fixed wing aircraft ? it was child who made the comparison.	insects are not birds. get your terminology correct. also please stop lying. it makes baby jesus cry.   	sarc
i just want to thank the forum participants for making my saturday quite nice. i am stuck by myself still recovering from gall bladder surgery and my wife is gone for a few days having to attend her fathers funeral. so today was made much more tolerable to me by this forum. the posts and debates were particualary interesting today and yesterday.thanks all.	wow....there is a real person under there. good luck on your recovery, chemist.	sarc
all they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids at home that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school. personally, i see no problem with this, as long as they stick to the facts in any case. just glanmcing over the proposed changes, i am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect.	but that is how creationism works - half truth. evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the patterns of cumulative change paragraph on page 7. that is pure yec. and you aren't a yec?	sarc
s.c. needs to stop the stupidity the post and courier - charleston sc newspaperbut then this is the state that elected jim demint, lindsey graham and joe wilson, not to mention notable incompetent and cheating on his wife mark sanford.	simone baby i'll see your sanford and raise you a mark spitzer, john edwards, jim mcgreevey and of course the king of sleeze der slickmeister willie.	sarc
i'm not going to argue with you if he does or doesn't. you'll have to take that up with some of the people in the gay rights movement. my point is that many people who have fought for human rights claim religion as part of their inspiration, and with your all-or-nothing approach, i can only assume you'd still condemn religion even if gets more and more gay friendly. so i find it odd you'd even bother to indicate any distinction.	i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!	notsarc
you would if it involved a gay sex proposal. then you'd hop on it in a new york minute. so don't add lying in addition to being an unrepentant, racist sodomite.	"and how is that? your stereotypical view is supposed to represent ""truth""?? lmao. b**** (and i mean that ""lovingly"") i'm friggin married. for 10 years. i don't accept ""gay sex proposals"", unless it's from my husband. and he ain't ""white"". i had my flings with y'all....and y'all ain't right. i moved on. and learn to use english ""correctly"". a remedial english course is recommended. and i have never lived in sodom. i'm a houstonian. b^^^^."	sarc
you disguting sickening woman! how can you tell a man that about his mum??!!! evil twisted filthy...........	hey i just aked a question ....... you think im evil , how would your mum have felt reading half the shit that comes out of your mouth. pfht fuck you darling. oh and i love you.	sarc
und the country using those talking points without any actual knowledge of what he's even talking about, and when confronted with the reality that he knows less than a rock about any given subject... well that's just stupid.	this is the most asinine argument yet. the man was making six figures as a radio talk show host. why would he leave that job to hit the road for 18 hour days away from family merely in the hopes of hawking a few extra books? he had an established platform to sell boks viz a viz his radio show, his frequent substitutions on other programs, and his status as a darling of the tea party. the man could line up paid speaking engagements to hawk his book. why would he trade that for unpaid speaking engagements to hawk his book?	notsarc
no, trebor. you preppies can cut and past all you want but your commentary did not impress me. try again.	fyi you'll get sand in your ears from sticking your head in too deep....	sarc
if there was no god explain how we are here there has to be some sort of god out there its kind of obvious...	agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along	notsarc
"what you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality? the definitions were accurate. it would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation. how about some evidence to support the ""theory.""by the way, i'm still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed. what you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under ""evolution,"" wasn't it?"	wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions 	notsarc
"...and before you go saying ""what about obamacare?"", you should know that it falls in the category of a."	only if you include the fact that while cleaning up the water he is beating the pipe with a hammer.	sarc
i don't think lindsay lohan is a good example of any group of people... when i was younger i worked in retail and thieves were everywhere... they just stole because they wanted stuff they couldn't afford. depends on what they were stealing while you worked in retail. and even if they did steal them, did they steal them to have them or to sell them for cash they could use on things they needed? you wouldn't know unless you followed their tracks after they stole. not to be a complete ass, but what you're saying sounds a lot like the corporate propaganda i've been hearing for years that encourages our culture to take a giant shit on the poor and law-breakers.	when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time... stuff their parents didn't want to buy them, peer pressure etc. i'm not trying to be an ass either i'm just surprised at your views on this...  maybe i'll make a debate and we can see what people on here think.	notsarc
if you're prepared to eat livestock feed you've got a plan.	"bad, bad, bad. :( 1) reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.1) some, perhaps all ""livestock feed"" is actually edible for humans; gm maize is regularly consumed in the us and mexico.2) one does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten."	notsarc
no only does the experiences one has make that person, but so does their effect on others. i didn't mean that only this and nothing else define a human being, i just used this on thing to justify abortion. this is an odd question, i mean, i can see myself saving someone's life if my stakes were relativly low, but to kill myself completely to save someone i don't know? i don't think so. would you, because i doubt it. of course they do.	for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?	notsarc
i have seen these debates and granted mine are not the best debates and may just be plain and simple retarded but my answers match the question. at least i think they do. but all you have to do is skip right over them.	darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class.	notsarc
the mumbai massacre was an attack by pakistani terrorists. if a country can't keep terrorists armed with machine guns and bombs from crossing its borders then you can't expect gun control to help in such situations. there might be even more such attacks in the us if the us shared a border with pakistan.	all the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?	sarc
it was a media circus, and had plenty to do with the establishment clause of the first amendment.	so the establishment clause was included to promote atheism, eh?	sarc
totally, now believe in my dragon lord king greeble the creator and master of the universe. he exists because i say he exists. now, let us pray to the one true creator of the universe king greeble the dragon lord.	there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)	sarc

i'm not saying you shouldn't argue against their weak moral position. i'm saying you shouldn't assume their emotions are what they would have to feel towards you to still oppose you if they shared your ethical system. of course they don't make one right. as for the kool-aid: i often see this referenced in arguments between americans, i have no idea what it is. i meant according to most christian theological viewpoints that oppose homosexual sex.	but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay.	notsarc

'imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.	except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. they have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. they have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. in short i have been barred from marrying the person i love because someone else, that i do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.	notsarc

i can appreciate this slant, however i think that a true feminist approach would be to support women who want their pregnancies by finding solutions to the reasons they feel an abortion would be their best choice.if we want to have a child, society should be backing us up on that. instead, i see such a stigma for single mothers, i see single mothers unable to finish school, i see single mothers unable to work a decent job b/c of either lack of education or lack of child care, i see systems where the men don't have to support, violence, et cetera.	that's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement. in fact, a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers. many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways, including financially.	notsarc

"""ready to go"", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.barbarian, regarding mutations:there is a lot of that. many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. the founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. the new ones evolved by mutation. sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. would you like to learn about it? ."	notsarc

because africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. there are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. their food sources are different, their territories are different. the more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. pretty straightforward, really.	but himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. and pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do. my point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction.	notsarc

i suspect that this will not be considered reasoned debate as it is disagreement with the anti dp stance. the rate of recidivism that produces dead innocent victims by paroled criminals far out weights the number of executed innocent men. fix the judicial system. make lawyers and law enforcement accountable for the errors that lead to deadly mistakes. quit making future victims pay for incompetence in law enforcement. dead murderers do not murder again. tugging at heart strings over the death of a murderer or the terror he feels on the way to the chamber gets no response. no joy, no sorrow.	but you are forgetting life-without-parole (and i do mean without parole). with life without parole, there is also no recidivism.	notsarc

great,if artificial wombs become avaliable then women can get zygote transplants rather then abortions,but the question for me is 'do zygotes have a right to life?'why does mere biology automatically = right to life? if this were the case than non-humans that are biological alive should also have the right to life.	no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.	notsarc

"1) it's hardly ""solved"".same-sex marriage is not legal in france. as of 2006, one same-sex marriage ceremony has been conducted in france and was declared void. france has a statute authorizing civil unions, known as pacs, between same-sex and unmarried opposite-sex couples.same-sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election, with the conservative ump opposing it and the socialist party supporting it, though both candidates support civil unions (pacs).....on june 5, 2004, former green party presidential candidate noël mamère, mayor of the bordeaux suburb of bègles, conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men, bertrand charpentier and stéphane chapin. mamère claimed that there was nothing in french law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the european court of human rights.french justice minister dominique perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.same-sex marriage in france - wikipedia, the free encyclopediawhat france has is ""well, both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door, but only the whites can enter by the main door""we wouldn't find such an ""acommodation"" satisfactory for blacks.and furthermore, i think you would find that it's the anti-gays who have the problem with this.if obama is able to try to put up ""civil unions"" on the federal level, you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him.not the gays..."

atheist answer: its relgious people that expect us to believe in god. god himself doesn't have any kind of expectations. theist answer: the bible says that without faith its impossible to please god, and since the bible also says that the bible is god's true word, then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in god.	"actually, everything the bible say's belies your ""atheist answer"". the reality is that the world itself and all of gods creation speaks to his existence as being self evident. it takes a degree of faith to accept jesus as our personal savior, but as far as accepting the reality of god himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving god could create such a beautiful and marvelous world with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life."	notsarc

alrighty, before everyone jumps on me with hurtful words. heh. i'd like to just give you my opinion on this matter. <3emoticonxangel first to bat, i'm not against the gay person, i'm not homophobic i'm against the homosexuality. i don't think gay people should be damned to hell, put in jail, or any of that stuff. that's absurd. what i do think, is that marriage is unity between a man and a woman. the *ok* for sex, and personally i believe it's origin is biblical. emoticonxlove jesus freak ^.vemoticonxzzzz	a gay person is a homosexual, friend. he can't change that part about himself. he was wired that way. if you don't like the idea of gay sex, then i'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. that's pretty simple. if you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one.	sarc

ases of aversion against gays, because homosexuality would be anathema toward procreation of the species. i realize this is all just theory. but i've never been comfortable attributing opposition to matters involving gay people just to religion-based morality. there are too many holes in that idea.	however, so much of the sex, in fact, most of the sex that happens, gay or straight, does not lead to reproduction. why is there not the same aversion to oral sex, masturbation, condoms, dating, etc.? no one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay.	notsarc

it should be legalised as it's no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco. not only that but many marijuana users end up going onto harder drugs through contact with their marijuana dealer. lesgalising it would break that link and actually reduce the level of drug addicts overall. furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.	ah i see. so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? sound a little too much like bribery to you too? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. why should i be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend i pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? sound a little counter-productive? and then we complain about a defecit?

simple: there was no copying. only a fool would expect a definitive answer. congradulations on finding a source. now, what is wrong with this: 'first, it cannot explain the differences among the writers' in that source? i can't tell that since you ripped my answer out of its context. you'd have to have proof that that is what occurred. and you can't. and why? it did for 1700 years till non-believers came along.	how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?	notsarc
"your analysis might be correct, although i don't think i'd bet big money on it. in particular, i'm not sure about your conclusion here:""the legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken.""my reading is simply that if they don't reach a conclustion in one session, they have to take it up again in the next one. if it's going to pass, it has to pass in two consecutive years, so simply taking it up in year three and saying, ""didn't pass in two consecutive years, failed"" may be legit."	i think this is a fair conclusion. i went as far as i did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. i may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. in other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. and it does not seem that the constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. i'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended amendment process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. any thoughts on this?	notsarc

lol. this entire argument is so inane.  it's entirely based on the assumption that the bible is true. obviously that is the fallacy of begging the question.  the bible as a whole is unverifiable, and for all we know was written back in the day by a guy who overdosed on opium.  the idea of rapture is completely irrevelant until the bible is verified as fact.	the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference	notsarc

evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamics—the entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase—poses no barrier to evolution. their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature, uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available. specifically the sun's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people. all that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy, especially the sun's energy. if complicated living organisms can be created in this way, certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced. especially a solar-powered house!	that's obviously not what is said. the sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. what it does do is override the tendancy within the 2lotd where total usable energy in a system decreases.	notsarc

"in 1927, supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes jr. declared it ""better for all the world"" if the ""manifestly unfit"" could be stopped from reproducing. ""three generations of imbeciles are enough,"" he famously wrote in his ruling in buck v. bell, which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800's . . . the british polymath sir francis galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it, which he named eugenics. in america, galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist charles davenport, who in 1904 established cold spring harbor laboratory on long island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. . . . davenport created a eugenics records office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named harry laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the ""germ-plasm"" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated. laughlin became an influential developer of american compulsory sterilization policy, which had officially begun in 1907 when indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .he helped congress formulate the 1924 immigration act, which kept out ""inferior"" people from southern and eastern europe. bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit: galton suffered from severe depression; davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic; and laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy. in america and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites. in britain, people as varied as winston churchill and george bernard shaw embraced its goals, and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals. eugenic science especially appealed to fabian socialists, who saw it as further justification for abolishing class — after all, once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied. in this country, eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of theodore roosevelt, the birth control crusader margaret sanger and leaders of the carnegie and rockefeller foundations. it galvanized temperance advocates, suffragists, and liberal american churches and synagogues. citizens enthusiastically entered ""fitter family"" and ""better baby"" contests."	from a book review of better for all the world: the secret history of forced sterilization and america's quest for racial purity by harry bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlhmmm, teddy roosevelt, winston churchill, the rockefeller foundations, millions of americans, the state of indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of eugenics.interesting, yes?	notsarc

i can see your point, though i am confused about gay sex drive, your saying a gay man's sex drive is not feminine? is it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain conditions? like being naked for example? there are gays that go to my gym, am i being homophobic if i purposely avoid showering with him? i can surely pick my friends; naturally my interests would hardly mirror a homosexuals interests. some are even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subjects as me. is it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friends can be?	well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.	notsarc

i agree. these laws limiting magazine capacity are based on stupid assumptions that are based on hollywood (think drive by hollywood). the average shooting involves less than 5 rounds fired. so limiting the capacity has no affect on crime.	well, i have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. so limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. so why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? when semi-automatic rifles were banned in australia, hunters welcomed the law. they saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. not so in america where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.	notsarc
originally posted by galileo why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? no one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. the question is would there be less murders without guns. in developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. at any rate, i don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.	your xxx-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. how many people have been killed in africa with short handled hoes and machetes? nary a gun amoungst them.	notsarc

that doesn't refute anything i've said. so criminals are more afraid of armed citizens. like i said that's why criminals would have more motivation to shoot an armed citizen. the greater the threat, the more reason to eliminate it.  it's not even close to 1950s levels.	so you want to try it as a demonstration? i thought not. claims are easy to make but you have produced no evidence but words and only fiction to present.  yep, it is almost there per 100,000. meanwhile, your nation is rising by leaps and bounds and innocent people are being convicted to protect criminals. even dan rather commented on u.k. crime being much worse than any place in america. there is a reason for that....	sarc
but what is apparent externally is not what is important. what is important is, if i teleported you, would you still experience the world through that new body.  if the answer is yes, the question is begged of just how identical does the new you have to be to the old one in order for you to experience the world in it. there is no reason to think that if we left a finger off of the new you, it wouldn't be you, because if i cut off your finger right now you would still be trebor. we get to the point where we could make you a completely different person, but still allow that this new body is yours. in addition, if two of you were created, you experience the world through two bodies, which also is not possible.	i don't want or not want to call this 'frame of refference' *thing* anything i'm just trying to work out what you consider it is. tell me what it is. tell me what it's capabilities are. if it is abstract in nature what is it's actual worth as a concept. whatever that is... this *something*? you aren't your body as i've shown but because your body generates your mind it, that which affects the body can effect the mind which i can only imagine is part of this 'frame of refference' *thing*. or, in reality, 'i', 'you' and 'me' is an illusion and doesn't actually exist.	sarc

you're missing the bigger picture. i don't see the conflict, biblically speaking. because in the kingdom of god there is also judgment. ever read about the israelis coming under judgment and being enslaved by the babylonians? why did that happen to them? because they did not love god and their neighbors as themselves. they broke the law of love. god didn't break it, they did. so, because they hated and did not turn from their wicked ways, they came under judgment. and if you read the book of judges, that usually humbles the people and turns their hearts back to god. that's why i say there is no conflict. god's economy makes sense.	ahhh i see so god was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor. like how sodom and gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor.  	sarc

any two adults can run the household, one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated, one inherits when the other dies, etc etc. that parallel does not carry over to group marriages. when one dies, who inherits? if one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious. if we're talking about legal recognition, and we are (right?), then the cases are wildly different. our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. they also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws; changing that is a huge project.	"yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate their form of marriage as well. the fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? it seems to me your argument boils down to ""polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it."" yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. laws can be worded to do it."	notsarc

how about the ability to marry multiple partners? or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage?	those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. we are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. there is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. in a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as m/f and can make a mockery or marriage just as many m/f unions currently do. the emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.	notsarc
you do have a good point. however, it does not change my mind. we do our best to make cars as safe as we can, but so many people need to travel fast just to work and survive. more importantly, when one gets into a car, they know that they run the risk of crashing.  i do my best to make my house as safe as i can. firearm possession is one of the means to attain that safety. when the criminal breaks into a home that criminal knows that he runs a risk of earning a chalk outline. remove the firearms and remove the risk to the criminal. consequently, ye increase the risk to the homeowner.	but is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? it's pretty easy to find information on the fbi and the cdc websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. people defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. that would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative.	notsarc

no, but some intelligence should be exercised when going to a court of law. for example, the choice of the board on who to represent them. do you think that the judge will be able to totally dismiss in his mind that this group mission is to push a religious agenda?	the judge should be informed that 'the leading' idist admits that id is religion.

you didn't answer my question.....toe says all structures evolved by small, random modifications. surely, then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete...that would be a contradiction now wouldn't it.....so answer my question: what about the feet? which foot came first? there are more to feet and other body parts besides bone...muscles, tendons, toenails....did all these evolve at the same time from the same mutation?...if not, in which order?	as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'.	notsarc
susan smith shocked the nation with the murder of her children. she believed her two young boys were an obstacle to remarriage, so she placed them in her car, fastened their seat belts, and drove them into the lake. smith's crime was especially obscene because she violated the most fundamental moral obligation of all: the responsibility a mother has for her own children. yet wouldn't susan smith be exonerated by thompson's and mcdonagh's logic? these children were kidnappers and interlopers, trespassing on smith's life, depriving her of liberty. why not kill them? those boys were attacking her. it was self-defense. last year, a couple in new york was arrested when authorities learned they took a 10-day vacation to florida and left their young children behind to fend for themselves. if mcdonagh's and thompson's arguments work, these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house. those children were invading their privacy, trespassing in their home, stealing their food.	all born children, and every woman had the right to be rid of them. killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb (during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur, at least). they are not comparable.	notsarc
i agree. time will tell if the cells are as effective as embryonic stem cells, and it seems on the surface, they well might be.except.these stem must be donated by pregnant women. amniocentesis, while pretty darn safe, is not without risk.first, the pregnant mother must donate the cells.the risk to the fetus is not zero.when we already have a zero risk procedure from cells that are going to be disposed of anyway.in any event, i am sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way.	yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but i think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. i think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. and yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonxrolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections.	notsarc
it is hard to believe that it won't draw attention away from everyone else. but everyone will get it and it will draw attention away from the families that are there supporting their kids...and the fact still remains that your goal is to influence (or show) the administration when it should be to give your child a good time.  when your purpose is to draw attention it is hard to imagine that it wouldn't take it away from the main purpose. think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents. my question is...if you are such great parents why aren't you with your kid instead of talking to the tv camera about your personal message? i don't buy it anymore than if someone got a big group together and had t-shirts that said 'i chose life for my child!'.	ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? i mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  ahhhh joe i it hit me of course this is like ghandis' salt march.	sarc

no it is not. darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what i'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly. i'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable, adaptive variation.	again, nonrandom is not the same as lamarckian. phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the toe, random mutation; the toe is much more than that.	notsarc

the minimum drinking age should be lowered to 14 if not 12. the main problem with alcohol is drinking habits, non-safe drinking habits are encouraged by a high age of license due to how alcohol is more likely to be consumed in bulk and away from proper supervision for those underage. laws prohibiting underage drinking fail to do such, and actually end up causing some of the situations they are meant to avoid. rather then alcohol being another part of life, used in moderation around family and good friends well supporting the economy by actualizing more of the demand for it. it is given the allure of the forbidden fruit, consumed as fully as possible whenever possible because its seen as a rare item to behold, and often consumed around shady suppliers or swigged from stolen bottles.	14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol.	notsarc

this is the root of the problem with the entire insurance based medical system. it is affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it, but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can. this is the heart of the debate. a lot of people find it morally unacceptable to let somebody with a treatable condition die in the richest country in the world for lack of care. at the same time in order for insurers to stay profitable, they need to not pay for treatment for people with expensive conditions.	and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know.	notsarc

chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point. why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - i can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?there's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before i've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). if you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then i struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because i said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.

archangel is right on this one. it's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person...	archie is not right - he has an opinion, as we all do. pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. the blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. so the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it is. it isn't. it's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. you can't deny that.contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body.	notsarc

belief that memory and free will exist but do not take up space does not require belief in a personal god.	well memory is not something that is immaterial is it. its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. by no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. the autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. again a purely materialist explanation. and there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. in other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.	notsarc

if abortion is made illegal i predict that you will see across the border abortion clinics, in canada and states that still premit abortion. are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions? prolifers better becare for what they wish for. prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes. they better get ready to pay, in taxes, for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children.	your claim is not supported in the least. if we look to the landmark abortion case roe v. wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. it would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. to prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the partial birth abortion ban act. needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.	notsarc

oh good grief!i have always lived in rough areas. in one city, alburquerque, a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where i slept, and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun.where i worked, less than a block away, a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place.i was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an er, i didn't know the stupid beast, i was scared to death, but i felt it my christian duty (even though i am not a christian) to get the guy to where he could get treatment.and i don't own a damned gun because i am not chicken-hearted.	i sincerely doubt any of that happened. if so you would have links. yea we know you are cyber brave to the point of heroine status. you are a troll pure and simple.	sarc
by your logic, when the supreme court ruled that african americans were not citizens and that they were not entitled to protection by the constitution in dred scott v. sandford (1857) people should have just shut up and moved on.	except in the dred scott case the court wasn't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right, or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery.	notsarc
mirrored post,... it might be easiest to preserve flow later on if we don't actually mirror each of our posts once comments arrive (and inevitably digress) - just let people quote/cite us from this one if needs be. i certainly plan on adding in more off-topic commentary/digressions in the mirror thread (marked in these posts as *, when i remember to).	iangb, i would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that i have supported my claims. i also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.' at this point, i actually have you questioning planned parenthood's definitions? quote; 	notsarc

some people would say that launching long range missiles and killing innocenet civilians was a diversion to take the heat off of monica and he in the oval office......	and suddenly vor's list of incorrect statements has finished another lap around the universe! the area which was litterally saturated with cruise missiles was sparsely populated. the brass complained about 'hitting empty tents with multi-million dollar cruise missiles.'  suddenly you are concerned with killing innocent civilians? seriously, you have no problem when bush's policies gets a few thousand killed, but the instant clinton's massive cruise missile launch aganist terrorists kills one innocent, you're all over him. talk about massive hypocracy. you bitch about clinton not doing anything, then you bitch when his attacks on terrorism cause collateral.  seriously, get some therapy and some education.	sarc
2) along the same lines, how did the appendages created by mutations actually become something usefull? for example an animal might have developed a wing like appendage, but it wouldn´t have the correct muscles that it would need to actually move the wings.	i suspect that you are thinking of birds. but early birds had fingered claws on those wings. it is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. the wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. there is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. and of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. very small insects require almost no wings to fly. what they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. if by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.	notsarc

this really would be a good question.  since those of specific faiths tout that to engage in sexual intercourse out of wedlock is bad, but still don't agree to allowing gay marriages, which would they prefer?	i don't follow.

'the philosophy of experimental science…began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces he had set in operation… it is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.'	origins of science, whether truly started by those of faith or not, is irrelevant. whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason.	notsarc

while adolf did in fact gain followers that were 'christian', to say that he gained 'christian followers', is in the very least a misrepresentation. this is a lie and can only be substantiated by an athiest website, ie; 'nobelief.com' your insistance that christianity is the great 'evil' in the world, is relevant to the lie you stated above. interesting accusation foundit, you attempt to disparage archangel for his christianity, while you just count the scriptures irrelevant along with every other religious institution, and make up your own morality. frank caliente doing his john madden imitation 'here's a guy who knows so much about so little he can judge the ethics of somebody who actually has ethics, while having no ethics of his own! will brett favre come back, i don't know lets ask foundit66, he seems to know everything about nothing'	which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie.	sarc
imo, that's beside the point. the problem with judicial fiat is that it's a way to get things done despite the will of the people. sure, people may still oppose gay marriage even if it's done legislatively as opposed to judicially, but at least then they'd have the chance and opportunity to do so. with only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important. so i think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat. of course you feel they shouldn't have a say, so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat.	but the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. the courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.	notsarc
if the only choices we can possibly make are the one god approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that god does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that god approves of. this is not free will	your right, this is not complete free will. but as i mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying god has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not god anymore.	notsarc
perhaps. but which would you rather have: promiscuity without protection or with? the distinction can matter, so if there is going to be promiscuity going on, i for one would perfer to see it be safe-sex, as much as possible. but even better would be if a person not being promiscuous at all, imo anyway.	if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex.	notsarc
but one idea that makes me hesistate to be pro-choice is an analogy. imagine a hunter who sees something moving behind a bush. it could be a deer, it could be a human, or it could be something else. the hunter lacks the information to know for sure what is behind the bush. what is the ethical policy for a hunter in this situation? it seems clear to me: if you are not sure it's not human, don't kill it.	so if it's not human, we can kill it? but i dare say that's a different topic completely. sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. abortion is this for me: if the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. it sounds a bit cruel and i didn't intend it to be that way at all. it's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?	sarc

how does gay legalised gay marriage=legalized polygamy? how does equal protection come into play on that equation?	because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. but that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. and we have to stop that.	notsarc
how so? do you mean to treat others, better than you would have others treat you? then you are merely a perpetual victim to sociopaths. people are not always following the golden rule, and that's where the social unrest and problems start. without some degree of this a society cannot function and there would be no social cohesion and there would be constant conflict without peace.  why does it serve them to do so? it's because we are social. it's mutual self-interest, sure, but the larger human need to interact with the other is always there. no one is an island. no one is completely selfless either. we preserve ourselves, so we may realize our full potential by some degree of social interaction and co-operation.	so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war.	notsarc

do you think that english is in some way uniquely suited to the pursuit of science? there is a pretty long history of science in india. i'm not an expert on pre-colonial india but i'm pretty certain it was not the primitive land you seem to think it was. western science could have been obtained by other sources than colonisation. japan is an alternative example of how trade with the west might have occured.	you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them.	notsarc

i have been in several 3rd world countries, and i have never once seen a case where someone would be killed if they didn't convert to christianity, or even if they did convert from christianity to islam. on the other hand, i have seen a number of cases where muslim family members who converted to christianity had to flee their family out of fear of death. i would be very interested in reading about or hearing about cases where the reverse is true, but i don't think there are many such cases out there. the issue of witchcraft among christian churches may be an exception at least to the degree of people and children being ostracized.
