if international passengers are allowed to disembark, but are unable to access bathrooms or shops to obtain food or reading material, i don't see that as a reasonable accommodation.	unverifiable
if there is no cost difference for me to fly on an airline the airline i have contracted with has sub-contracted with to fly me somewhere, i am ok knowing only the all-in price.	unverifiable
and unilateral changes to fees that affect the traveler should not be allowed.	unverifiable
as to fees and taxes, i believe refunds should include any fees and taxes the carrier has not otherwise been required to pay to someone else.	unverifiable
when the airport is more than two hours away, notifying passengers of a potential half hour delay won't significantly change whether they head for the airport or not.	unverifiable
however, in retrospect, i would have loved to know the following when booking flights: 1 airline's yearly on time percentage; 2 airline's passenger satisfaction rating.	unverifiable

an credit card credit, if immediate, would be more secure and as useful to more passengers than either a check or cash.	unverifiable

i would ask this individual to consider this proposition more fully,	unverifiable
as i suspect that 6 hours of screaming from said toddler while the distraught parent struggles valiantly to keep the surgical mask in place will result in far greater discomfort than the loss of the 2 ounce bag of airplane peanuts.	unverifiable
a full ban on peanut products is unenforceable and not practical.	unverifiable
overall, i can foresee that this may be a bit inconvenient and people affected may find this to be an annoyance,	unverifiable

the thought that an organization deemed qualified to routinely operate and maintain something as complex as a modern airliner might respond that they 'can't' avoid imprisoning people on an airplane is absurd.	unverifiable

but i did not have a reaction	experiential
the mere fact that i had an open bag of nuts in my carry-on - even if i never took it out - could have been enough to trigger this girl's allergy.	unverifiable
because i am responsible for controlling my own allergies, whether that means carrying a dust mask or an epi-pen aboard.	unverifiable
truly life threatening food allergies are vanishingly rare.	non-experiential

"as for the ""slippery slope"" argument - i don't buy it."	unverifiable

"*  i would feel  safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted."	unverifiable
again, it's about personal responsibility.	unverifiable
frequent flier miles and certificates offered as compensation are valued at the discretion of the airlines.	non-experiential
the cut-off should be for all types of planes, not just large ones.	unverifiable
but, peanuts and tree nuts combine for the top cause of er visits for treatment of life threatening symptoms each year.	non-experiential
a time period must be specified--	unverifiable
but, like i said, it probably would not be enough for me and mine.	unverifiable
however, i also understand the concerns of people with severe peanut allergies.	unverifiable
agree with mezo.	unverifiable
people with severe allergies are flying with other airlines.	non-experiential
but she broke out in hives across her entire body.	experiential
people are people no matter where they are and should not be subjected to being miserable after paying a fee to fly somewhere!	unverifiable
and there should not be a limit on how long changes are posted--many people are not frequent flyers and whether you fly once a year or every week you should know exactly what you will pay.	unverifiable
if they start charging for carry-ons as i have described then i will quit flying.	unverifiable
and every effort to get you on your way should be made--whether it is 30 minute updates for a delay--or getting you on another flight if is a cancellation.	unverifiable
if you need to rebook due to no fault of your own--the flight is canceled, etc. there should be no or very minimal fees to rebook you for another flight.	unverifiable
delays and cancellations cannot always be helped and are part of everyday business for airlines	unverifiable
in any other industry i don't have to put up with the retailer replacing my apple with an orange and then telling me, if you *really* want the apple, you have to pay us more for it.	unverifiable
but it should be an option that people can select not a requirement for everyone else to abide by.	unverifiable
this site will give you some insight into the peanut allergy issue.	unverifiable
information on the fees should appear everywhere information on ticket prices appear.	unverifiable
the results would be better service to customers and a renormalization of the playing field from which the airlines compete without fear of being undercut.	unverifiable
i applaud the governments efforts to reign in the out of control airlines in this country.	unverifiable
the nature of the industry defies an easy fix.	unverifiable
i wish i had a creative solution to the problem.	unverifiable
at the very least, dot should make clear to airlines that they *can* discriminate on the basis of weight without fearing regulatory action.	unverifiable
for flights stuck on the tarmac, they must return to an open gates.	non-experiential
open gates are sometimes difficult to find--at least in my experience.	unverifiable
the biggest issue is not having updated information about flight status.	unverifiable
any disability needs to be treated with sensitivity.	unverifiable
and every time a new regulation comes along it always carries unintended consequences.	unverifiable
not getting timely notice when there are delays to flightsor, even worse, when a flight has been canceled;	unverifiable
i have been lethally allergic to peanuts all my life,	experiential
i think we should consider actual needs  on flights, instead of what people prefer.	unverifiable
as the father of a three year old daughter who was recently diagnosed with a life-threatening peanut allergy, i fully support a ban on peanuts and food containing peanuts.	unverifiable
moreover, with the number of children diagnosed with peanut allergies having tripled between 1997 and 2007  this threat is neither extremely limited nor decreasing.	non-experiential
i commend the dot for being on top of this issue and urge the adoption of a final rule banning peanuts and peanut products from airplans.	unverifiable
i think that the fees for optional services should be clearly disclosed at the time of ticket purchace and also be clearly printed in bold, 12 point font on the ticket and ticket confirmation itself.	unverifiable
according to the cdc the number of asthma related deaths was 3,616 in 2006.	non-experiential
and patients usually need to be watched in a hospital for 4-6 hours following a reaction.	unverifiable
solution-no bagged peanuts on flight.	unverifiable
probably not	unverifiable
in addition, even if the entire flight fare is refunded , there are other costs that the bumped passenger could face such as non-refundable or prepaid hotel reservations or other travel and travel related expenses.	non-experiential
i am happy to volunteer if there is some sort of compensation and i am not in a huge rush or too inconvenienced.	unverifiable
this should include differentiating between which charges originate from an airline and which don't, and should also include a clear explanation of the differences between what rights you have at different fare levels.	unverifiable
an outright ban of peanut-containing products on board airplanes, whether they're provided by the airline or brought on board by passengers, might be in order.	unverifiable
at the very least, i think the dot needs much more legally based response to this question then is currently included in the notice of proposed rulemaking.	unverifiable
it would seem to me that congress would not have any reason to cut off funding over peanuts, if dot hasnt tried this stunt since 1999.	unverifiable
anyone traveling by air is usually going somewhere where they need to bring luggage.	unverifiable
"also, i feel the more luggage ""carried on"" increases the security risk."	unverifiable
and if it was proven that perfume, body odor or bad breath  was shown to cause death, then yes, those should be banned as well.	unverifiable
it was delivered to where i was staying 70 miles from the airport.	experiential
we better ban pretzels too...	unverifiable
this isn't a dot issue,	unverifiable
since airlines have to be competitive and make a profit for their investors, things will not be perfect.	unverifiable
"i, for one, am happy to see the end of this ""wild west"" of the american airline industry."	unverifiable
i hope this is also considered by the dot	unverifiable
no one expects perfection.	unverifiable
surcharges should not be allowed in any case.	unverifiable
but i can empathize with those with worse conditions.	unverifiable
although i am not against the idea of peanuts being restricted from all flights,	unverifiable
forcing them to come up with an accurate estimate is what is needed.	unverifiable
if you charge for a service , and do not provide that service... then a refund is in order.	unverifiable
on a flight to hawaii, my bag was delayed about 4 hours, and delivered to my hotel.	experiential
what is so special about an international airline.	unverifiable
i don't think airlines will either.	unverifiable
the remainder is run through filters to remove pollutants and particulants and mixed with fresh air again.	non-experiential
but that's not the same thing as an allergy,	non-experiential
and the ada does not extend any protection to you,	non-experiential
since allergies are not a disability.	non-experiential
this is no different.	unverifiable
i think most tarmac delays are either weather related or traffic related.	non-experiential
there would of course be costs involved,	unverifiable
my son's dairy allergy is severe,	experiential
he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.	experiential
if he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.	experiential
so we must protect ourselves.	unverifiable
the vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.	unverifiable
i am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.	experiential
of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.	unverifiable
i am 4 years old.	experiential
frankly, i am horrified at the negative attitudes and comments from people who feel their rights are being taken away should peanuts  be banned from flights.	unverifiable
we have all been on flights where it is obvious that the cleaning crew did not have time to do a thorough job on the areas that can be seen.	unverifiable
delta does not believe in peanut free flights.	unverifiable
as we have been dealing with my son's food allergies for many years.	experiential
so we left immediately.	experiential
if my child were to step on to an airplane  with no precautions taken i have no doubt he'd react.	unverifiable
because we've never let his reactions progress	experiential
i personally think everyone should carry epi pens	unverifiable
between the u.s. and canada, approximately 3.3 million people suffer from peanut and or or tree nut allergies,	non-experiential
just an additional  comment, flying either domestic or international has become the most frustrating part of a travel package.	unverifiable
perhaps they can protect any loses by unbundling the amount of oxygen a passenger consumes inflight.	unverifiable
maybe the ban could extend to all foods when there is a specific request.	unverifiable
allergies  need to be diagnosed using gold-standard testing and rigorous science.	unverifiable
and there has been no increase in peanut allergies, despite what ananagoge and groups such as faan would like everyone to believe.	non-experiential
if you choose to live your life in fear over imagined risks, you've already given up your right to travel anywhere, by any means.	unverifiable
if we are to believe the claims of	unverifiable
disabled people aren't looking for pity,	unverifiable
antanagoge says he believes each individual must take responsibility for managing their condition,	unverifiable
but then he tries to shift that responsibility on to other passengers by claiming that banning peanuts is a reasonable accommodation.	unverifiable
no, it's not.	unverifiable
people who want peanuts can bring their own, easily enough.	unverifiable
i find the proposed rules solutions!	unverifiable
why should mobility restricted people be allowed on planes,	unverifiable
as a trauma nurse i have been called upon over 10 times to provide critical medical services in flight	experiential
and it was refreshing to see another world traveler with the same thoughts.	unverifiable
i don't have an airborne allergy	experiential
but i don't like the smell of peanuts being eaten around and in close proximity to me, especially when the air is being recirculated as it is in an airplane.	unverifiable
first - if the allergy is severe enough to be airborne - the air in the airplane is circulated through the whole plane, not just the three rows in front and behind you.	non-experiential
i have a 9-year old with a peanut allergy	experiential
if you have the allergy you do need to be prepared with medications and clean your area with wipes or cover your seat.	unverifiable
since the aircraft is already contaminated with peanuts, peanut oils, and peanut dust in the fabric of the seats;	non-experiential
but one particular person ignored that idea,	unverifiable
i very quickly found a link to the asthma and allergy foundation of america that contends that under both the ada and section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1974 that allergies and asthma are both recognized disabilities.	non-experiential
if you've ever seen images of fabric through a microscope you'll understand why it takes such force to dislodge captured particulates.	unverifiable
perhaps we've just been lucky so far.	unverifiable
there is no alternate transportation for international flights.	non-experiential
and it is dangerous to use a second epi-pen soon after the first one.	non-experiential
it is not a cure, but a stopgap measure to save life.	non-experiential
i do feel for the small minority of people with allergies	unverifiable
this is a small special interest group.	unverifiable
all passengers must be told and screened for peanuts and peanut-containing products.	unverifiable
i'm sure at least one passenger has one on most every flight.	non-experiential
don't nickle and dime me.	unverifiable
my child has a fairly severe peanut allergy.	experiential
and so even with the proper medication available death is still a possible outcome.	non-experiential
the comparison to a person in a wheelchair is not apt.	unverifiable
"i suggest that more ""essential"" right should trump the lesser."	unverifiable
the other side of any right is the obligations it imposes on others.	unverifiable
there are a lot of those out there.	unverifiable
i can assure you that this is a very important issue;	unverifiable
it is important that the general public be made aware of the lifestyle restrictions that this situation puts on those who suffer from the allergy.	unverifiable
people with  a severe allergy can die from a reaction to the peanut protein in the closed confines of a plane with recirculated air.	non-experiential
an epi-pen is only a stop gap solution.	non-experiential
you cling to irrational fears to support your desire, rather than reason and evidence.	unverifiable
you'd rather live your life in constant fear of things that are so unlikely, thus creating unhealthy anxiety for you and your child.	unverifiable
southwest airlines has done this for us in the past	experiential
they are not mostly imagined	unverifiable
great comment.	unverifiable
i am a parent of a multi-food allergy 6 year old.	experiential
living in a world surrounded by lack of awareness tends to deprive them of enjoyable things in life far more then avoiding the offending food.	unverifiable
the problem is, it is a stress induced reaction , not an allergy.	non-experiential
with all the hysteria being spouted by you and others, it seems like this board should be full of heartbreaking tales of dead loved ones.	unverifiable
anyone with a severe allergy already has epipens or other medications.	non-experiential
i have also attended lectures from immunologists in an effort to determine precisely what is a threat to my daughter and how large of a threat a particular item may be.	experiential
which the airlines aren't going to do.	unverifiable
the fact that you don't understand that illustrates your ignorance of the issue at hand.	unverifiable
there's no disability here at all.	unverifiable
everyone is allergic to something,	non-experiential
so using your reasoning, we'd be on a plane with no food, along with some other things,	unverifiable
which would make it a very unpleasant flight for everyone involved.	unverifiable
i can't believe there is any debate on this at all,	unverifiable
mount sinai medical school and the jaffe food allergy institute is one of, if not the, premier institute in the country working to solve the food allergy mystery.	non-experiential
one should be compensated accordingly.	unverifiable
this should be able to be handled with a minimum of fuss.	unverifiable
a 3-month period for displaying information about changes on websites is about right,	unverifiable
make the air ticket bundled like what public transportation are doing right now like metro, bus, cruise, train, that they don't charge for baggage fee.	non-experiential
those who dislike those policies can choose to fly elsewhere.	unverifiable
because this information is available to you, you are free to make your decision on this basis.	unverifiable
because an airport cabin is a confined space	non-experiential
which can be deadly to an asthmatic occupying that seat on a subsequent flight.	non-experiential
in addition to disclosure, there needs to be a requirement that whatever fees were in effect the day the ticket was purchased, are the fees the passenger actually pays.	unverifiable
keep in mind that you wouldn't be able to get out of the plane if it were in the air, either.	unverifiable
airlines know ahead of time that flights are oversold,	non-experiential
unfortunately, there's no way to give advance notice.	unverifiable
"i am concerned about the length of time customers are put ""on hold"" or spend trying to navigate automated call centers."	unverifiable
they should not be able to ask for additional money if the price goes up unless the opposite is true...	unverifiable
honest price information will definitely help the consumer make an informed decision about which airline to fly.	unverifiable
i did not see mention of compensation for non-weather related delays or cancellations.	unverifiable
there was no consistency.	experiential
i often travel in a party of 4	unverifiable
while the ac is on hold, the seat belt sign is off, toilets are available, and cabin service serves a full hot meal .	non-experiential
now that we know the average passenger, the total capacity, and the total cost it is a simple math problem to determine price per passenger.	non-experiential
so, after i return i wrote the ceo.	experiential
and the rank and file learn that they can be replaced.	unverifiable
for the obvious reasons this time frame should be halved.	unverifiable
and de-plane.	unverifiable
keep the air flowing.	unverifiable
though this might involve having security staff on hand to enforce.	unverifiable
and 4 of the 7 kiosks were not working.	experiential
this leads to an inefficient bunching of many flights on somewhat smaller planes at peak times, leading to congestion and delays.	unverifiable
the 3 hour rule should be universal, i.e., international and domestic. no exceptions.	unverifiable
the passengers has to right to know the delay.	unverifiable
my problem is that the passengers are not kept informed.	unverifiable
when a prolonged delay happen, since the seat belt sign is on the lavatories are closed by  the staff	unverifiable
your new requirements are excellent and warranted.	unverifiable
holding passengers in cramped seats with poor air circulation and minimal services, little information and consideration for their comfort is both physically and mentally unhealthy.	unverifiable
the pricing system now in place seems like an old west, frontier-days free-for-all: get as much as you can any way that you can.	unverifiable
it's become a torture to fly long distances, something to be endured rather than enjoyed, at least for those of us in coach.	unverifiable
airlines should not be allowed to oversell flights.	unverifiable
this is impossible to regulate.	unverifiable
going after volume is a risk to people and the industry.	unverifiable
this is particularly an issue for people flying in groups;	unverifiable
on smaller flights it is reasonable to prohibit overbooking.	unverifiable
it should not be hard for a ticket agent to disclose all the risks and information about a potential bumping.	unverifiable
when this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport.	unverifiable
but this way, if they are banned, you prevent some allergic person from potentially dying because someone is a selfish jerk.	unverifiable
a committee made of the incumbent airlines, the airport and the faa should be empowered  to discuss the situation and to make decisions.	unverifiable
airlines should give full disclosure on the amount they will pay rather than offering different prices to different people.	unverifiable
but the dot isn't doing much to assist them in overcoming it!	unverifiable
and i say to ban all food items from being on planes .	unverifiable
although i do not object to system in effect years ago.	unverifiable
and passengers should be so advised.	unverifiable
services that were not included previously shouldn't have to be posted.	unverifiable
baggage fees have created an issue with carry on bags.	unverifiable
flights are fuller, and now there are more carry-on bags too.	non-experiential
otherwise the rule is a complete waste of time for everyone.	unverifiable
but the rest point to ineptitude and a lack of service oriented culture.	unverifiable
we can all get by on a pretzel if needed to protect other passengers.	unverifiable
without having to pay compensation  the carriers have no incentative to ado their best.	unverifiable
an airplane flight is no different than any other event, let's say like a concert.	unverifiable
once the concert promoter sells all his seat inventory, he's done.	unverifiable
let the airline sell all his inventory of seats and be done.	unverifiable
as a frequent flier, i appreciate the intent of this rule to provide good information to passengers.	unverifiable
if you're waiting for crew, you're stuck if not at a hub,	unverifiable
but someone else can often be found at a hub so a delayed time may be moved earlier again.	unverifiable
i was concerned when the pilot announced we would return to the gate if anyone wanted to deplane - losing our place in line, disrupting connections even more, etc.	unverifiable
all proposals are reasonable and should apply to all carriers and all agencies  who are involved for fees, delay history, etc	unverifiable
i am severely allergic to dogs and have had asthma attacks when assistance animals or pets are seated near me.	unverifiable
proposed compensation caps should be equal to no more or less than the normal cost of the ticket plus $100.	unverifiable
the seat value should be placed at the normal fare or with the same number of frequent flyer miles as was used to book the ticket.	unverifiable
people have all kinds of allergic reactions in all kinds of places	non-experiential
there should be one rule  for all flights -	unverifiable
i am tall with back problems,	experiential
three hours is way too long!	unverifiable
the size of the airport does not matter,	unverifiable
passengers should be allowed off anytime with out anyone having to tell us we can, period.	unverifiable
go back to the gate	unverifiable
i fly international a lot,	experiential
"my worst experiences with notifications have been ""after hours"" at some airports,"	unverifiable
sadly the current carry on rules are not enforced!	non-experiential
this would simplify security, and help alleviate the problems with the carry on luggage.	unverifiable
in addition, the airline should compensate the bumped individual for the time they wasted because the airline bumped them.	unverifiable

right now - the only thing is captioned is safety.	non-experiential
i think we need something like that for airfares.	unverifiable
for sure oversales or bumping compensation needs to be adjusted for inflation and zero-fare passengers compensated in miles plus cash for extra money paid.	unverifiable
southwest has been a shining example of what the legacy airlines should look forward to if they don't treat customers right.	unverifiable
and let someone else without the legacy problems to have a go at it.	unverifiable
baggage fees are an exception, though.	unverifiable
however, i agree with another poster.	unverifiable
especialy with recycled cabin air.	unverifiable
our pediatrician called us at all of our nighttime emergency numbers just to ensure we wouldn't step onto any holiday airline flights without an epi-pen and proper documentation of his condition.	experiential
in all honesty, i can't see making the switch to peanut free snacks to be that big an impact to the airlines.	unverifiable
the allergic community is so grateful that you are allowing our voices to be heard.	unverifiable
we fly out of a small airport on small feeder planes marked as related to usair, delta, and soon american.	unverifiable
i agree with clt_pass,	unverifiable
late bags ought to have any baggage fees refunded.	unverifiable
the idea that at least one bag checked be included in all fares would improve safety in the cabin, given our current situation with large, heavy bags jammed into overhead bins or under seats to avoid fees.	unverifiable
"it would appear that airlines are now making more money from the ""taxes and other fees"" than from the ""fare"" portion of what we pay them."	unverifiable
ticket prices should include all fees seamlessly--no having to opt in or out or read fine print.	unverifiable
it should never be ok to increase the price after a confirmed purchase--this is ludicrous!	unverifiable
3 hours is a reasonable time limit for all carriers	unverifiable
more time than that on the tarmac is nothing more than a demonstration by the carrier that they have not planned properly and are willing to make the paying customer pay for their poor planning.	unverifiable
the customers pay these fees.	non-experiential
if you kick me off my flight, i should get a refund for that flight  and be put on the next one at no cost.	unverifiable
and you can only give two doses without medical supervision,	non-experiential
"i fail to see why eating peanuts in particular is seen sa a ""right"""	unverifiable
of course the flyer and the flyers rights organization will then crucify the airlines for such poor planning.	unverifiable
flyers need to grow up and quit pouting and blaming everthing on the airlines.	unverifiable
i believe the current diagnosis rate of peanut allergy is almost 1 in 100 children.	non-experiential
the airline i was traveling on  did not provide adequate updates in my opinion, and only provided passengers with seltzer water roughly 90 minutes into the delay, and did not keep the aircraft cool using the air conditioning .	unverifiable
those with medical conditions may need to carry-on multiple medications and or or devices , that take up room.	non-experiential
i'd rather bring my own affordable healthy snacks and meals.	unverifiable
one free checked bag also prevents discrimination against those that can't physically cope with carrying luggage around an airport  and putting it in or removing it from the overhead bin.	unverifiable
that could still be  if the airlines can't determine what is obviously reasonable, let the courts decide.	unverifiable
it would be better to have fewer promises the airline has to keep than having misleading or never communicated standards.	unverifiable
and no one should have a problem with this issue.	unverifiable
i know a day will come when we need to get somewhere in a limited amount of time.	unverifiable
there is nothing he can do to make it go away.	non-experiential
seems to me that the captain should already be filling that role,	unverifiable
if they only planned for a 30 minute flight, bringing a full meal 'just in case' would be unreasonable to expect.	unverifiable
almost universally enjoyed,	unverifiable
in that very small subset that are effected, actual life threatening reactions are incredibly rare.	non-experiential
if we were to adopt that level of thinking, then everyone would qualify as disabled,	unverifiable
and if they were all caused by peanut or tree nut allergies, that's still a very small number.	unverifiable
even if peanuts could be banned from airliners, that would not remove the risk,	unverifiable
so, if you are so risk averse that you want to ban peanuts due to the extremely remote possibility that someone could actually be injured by one, then you really shouldn't be flying, as planes do occasionally crash.	unverifiable
but i don't consider it my right to have airlines serve them to me.	unverifiable
i think some of this is just outrage that someone dare put a regulation on something.	unverifiable
as a fellow air traveler, i agree with some of the points you are making...	unverifiable
air is not recirculated on airplanes.	non-experiential
for this reason, i can never use any form of public transportation.	unverifiable
the proper way to do this is to ban a substance from the conveyance only if a passenger on that conveyance has a life-threatening allergy to it.	unverifiable
there in lies the problem.	unverifiable
take responsibility for yourself and your children.	unverifiable
if you want to regulate this then insist that all policies related to overbooking, rebooking, rerouting, basically any changes to the originally contracted flight must be made available in a format that is easily accessible and understandable to the general public.	unverifiable
i have had flight times changed and the airline failed to email or telephone me.	experiential
but not everyone prints them in advance.	unverifiable
i appreciate that this is being considered and taken so seriously by the dot!	unverifiable
"one would hope that you are a reasonable enough individual that if someone came to you and said that ""eating peanuts next to me could make me really sick - please don't do that"" that you would not choose to 'resist' this person."	unverifiable
this is a matter of life and death to some people,	non-experiential
please also see posts above citing the peer reviewed medical literature regarding the prevalence of food allergies, and specifically peanut allergies, in children.	unverifiable
we recently flew with our 9 year old peanut allergic child.	experiential
but they haven't actually implemnted the policy they advertised of no peanuts.	non-experiential
and the bathrooms, armrests, overhead bins, you name it.	non-experiential
being asked to forgo peanut snacks for one flight, one snack, one meal is not a big deal for people when the cost of that snack could be a life.	unverifiable
because our plane from florida that connected was late.	experiential
we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat.	experiential
occam's razor - the simplest solution is usually the correct or most effective one.	unverifiable
we are not hysterical,	unverifiable
with this many variables to solve for, the simplest and most effective solution is a buffer radius of infinity .	unverifiable
with enough advance notification, they will withhold serving peanuts on our flight and provide an alternative snack for the passengers.	unverifiable
we also wipe our entire row of seats, tray tables, seat belts and the seat back in front of us with baby wipes when we board.	experiential
and there are a few organizations involved in the situation..	non-experiential
all fees should be disclosed upfront, in all advertising, and on all websites!  no exceptions!	unverifiable
oversized baggage charges should be based on a standard measuring system as opposed to contents;	unverifiable
and to be prepared to deal with the consequences of exposure should they decide to accept those risks.	unverifiable
here is an excerpt from the proposed rule:	non-experiential
now, air fare is affordable  and more available to citizens than ever before.	unverifiable
my granddaughter's peanut allergy was discovered from a kiss from her mother that had eaten a peanut butter sandwich.	experiential
people eating peanuts and touching the bathroom or left on the seats could cause a reaction at 30,000 feet.	non-experiential
the doctor says we can do that twice.	non-experiential
that won't save her if she is out over the ocean.	non-experiential
i endured an all-day wait without being advised of status.	experiential
people who did not arrive till 10am per prior instruction never heard that announcement.	experiential
follow the golden rule, treat passenger the same way you, the airline, would like to treated.	unverifiable
the fact that dogs and cats are now allowed and may be anywhere in the cabin, makes it possibly deadly for me.	non-experiential
making sure those compartments are comfortable is a good solution.	unverifiable
i am 72 years old and have medical problems.	experiential
so it's not a big deal during a flight.	unverifiable
airlines  should be required to honor the offered price for at least some number of minutes - at least 10 minutes.	unverifiable
but the price i get should be the price i'm offered - if there is a seat still available.	unverifiable
and sometimes i could be home or at my hotel in the time it takes me to get my bag at the baggage claim.	experiential
the  baggage handling process is too slow and inefficient for many frequent business travelers to use.	unverifiable
a peanut-free buffer zone is not sufficient protection from air that is circulated throughout a plane's cabin.	non-experiential
as far as i can tell, airlines are not legally liable for anything any more;	non-experiential
airports and airlines should have contingency plans which clearly separate their responsibilities,	unverifiable
but!  it should be made crystal clear to anyone who deplanes that it is his or her responsibility to get back before the plane departs.	unverifiable
no ifs ands or buts.	unverifiable
either a particular airplane should be peanut-free or not;	unverifiable
the initial rule limiting this practice was the single best thing for travelers that the dot has done in years,	unverifiable
but, what is also bad is that these fees are typically non-refundable, even if the airline fails to provide the service they are charging for.	unverifiable
this rule should include a requirement that fees are refundable for non-performance on the airline's part.	unverifiable
"i have visions of being stripped naked and put in little pods and put to sleep in order to keep everyone ""safe"" on flights."	unverifiable

airline revenues will probably go up	unverifiable

it will also be necessary for servicer's to transfer knowledge concerning any loan modification request in their pipeline.	unverifiable
also, no penalties should be applied if for some reason the homeowner does not make the payment on time to the new servicer, within 30 days from the notice of transfer to the new servicer.	unverifiable
in addition, there is a lpi flood product.	non-experiential
if a borrower does not have an escrow account for their loan , one is automatically created by the loan servicing system as soon as the loan is flagged to be placed in an lpi letter cycle.	non-experiential

by the time i have payed of my $ 200,000 loan i will have payed $ 500,000 total.	experiential
in early 2009 i asked for a 3 month deferment on the payments while awaiting my disability to go through  and payments to begin.	experiential
"* i was then told i qualified for a ""loan modification"" and that it would reduce my payments and interest rate and make them more affordable."	experiential
* i was advised not to send in any payments during the modification.	experiential
the bank would not accept them.	experiential
* i sent in the paperwork at least four dozen times and went through many steps and departments.	experiential
* we are a family of two adults and five children that are going to be put on the streets in cassellbery florida.	experiential
* this is a widespread problem and they might as well be getting away with murder doing this to people.	unverifiable
disability discrimination also.	unverifiable
* representatives from the insurance tracker should have to introduce themselves as the insurance tracker .	unverifiable
this set up also negates the servicing industry's claims that lpi premiums are so high because they are blindly insuring.	unverifiable
they also have all prior insurance information, claim information, etc.	non-experiential
especially as they have checked them and confirmed in writing that they were correct.	non-experiential
one would think they own fed ex as much as they use it.	unverifiable

just like with banking statements, a borrower should have the option to opt in for paperless.	unverifiable
since there's no physical mail involved.	non-experiential
the policy should be co-owned with both borrower and lender listed as beneficiaries of any reo policy especially if being billed to the escrow account,	unverifiable
anything less is the abuse of the fiduciary of escrow.	unverifiable
however, you are 100% correct that these policies should not be charged to the borrower's escrow account ,	unverifiable
the modification being offered is a financial incentive to remain a negative equity homeowner avoiding the investor from taking a financial loss from a foreclosure situation.	unverifiable

cfpb needs to understand that some servicers will take advantage of whatever rules you impose,	unverifiable
failure to do that after they received bailout funds from the governement means they are only interested in maximizing their profits and reducing their risk completely at the taxpayers expense.	unverifiable
lenders should no longer be allowed to call 20 times a day claiming you are late, while in the grace period for a payment if the loan is otherwise current.	unverifiable
but when you become a victim of a predatory servicer, you start to understand that they will do harm intentionally, as policy, and have no fear of being held accountable.	unverifiable
