dot's objective in setting this rule should be to eliminate all bumping, not merely achieve some  reduction.	unverifiable
regardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.	unverifiable
bumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.	unverifiable
"from that objective, it follows that there should be no cap on compensation and that the financial penalty to the airline should be strong enough to prevent bumping, not just keep it at some arbitrarily ""acceptable"" level."	unverifiable
the 100% of the total ticket price for expected arrival within 2 hours later is reasonable.	unverifiable
compensation for a longer delay should be the greater of 200% of the total ticket cost or the passenger's demonstrable out-of-pocket costs resulting from the delay  including any higher priced air ticket from the same or another carrier at the same class, and lodging, meals and incidentals at average prevailing prices in that metro area, and  with the obligation on the passenger to minimize those costs by arranging, with good faith help from the airline, an alternate flight or other means to get him or her to the destination as soon as reasonably practical.	unverifiable
i strongly support cash compensation for bumping passengers with zero-price tickets, e.g., those from frequent-flier programs.	unverifiable
dot's proposed rule using the lowest fare ticket would encourage airlines to bump those with zero-price tickets first,	unverifiable
since that cost would be lowest.	unverifiable
as long as they continue to offer tickets for miles, airlines should not be encouraged to treat passengers using those tickets as second-class when it comes to bumping.	unverifiable
the growing scarcity of actual seats for miles -- something that cries out for regulatory intervention -- is bad enough.	unverifiable
the proposals are certainly reasonable and should also be extended to include on-line booking services	unverifiable
since that could be a potential loophole for the airlines not to comply.	unverifiable
there is another growing problem that needs to be addressed, limitation on in-flight sales and solicitation.	unverifiable
one us carrier has mastered this art.	unverifiable
flight attendants are on the intercom from take-off to landing selling everything from mastercards to sandwiches.	unverifiable
i boarded usa in miami in march	experiential
and it was the coldest airplance i've ever seen.	experiential
moments later when the lady across the aisle asked for a blanket for her and her young child she was told they had no complimentary ones but could sell her two!	experiential
there is no question in my mind the reason the plane was so cold was to generate blanket sales.	experiential
this is just wrong.	unverifiable
what many people who are supporting a ban are forgetting  is if someone has such a severe peanut allergy that a reaction occurs when breathing or touching something else that has been contaminated , then *all* aircrafts that have ever had peanuts aboard are contaminated.	unverifiable
banning future peanuts doesn't change that cross-contamination is already in place and it's already a life-threatening environment.	non-experiential
not feasible.	unverifiable
but i do not expect the world to change for me.	unverifiable
i adjust to the world;	experiential
"if i think there's a chance that i will be exposed to my food ""poison, i don't go there."	experiential
it's inconvenient and sometimes a hardship for me,	unverifiable
but i'm the one with the allergy.	experiential
unfortunately, there are no guarantees in this world.	unverifiable
probably.	unverifiable
the problem is that banning peanuts alone won't make life on a plane safer;	unverifiable
and, frankly, those who don't have or know anyone who has life-threatening allergies have no idea how easily cross-contamination can occur.	unverifiable
as someone with such an allergy,	experiential
there's no way i would place my trust for my life on strangers to take precautions for my allergy.	unverifiable
banning isn't a real solution; finding a cure is.	unverifiable
it is unfortunate that the airlines have forced the government to step and and set limits by holding passengers hostage on the tarmac and treating them like items to be shipped and not people.	unverifiable
everyone is inconvenienced by flight delays, including the airline, the travelers and the airport.	unverifiable
consideration is what is needed here,	unverifiable
and the airlines have proven that they cannot be considerate to the travelers without a rule.	unverifiable
consequently, i believe a federal limit is necessary,	unverifiable
however i believe there are multiple factors that should be considered.	unverifiable
for instance, if a plane with 100 people on it has only 2 operating bathrooms, perhaps the timeframe should be shorter than a plane with more bathrooms in operation.	unverifiable
further, i would think the delay for a smaller plane that provides passengers with so little headroom that they cannot stand up without bending their heads  should be less than 3 hours.	unverifiable
the facilities on the plane could also be a factor .	unverifiable
however, if the airport is open and the airline does not intend to provide travelers with food, it is appropriate for the airline to let travelers off the plane so they can get food if the wait is long.	unverifiable
i see the reason for letting travelers deplane as being to allow them to obtain what they need and cannot get if they are held on the plane.	unverifiable
the only reason the airlines do not want to publish their plans in their respective contracts of carriage is because people may attempt to sue them if they fail to comply with those plans.	non-experiential
not that i believe people should sue at the drop of a hat,	unverifiable
but i do believe the travelers should have that as an option if the airline acts in an egregious manner.	unverifiable
thus, i believe airlines should be required to include their plans in their contracts of carriage.	unverifiable
i believe that airports should have tarmac contingency plans.	unverifiable
perhaps if both the airlines and the airports were required to have plans, the back and forth would lead to better coordination.	unverifiable
throughout all, i believe the airlines should inform their travelers about the situation regularly.	unverifiable
one reason for traveler angst in these situations is due to the lack of information.	unverifiable
setting traveler expectations is good.	unverifiable
however, airlines also must realize that sometimes the best decision is to let the travelers get off the plane and make other travel arrangements.	unverifiable
"i wholeheartedly agree with the idea that airlines should be required to provide travelers with a full-fare"" price."	unverifiable
this would allow travelers to compare prices between carriers and make better decisions.	unverifiable
a good alternative would be to allow an individual to choose what options they will use  and provide an all-in price that includes those options .	unverifiable
"this would allow travelers to determine what the ""all-in"" price includes, but would still allow the traveler to compare apples to apples when determining which airline to travel with."	unverifiable
all carriers that operate in the us should be required to display all-in fares for all flights that either begin or end in the us.	unverifiable
one result i could see here would be that an airline may allow one checked bag, but the size of the bag may be smaller for some carriers than others - and the charge for oversized bags may be more.	unverifiable
oversized bags may be something one doesn't think about until one gets to the airport and then finds out the bag is too big.	unverifiable
consequently, it might be good for a more prominent display of requirements on the traveler - e.g., bag size and weight.	unverifiable
"as to ""code share"" price display - as a traveler, i want to know what i am paying and what the restrictions on me would be."	unverifiable
i think, however, that it is important for me, the traveler, to know if the subcontractor has more restrictive luggage requirements that could cause me to need to pay additional fees.	unverifiable
i believe people want to know about the fees and restrictions when they arrange for travel.	unverifiable
i'm not sure it is necessary to advertise changes in fees or restrictions.	unverifiable
instead, i believe the fees or restrictions should not change for a passenger that has bought his or her ticket.	unverifiable
the contract between the airline and traveler is set when the ticket is purchased	non-experiential
if that contract allows the airline to change restrictions , the airline should be required to inform affected passengers that have already purchased tickets.	unverifiable
i think it is terrific that dot is, based on its experience with customer service plans, setting minimum requirements.	unverifiable
all of the requirements listed seem reasonable.	unverifiable
i would not want to fly with an airline that did not do those things.	unverifiable
with respect to the listed additional standards, i think it is important to note that if a bag is not delivered within 2 hours after the passenger landed on the first leg of a round-trip flight - it could be problematic.	unverifiable
whereas if it were delivered that late on the second leg of a round trip and the carrier later delivers it to the traveler's home it may not be such a big deal.	unverifiable
similarly, if the round-trip flight is over a long weekend, it is more important for the bag to catch up with the traveler quickly,	unverifiable
but if the round-trip is over a two week period in one place and the airline delivers the bag to the traveler within a day it may not be as big a deal.	unverifiable
refunds for bag fees on lost bags seems appropriate.	unverifiable
i also believe carriers should reimburse travelers for lost bags.	unverifiable
if the carrier fails to deliver a bag on-time, that also should be reimbursed -	unverifiable
"however i believe the definition of ""on time"" could be flexible."	unverifiable
it is important to carriers to publish on-time performance.	unverifiable
this is an important statistic used by some travelers to make choices about the carriers they wish to fly with.	unverifiable
also, the requirement to publish these statistics makes the carriers pay more attention to their achievements both individually and as compared to other carriers.	unverifiable
i have a peanut allergy and do not fly on airplanes very often.	experiential
however, my husband and i took a trip that required flying for travel	experiential
and i was very worried about the peanuts.	unverifiable
i took over-the-counter medicine to prevent a reaction and was very careful during the trip.	experiential
i can be as careful as i need to be,	unverifiable
but i can't help what the people around me eat.	non-experiential
i think that the two best ideas are banning nuts  from all flights, or having nut-free flights available .	unverifiable
when discussing an epinephrine auto-injector, i feel there should be one on the plane as part of the medical equipment, but should only be used in an emergency situation.	unverifiable
my doctor to me that if i use the epi pen, i have a few minutes to get to a hospital so they can regulate the epinephrine that's just been injected into my body.	experiential
this advice has caused me not to use the epi pen when i know that i can't get to a hospital in a short amount of time.	experiential
to me foods items, like a nut crusted chicken and rice dish will not bother me the way peanuts will.	unverifiable
peanut butter provides the same reaction,	non-experiential
"so peanut butter crackers would be out"" with a nut-free ban."	non-experiential
products containing peanut oil are a different matter.	non-experiential
"my doctor explained that the protein that i'm allergic to is broken down in the ""oil"" form,"	experiential
so foods cooked in peanut oil  do not bother me.	unverifiable
i think there should be no caps on amount airlines have to pay.	unverifiable
i agree with the proposed required customer service rules.	unverifiable
full prices should be fully disclosed up front,	unverifiable
and the lowest price available should be disclosed.	unverifiable
prices should not be increased after purchase.	unverifiable
dot should extend the tarmac delay rules to all flights in the us	unverifiable
on a recent trip from wa state to michigan, every single flight  was late by at least a half hour, resulting in missed connections both ways.	experiential
air travel has turned into such a frustrating exercise  that we look for reasons not to go air.	unverifiable
anything else whose risks of fatal reaction outweigh the mere convenience of the ignorant, i hope.	unverifiable
ricport, everyone is responsible for themselves and their effects on others.	unverifiable
airlines are not public spaces. if airlines ban peanuts, many passengers will bring their own peanuts on board ... as airlines cannot stop people from bringing their own snacks.	unverifiable
i am sympathetic to people with allergies,	unverifiable
but people with allergies need to be prepared with their medicine and then need to stop trying to impose their need on the 99% of the healthy  population.	unverifiable
* 30 minutes is too long;	unverifiable
so set the beginning info as 15 minutes with 30 minute updates unless a resolution is known sooner.	unverifiable
* specify notification be by all methods available at the airport involved, including ticket agents, with the customer additionally specifying how they are to be notified at home; email, phone, fax.	unverifiable
* all commercial flights should be included.	unverifiable
don't forget the obvious reasons they don't do better; no enlightened effective regulation; executive compensation; union rules; airport and faa inefficiencies; monopoly status ; ultimately the bottom line .	unverifiable
let's look at this logically:	unverifiable
the airline knows when they sell a ticket;	non-experiential
they know when they have sold the full number.	non-experiential
those passengers should be guaranteed a seat; no excuses.	unverifiable
any subsequent tickets sold should be sold as standby with a ranking 1-n, first come; first served!	unverifiable
problem solved.	unverifiable
* first ask for volunteers to receive the next available comparable or better seat on the airline or any other airline, the airline agents to make the arrangements and pay for the seat directly, the passenger to be reimbursed in cash or credit card for their anticipated out of pocket costs due to the delay and their total out of pocket flight costs, tickets, baggage checks, any other fees.	unverifiable
if points were used they would be reinstated with new expiration dates.	unverifiable
*  do a lottery, no limits, with at least  the results in 1., above, cash or credit cards only;	unverifiable
no vouchers,	unverifiable
* if they still bump someone the sky should be the limit, the results to be appropriate booking plus at least double  the payout in 2., above.	unverifiable
of course airline lawyers would attempt to make it five pages of weasel words.	unverifiable
disclosure, disclosure, disclosure!	unverifiable
not just the ticket price but also the agent's fee,	unverifiable
which sometimes is considerable.	unverifiable
and yes! they should not be able to raise the quoted price.	unverifiable
it makes no sense and is misleading to quote a one way price if i have to buy a roundtrip ticket.	unverifiable
"if the itemization is boston to bombay fare, then various fees, then bombay to boston fare and various fees, it is still misleading unless it is specifically preceded by ""round trip required"""	unverifiable
this whole process of additional regulation is brought about because of lack of disclosure by airlines and agents when they unbundle services and initiate obscene fees for them so that we buy tickets and still don't have a deal because we may still be hit by additional fees at checkin.	unverifiable
a deal should be a deal!	unverifiable
of course not.	unverifiable
i think we should always be talking about airlines, travel agents, and other resellers.	unverifiable
i think the smaller typeface is a bad idea.	unverifiable
small type is always used for something the purveyor has to say but doesn't want us to be able to read, and we usually can't.	unverifiable
no!  retroactive pricing is essentially fraud and violates the contract made when money changes hands.	unverifiable
i would favor a rule that disallowed even having a round trip requirement for prices.	unverifiable
if an airline wants to give a credit for roundtrip like stores give case discounts on groceries or such, and listed it as a separate credit in their advertising and on their ticket that might work.	unverifiable
fares from boston to new york might vary by time of day and by day of the week	unverifiable
but they should never be based on round trip required.	unverifiable
this is the same as bumping and should be compensated  as such.	unverifiable
see my comments under that category.	unverifiable
it is not just the five hours,	unverifiable
though that is bad enough;	unverifiable
it is all the other inconveniences, arriving late at night, having to cancel engagements, having to call a cab for a long ride vs bus transportation, and a myriad other inconveniences for which the airlines in their hubris currently accepts no responsibility.	unverifiable
the price of fuel doesn't change while i am trying to book a flight.	unverifiable
maybe airlines should only be allowed to change prices once a week, or once a day, always at midnight, or something like that.	unverifiable
"it is extremely frustrating to try to buy a ticket and have availability and or or price change while you are pushing the ""buy"" button."	unverifiable
since all these airlines are still split on what services call for fees and how much those services actually cost, they need to create a standard for every airline to use as a basis for quoting prices.	unverifiable
"go back a few years to what was considered ""standard"", and have them quote on: - rt airfare- 1 checked bag- advance seat selection- beverage service- taxes and fees"	unverifiable
from there, passengers can unbundle as necessary or add things like premium seating and 2nd or 3rd checked bags .	unverifiable
* although perhaps an improvement over current procedures, this will only help a portion of peanut or nut allergic people, and mostly likely won't help severely allergic individuals.	unverifiable
* airborne peanut or nut proteins can cause anaphylactic reactions faster than surface-bound peanut or nut proteins;	non-experiential
the recycled air in the plane exacerbates this problem.	non-experiential
* every surface could still be contaminated, even if you wipe down your seats; for example, touching any other arm rest, using lavatory doors, toilets, sinks, and surfaces right after someone else who was eating peanuts or nuts.	non-experiential
* there would simply still be too many risks.	unverifiable
* again, better than current procedures, and better than a buffer zone, but still a problem.	unverifiable
a peanut or nut allergic individual would likely be walking onto a plane that was not peanut or nut free 30 minutes prior;	non-experiential
and although some cleaning of the cabins occurs between flights,	non-experiential
many of the same issues mentioned above would still exist.	non-experiential
* most people don't understand and or or are not tolerant of peanut or nut allergy, purely out of lack of knowledge of its severity	unverifiable
prior to having a son diagnosed with peanut or nut and soy allergies i didn't know what it entailed either;	unverifiable
"* this has the potential to single out the peanut or nut allergic ""offender"" ."	unverifiable
* the only viable solution to make air travel routinely safe for everyone.	unverifiable
* although there may still be risks of passengers violating the policy,	unverifiable
this resolves all of the issues mentioned above.	non-experiential
the surfaces of and air inside the plane would be safe,	unverifiable
all travelers would know what to expect,	unverifiable
no one would know who was or wasn't peanut or nut allergic.	unverifiable
* airlines have nothing to lose by instituting a full ban;	unverifiable
they only have customers to gain.	unverifiable
like with any changes in air travel policy, if such a ban is universally instituted, everyone will have to accept it,	unverifiable
and it will not prevent people from continuing to fly.	unverifiable
however, what will happen is that a large and continuously growing part of the customer market that currently cannot or will not fly, will buy tickets knowing that air travel can be safe.	unverifiable
* bear in mind the severity of a situation where a peanut or nut allergic individual goes into anaphylactic shock mid-air.	unverifiable
in some cases, benadryl and an epipen  will resolve the reaction for an amount of time.	non-experiential
however, in many cases these measures merely buy you enough time to get to an emergency room, typically 10 to 15 minutes;	non-experiential
which would not be possible when in mid-air.	unverifiable
they are not sufficient, assuming that the goal here is to make air travel safe for everyone.	unverifiable
i don't think that flights of less than 60 should be covered:	unverifiable
in general passengers on these smaller aircraft get more personal service and it would be less cumbersome to deplane passengers if needed.	unverifiable
where a plane is at the gate and the aircraft door has not yet been closed, passengers should be permitted to deplane after, say, 1 hour.	unverifiable
in addition, passengers should be able to deplane if the plane has returned to the gate and the delay is over 1 hour.	unverifiable
in relation to deplaning delayed or diverted international passengers, i recall  facing exactly the same issue when traveling trans-pacific and transiting hawaii.	experiential
we were always able to deplane in hawaii as long as we remained within a certain area of the airport.	experiential
at least we were able to stretch our legs and use the bathroom facilities in the airport.	experiential
i agree with dot's proposals on clarifying bumping rules and adequately compensating those involuntarily bumped.	unverifiable
passengers who are voluntarily or involutarily bumped should be advised by the gate agents on the cash or check or travel voucher option and the criteria for involuntary bumping prioritization.	unverifiable
on compensation, i think the actual ticket amount, plus a small premium to cover the unbundled aspects of the costs associated with the trip would suffice.	unverifiable
given that these smaller aircraft service less popular routes , oversales should be prohibited,	unverifiable
"but the airlines should allow a few passengers to be on ""stand by"" in the event of a no show."	unverifiable
zero-fare tickets should be compensated by recrediting the passenger with the number of miles used for the journey, plus cash for minor overhead costs.	unverifiable
before talking about something being too harsh for the airlines, we have to decide what to do about the fact the airlines were all against a passenger bill of right.	unverifiable
if they didn't want something that would help it's customers, then customers should push for the harshest punishment possible.	unverifiable
charging extra for all checked bags ultimately causes passenger injuries.	unverifiable
the proposed rule is wise and good and forbids a despicable practice, but misses the larger issue of passenger safety.	unverifiable
charging for all checked bags encourages travelers to overload the overhead bins with large, heavy bags.	unverifiable
passengers are not professional baggage handlers.	unverifiable
baggage handlers don't hoist bags they can barely lift over passengers' heads.	unverifiable
passengers do this or pay $20-$40 extra per bag.	non-experiential
passengers are not as fit as baggage handlers, are not trained at all, and often can not lift their bags into the crowded overhead bins.	unverifiable
"many need wheels to move their ""carry on"" bags through the airport."	unverifiable
passengers frequently drop bags on other passengers while loading or unloading the bins,	unverifiable
these large bags, especially the wheels, hurt when a bag falls on your head.	unverifiable
please require airlines to allow for some generous weight in checked baggage.	unverifiable
the old limit of 75 pounds domestic was really nice,	unverifiable
but even 30 pounds would be more than plenty.	unverifiable
the passengers hate the baggage charge for many reasons.	unverifiable
it's not just the sleazy entrapment the proposed rule addresses.	unverifiable
it is a safety issue and should be regulated as such.	unverifiable
* yes, there should be uniform tarmac delay deadline to return to gate and allow passengers to exit the plane,	unverifiable
and it should be 2 hours, not 3 hours.	unverifiable
because the passenger comfort issue is equally bad  on smaller aircraft, or at any airport.	unverifiable
* making the tarmac contingency plan part of the contract of carriage would be much more good, than bad.	unverifiable
explicit written commitments are important, and are a competitive issue that passengers may care about in choosing a carrier for repeated trips.	unverifiable
or too often passengers will be stuck in an aircraft	unverifiable
because the airport will not provide a gate or other opportunity for passengers to deplane, when the time limit is exceeded.	unverifiable
* providing for a separate location in an international terminal is appropriate, to allow deplaning without passing through customs.	unverifiable
it does not seem unduly burdensome, given the length of many international flights and the consequent greater need to provide for passenger comfort during long delays.	unverifiable
* yes, dot should require that passengers be allowed to deplane for gate delays with door still open, or returns to gate for mechanical or emergency reasons.	unverifiable
asking passengers to remain in the immediate gate area to listen for boarding announcements, and expecting as passengers to be accountable to do so at the risk of missing our flight if we fail, is also reasonable.	unverifiable
the costs and operational concerns should be minimal, with all of this kept in mind.	unverifiable
"when an airline ""bumps"" a passenger it is, in essence, ""buying"" that ticket back from the passenger to sell it to someone else, and then ""purchasing"" a new ticket for the bumped passenger on the next available flight."	unverifiable
it follows that the airline should pay the prevailing market rate to purchase back the seat in the full flight.	unverifiable
bumping compensation should apply to all carriers because of the increasing use of regional carriers to serve smaller markets and their no lesser disruptiveness and potential expense to the traveler.	unverifiable
"passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being ""bumped."""	non-experiential
they should have a mandatory option of cash payment.	unverifiable
the proposed compensation limits are too low to provide an incentive to the airlines to limit overbooking and may be arbitrarily unfair to certain travelers.	unverifiable
the wall street journal recently re-proposed a 1977 proposal by the late economist julian simon of an auction that would offer bumped passengers a gradually rising reward for giving up their seat.	non-experiential
the arguments are rather compelling.	unverifiable
the airlines will overbook so as to optimize their financial results under any given set of caps,	unverifiable
so some passengers will still be involuntarily denied boarding on overbooked flights.	unverifiable
an auction will more accurately price the delay and the sellers  will be left with no complaint that it was involuntary.	unverifiable
an auction would also force the carriers to face the cost of overbooking in customer dissatisfaction and better inform their flight scheduling decisions.	unverifiable
i recall hearing seats being auctioned by progressive increases in the promised compensation by gate agents,	experiential
so perhaps those earlier rules should be revisited.	unverifiable
i support uniform regulations requiring both airlines and ticket agents to disclose all fees online  before purchase, for all flights and all carriers.	unverifiable
regulations should be as uniform as possible and applied uniformly.	unverifiable
on a flight with american airlines i was with my sister in law that is deadly allergic to peanuts.	experiential
i asked the flight attendant not to sell peanuts on the flight.	experiential
she came back with the regulation book explaining that the company policy was not to accommodate her.	experiential
i did clearly explain that if peanut dust is in the air it will cause her a sever assma attack.	experiential
they did nothing to help us and did offer to sell peanuts on the flight.	experiential
my sister in law took benadrel and was very scard for the entire flight.	experiential
she did get filled up but didn't have an attack.	experiential
she is very afraid to fly.	experiential
why don't they just serve snacks that don't have the potential  to kill someone!!!!!	unverifiable
i would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.	unverifiable
peanut reactions can be life threatening.	non-experiential
an individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.	unverifiable
they can have contact or inhalation reactions.	non-experiential
restricting to certain flights is not enough,	unverifiable
providing buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture, but from a practical point of view does not work.	unverifiable
i am a physician , and author on the subject.	experiential
i have free food allergy online support forums with 3000 members.	experiential
i would be more than willing to work with you in any way on this decision making process.	unverifiable
feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.	unverifiable
here is a link to that study	non-experiential
as this is my focus in a lot of my research,	experiential
and i have had much trouble finding examples.	unverifiable
i also think it should be noted that a lot of airlines do follow some of these rules on their own, and would most likely lose out on a lot of business without adopting such options.	unverifiable
that being said, if i would like to travel on the cheap, realizing that it could come at a cost of worse customer service, in a lot of situations, i'd be willing to live with poorer service for lower prices.	unverifiable
and i'm not doing anything this summer,	experiential
but i have done free market research for different papers and what not for school, and helped a professor with work on f.a. hayek and ayn rand.	experiential
so, nothing specifically about airlines, but markets and regulations in general, and most of what i have read  points to all evidence showing regulations being counter-productive.	non-experiential
this comment to me shows that we don't need regulation.	unverifiable
"if people behave the way that bernice does, choosing to no longer fly with an airline that does not provide adequate customer service, these customers ""vote"" with their money saying that this experience needs to be fixed,"	unverifiable
or else we will take our business elsewhere.	unverifiable
it really is in the airlines' best interests to serve customers well in order to retain customers and gain a good reputation to get more customers.	unverifiable
in a competitive industry, being able to separate your company as being better than the rest gives you a huge advantage.	unverifiable
without government control, businesses can, and will, do whatever they please, no matter how bad it is for their cusomers.	unverifiable
that's why we need regulations like this!	unverifiable
i, for one, don't mind seeing tax dollars go for this purpose!	unverifiable
i believe airlines should be forced to fully reimburse confirmed passengers whenever the airline changes flight schedules after booking.	unverifiable
i frequently reserve flights up to one year in advance, in order to secure the lowest price and best seat.	experiential
i do this even though the airline will charge me $150  to change my itinerary for personal reasons once booked.	experiential
however, the airline frequently change flight schedules for confirmed passengers without compensation, nor consideration of passengers' plans.	non-experiential
for example, a trip to europe on united airlines has now been changed 7 times by the airline since i confirmed my reservation in december 2009.	experiential
the resulting changes have added nearly 5 hours to the total trip,	experiential
plus i'm now required to leave at 3am for the airport ,	experiential
and i return after midnight, rather than a more reasonable 10:30pm.	experiential
in addition, united airlines has not offered to waive the change fee, nor provide seats on alternate dates or airline partners.	experiential
if i'm required to pay exorbitant fees to the airlines to change my original itinerary, due to personal circumstances, then the airlines should also be required to compensate inconvenienced passengers in full and provide satisfactory alternate travel arrangements comparable to the original flight schedule.	unverifiable
perhaps this would force the airlines to recognize the hardships they create for passengers when schedules are revised after passengers have already received confirmed flights and make related travel arrangements.	unverifiable
but sadly, too often it is too late then.	unverifiable
i do not back banning peanuts, but even in doubt, a child would get peanuts, when they can produce proof of no such allergy, if in doubt, give something else.	unverifiable
a law that prevents harm, does not have to be a blanket law.	unverifiable
it could be part of a passport.	unverifiable
aa was supposed to send a confirmation to my e-mail address and did not.	experiential
after the flight, i now have to jump through hoops to get a copy of the reservation for my use.	experiential
i needed to call spirit airline directly to get a refund for a paid reservation during their strike instead of having them automatically contact me about refunding my purchase price.	experiential
i am the father of a 5-year old with a severe peanut allergy as well as a physician and a medical epidemiologist.	experiential
while i have been fortunate enough to not experience an anaphylactic reaction in my son,	unverifiable
i have seen patients with anaphylactic reactions.	experiential
they are terrifying for everyone involved, even in situations where you are surrounded by trained staff, abundant medications and crash carts.	unverifiable
the way i see this issue is that it is balancing the risks and benefits of peanuts on planes.	unverifiable
the risks are pretty obvious and encompass death and less severe reactions that, at a minimum, are likely to result in an emergency landing.	unverifiable
the benefits of serving peanuts on planes are limited to the fact that most people like peanuts and they are fairly inexpensive.	unverifiable
i have seen on this discussion board arguments that people have the right to eat peanuts, that people with allergies should wear masks or other personal protective equipment , that people with allergies should not fly, etc...	experiential
these arguments seem somewhat petty, impractical, and outdated, respectively.	unverifiable
petty because it is not a major sacrifice to go without a bag of peanuts.	unverifiable
impractical because trying to keep an n95  mask on a young child for up to 6 hours just cannot happen.	unverifiable
outdated because in modern us society with families spread across the nation travel is often the norm.	unverifiable
for people who say 'just don't travel on planes', i assert that they are missing the point.	unverifiable
it is not as if dealing with a severe allergy is not already lifestyle altering.	unverifiable
i will never be able to take my son to a major league baseball park;	unverifiable
we will never be able to go down the street for ice cream on a hot summer day;	unverifiable
we cannot go to a chinese restaurant.	unverifiable
this is all ok	unverifiable
because these are luxuries.	unverifiable
furthermore, if we somehow do find ourselves in a hazardous situation, we can just get up and leave.	unverifiable
on an airplane, that is not an option.	unverifiable
there is no getting up and leaving .	unverifiable
so, the way i see it is that the risks associated with serving peanuts in a closed environment where the ability to provide medical care is limited clearly outweigh the benefits of serving peanuts both on a societal and cultural level	unverifiable
because the very real risk faced by children and adults with severe peanut allergies far exceeds the benefit of airlines serving peanuts.	unverifiable
this is a clear choice.	unverifiable
there is nothing that i am aware of that has not been recently publicized.	unverifiable
* peanut allergies are likely common;	non-experiential
* and serum ige testing likely overestimates the number of people with clinically significant peanut allergies.	non-experiential
still, this high rate of elevate ige could presage trends to come.	unverifiable
the major problem is that some cases of peanut allergy are obvious	unverifiable
while others are of uncertain significance.	unverifiable
but, it appears that the prevalence of children with clinically significant peanut allergy is increasing	non-experiential
which means in a few years that the prevalence will also increase in adults.	unverifiable
why the prevalence is increasing remains a mystery.	non-experiential
essentially, the key with this, as with everything in life, is to minimize risk while maximizing feasibility.	unverifiable
an absolute ban on peanut products is not currently possible,	unverifiable
but it is possible to increase the protection of passengers with life threatening allergies with minimal inconvenience to other passengers.	unverifiable
please everyone on this site, be reasonable, accommodating and, if possible, kind to others.	unverifiable
there is a question of practicality here.	unverifiable
peanut allergies  at the current time are becoming increasingly common in children.	non-experiential
while i appreciate that a person may require peanuts to be 'comfortable' as asserted by csleep2,	unverifiable
but i could be wrong -	unverifiable
airplane passengers embracing the concept of n95 masks on children may actually rejoice at the idea of 6 hours with a screaming child because, well, peanuts are just that important to their quality of life	unverifiable
and a brief peanut deprivation would quite simply be too devastating to even fathom.	unverifiable
i am actually focusing on feasibility and weighing risks against benefits .	unverifiable
but, yes, i do reject the concept that having a toddler suit and mask up for 6 hours is feasible.	unverifiable
i actually have,	experiential
and i found it quite uncomfortable.	unverifiable
critically, i have the willpower and the motivation to keep it in place	unverifiable
because i am an adult and have the ability to modify my behavior when faced with logical demands.	unverifiable
toddlers do not have this ability.	unverifiable
so now balance this against the idea of airlines needing to serve peanuts at 35,000 feet.	unverifiable
it seems fairly straightforward to me.	unverifiable
personally, if you want to bring your snickers bar on-board and eat it, that is fine.	unverifiable
but, i do not want to be sitting anywhere near you with my child when this occurs.	unverifiable
this is not a 'take it or leave it' approach, but rather a balanced approach that weighs risks versus inconvenience for peanut consumers.	unverifiable
individual masks are not a practical solution for the most vulnerable passengers.	unverifiable
i agree with steyermark's comments in many ways -	unverifiable
in my family, we read labels, understand where the labels may not give all of the information, etc...	experiential
this is not something that will be done by the majority of people.	unverifiable
also, foods like pbj sandwiches are really easy to fly with - no refrigeration required.	unverifiable
but, in the grand scheme of things, this is not that big of a deal.	unverifiable
a policy could consist of identifying those in close proximity to the peanut-allergic individual and giving them a handout that asks if they have peanut products that they are going to be eating.	unverifiable
if so, they should notify the flight attendant and some sort of seating rearrangement will occur in a way to maximize safety and minimize inconvenience.	unverifiable
this will require flexibility and generosity of spirit on the part of all people involved	unverifiable
but, in truth, is not that big of a deal when compared to a significant safety issue.	unverifiable
the other factor here is that i am, in truth, less worried about a nearby pbj sandwich or a snickers bar than i am about a bag of raw peanuts as these foods are less likely to have particles that go airborne.	unverifiable
but just that they pose less risk.	non-experiential
finally, if necessary, i am more than prepared to either 1 give an affected passenger food that we brought on the plane that is peanut safe if they are really hungry  or	unverifiable
will gladly fork over the additional $5-$50 to buy them or their family whatever in-flight food they want if it means that they will not expose my family to peanut allergens in close proximity.	unverifiable
i do not think it is possible at this time though.	unverifiable
i know that i will never feel secure when flying on a plane with my son , just as i am never secure in a restaurant and just as we always make sure to have his epi-pens with us.	unverifiable
the above would be a huge advance for people with food allergies,	unverifiable
and, maybe in the future, it will be able to go further.	unverifiable
but, for now, i do not see how it is practical.	unverifiable
it's very simple.	unverifiable
i should be able to buy a flight for the price advertised in large print.	unverifiable
if the ad says $49 from sfo to lax, then that's what i should be paying.	unverifiable
if it is not a one-way price, then it should be listed as $98 round trip.	unverifiable
if there are other fees, then the listed price should include those fees.	unverifiable
it's simple - just be honest.	unverifiable
this must be a very rare condition.	non-experiential
i've traveled extensively, both domestically and internationally, on airlines for fifty years and have never seen a person on an airplane have a peanut allergy attack.	experiential
also, this may be closing the barn door after the horse has run away.	unverifiable
i have celiac disease and hypoglycemia.	experiential
last time i flew, it was a fairly long flight	experiential
but the airline had informed us that food other than packaged snacks was to be offered.	experiential
i purchased some safe, gluten-free trail mix at the airport and tossed it into my carry-on	experiential
so that i could have something to eat.	experiential
it had dried fruit, nuts, and included peanuts.	experiential
my concern was gluten, not peanuts.	unverifiable
there was a child with a peanut allergy on the plane and not only did the flight crew refuse to serve peanuts to the entire plane,	experiential
but i was asked to put away the gluten-free trail mix i had just bought in the airport.	experiential
i would have eaten something else to keep my blood sugar up,	unverifiable
but every single snack on that plane other than the peanuts contained gluten.	experiential
i came off the three hour flight dizzy, sick, hypoglycemic, and furious.	unverifiable
if dot is going to restrict peanuts on planes it needs to be clearly communicated on the ticket and in advance.	unverifiable
it's easy to bring foods without peanuts but only if you know to do so.	unverifiable
"that should be ""no food other than packaged snacks."""	unverifiable
you have no idea what you're talking about either.	unverifiable
"celiac disease is not an ""allergy"" and someone sitting in the next seat eating pretzels poses no risk to a celiac."	unverifiable
on the off-chance there is turbulence and somebody's pretzel lands in my drink, i'm sure the airline would replace it.	unverifiable
not only advertise total fare- but whether or not the fare is refundable.	unverifiable
"also - beyond the fare - the airlines are adding ""fuel surcharges"" to almost all international fares."	unverifiable
the fuel surcharges need to be described as either refundable or non-refundable as well.	unverifiable
enough is enough.	non-experiential
the airports are obsolete,	unverifiable
the atc system is at least twenty years out of date,	non-experiential
there are too many people and too little capacity--	non-experiential
so adjust.	unverifiable
all advertising of fares must state a total price, inclusive, without limiting in any way the generality of either or both of the foregoing or the following, of every cost, fee, charge, tax, device, scheme, gimmick and ripoff, in clearly readable type, not less than 12 point , prominently in each such advertisement.	unverifiable
baggage isn't optional.	unverifiable
the daytripper is a distinct minority.	unverifiable
fares should include one  checked and one carryon, subject to size and weight limits.	unverifiable
right now the premium is on smuggling oversized and overweight baggage and robbing other passengers of scarce storage space	unverifiable
when it's in an airline contract of carriage.	unverifiable
the rule should require every air carrier to tell all plainly and clearly, and back it up.	unverifiable
i don't want the government to make a one-size-fits-all mandate	unverifiable
they're not so good at that.	unverifiable
just make the carriers tell it plainly and put it in the contract.	unverifiable
although dot does not seem to present this option,	non-experiential
i am most concerned about the byzantine price structuring for air fares that have no basis in actual cost of the service rendered.	unverifiable
air travel is a form of public transportation that is subsidized by taxes - and should be regulated as such when fares are set.	unverifiable
caps should be eliminated and actual monetary cost should be reimbursed - or an equivalent voucher for future travel should be provided.	unverifiable
if the traveler cannot be booked on a timely alternate flight, the compensation should be equal to the lost flight and some additional compensation - perhaps double the cost.	unverifiable
a flyer with concise and clearly stated rules and obligations of the passenger and the airline should be presented to any passenger in advance of a decision regarding compensation.	unverifiable
placing this information on the airline websites at booking - and on the e-boarding passes that most people print are other options to inform non-frequent flyers about their rights.	unverifiable
frequent-flyer miles should be refunded double their miles - to be in line with the compensation provided regular flyers.	unverifiable
i am 100% in favor of banning peanuts from planes.	unverifiable
i was in favor of this before my 3 year old was diagnosed with a peanut allergy	unverifiable
because i knew how serious reactions could be	experiential
and i certainly remain in favor now.	unverifiable
food allergies are becoming more and more common	non-experiential
and you can get food allergies at any point in your life	non-experiential
"so people should not think that this ""only concerns someone else or someone else's kid"""	unverifiable
because it could very well concern you and your family at some point...	non-experiential
people do not need peanuts to survive	non-experiential
but those who are allergic do need a peanut free area to survive.	non-experiential
if no one cares about anyone but themselves, at least realize that if peanuts are served on a flight and someone has a reaction, your plane will have to make an emergency landing.	non-experiential
that's not something that anyone wants.	unverifiable
handling tarmac delays requires coordination between the airline and the local airport.	non-experiential
the cause of the delay could be anything in the transportation system, ground or flight equipment problems, local or destination weather, crew issues,etc.,	non-experiential
but the accommodation of the passengers relies on the airport's ability to handle them.	unverifiable
therefore, the airline must work with each airport it serves to develop a plan for that airline at that airport.	unverifiable
a clause in the contract of carriage could require that the airline establish a tarmac delay contingency plan with each airport the airline uses.	unverifiable
furthermore, the airline must keep relevant ststistics about delays and their handling, conduct periodic reviews and revise the plan with the goal of improving customer satisfaction and reducing the causes for the delays .	unverifiable
i think anything more specific would be unworkable.	unverifiable
as an adult with a severe tree nut allergy,	experiential
i certainly empathize with the folks with peanut allergies.	unverifiable
that said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts given the likelihood of a serious reaction is fairly similar.	unverifiable
if the airlines could have precautions in place, such as keeping an epipen available or offering surgical masks to those who need then, that would be a positive step.	unverifiable
however, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker.	unverifiable
further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible.	unverifiable
unfortunately, personal responsibility and proactive steps on the part of the person with the allergy is likely the only viable solution.	unverifiable
there are times when it is obvious to the airline and passengers that a flight is going to be canceled	unverifiable
"and yet the airline often requires passengers to arrive at the airport in order to ""qualify"" for rebooking or refund."	non-experiential
it would make more sense that in order to avoid misery at the airport  airlines should allow passengers to rebook or refund when a cancellation or severe delay is imminent.	unverifiable
i'm sure that an algorithm can be developed and supported by software to create a baseline for appropriate situations.	unverifiable
my peanut allergic son flew with me on southwest when he was 3.	experiential
i carried him in, wiped the whole area down while holding him, etc. etc.	experiential
picked up the food all around	experiential
i had let sw know about his allergy on several occasions before we boarded	experiential
but nothing was done.	experiential
he didn't touch one thing	experiential
and he sat in his very large car seat the whole time.	experiential
about 30 min. into the flight, his eyes were swollen shut	experiential
and his face was bright red... just from breathing	experiential
"but all she said was ""i hope you have your medicine""."	experiential
this was a three year old!	experiential
it was really scary.	unverifiable
but i have never flown with him since.	experiential
it makes me really sad to hear all of your comments about banning other foods, animals, perfumes, etc.	unverifiable
you know that is not the intention.	unverifiable
how insensitive, especially to those of us who have lost a child or a loved one to such a small thing as a peanut.	unverifiable
no one would ever wish this upon their child.	unverifiable
it is not something we have chosen.	unverifiable
it is a dark shadow that we have to live with every day.	unverifiable
i would hope others are doing the same.	unverifiable
this is what has happened to us, just this month.	unverifiable
it's really sad.	unverifiable
i can't even tell my son about it.	unverifiable
i don't even care if someone brings them on board	unverifiable
but packaged peanuts are a different story.	unverifiable
the oils on your hands are on those fabric seats forever	unverifiable
and the peanut poof is in the ventilation system for everyone to breathe.	unverifiable
in regards to medicines, someone mentioned earlier about a defibrillator being on board.	non-experiential
they are prepared for heart problems	unverifiable
but a child's first reaction to peanuts is just as likely and deadly,	unverifiable
so maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to have one.	unverifiable
although, i can't imagine someone with a peanut allergy coming on board without their medicines.	unverifiable
on a side note, someone commented about how this would only effect 1% of the population.	non-experiential
but, i do know that out my family of 5, none of us can fly with my child...	experiential
so not only does my son not fly, but we don't.	experiential
i would venture to say that this is the same case for most families.	unverifiable
so, much more than 1% would be e or affected.	unverifiable
peanuts should never be banned anywhere!	unverifiable
if my kid's school were to attempt to ban them, they would be the target of a discrimination lawsuit.	unverifiable
food allergies are incredibly rare.	non-experiential
most people who believe they are allergic only think so because their parents misinformed them out of total paranoia.	unverifiable
i just have to say, yeah right.	unverifiable
foolish paranoia is the real illness in most supposed food allergy cases.	unverifiable
absolutely!	unverifiable
i think the fact that she survived the people next to her having peanuts indicates that the fear is baseless.	unverifiable
southwest does serve peanuts  unless you impose your paranoia on the rest of us and request a peanut free flight.	non-experiential
allergist has an agenda.	unverifiable
the fact that he has never reacted is more telling than any suggestion by the self-servig allergist.	unverifiable
more than 31 people drop dead each day for no reason.	non-experiential
food allergies are so rare,	non-experiential
that the rest of the world should not concern themselves.	unverifiable
other than death by choking, it is not a fact that peanuts kill people.	non-experiential
it is a fact that they provide a very nutritious snack that children will actually eat.	unverifiable
highly unlikely that you and two of your offspring actually suffer from the same allergy.	non-experiential
allergies are not genetic.	non-experiential
therefore, i must classify you as a hypochondriac.	unverifiable
unfortunately your paranoia is robbing your kids of one of the most nutritious foods  on the planet.	unverifiable
so true!	unverifiable
i see this all the time.	experiential
they try to ban peanuts at school	non-experiential
because some over anxious mom saw something on tv about food allergies	unverifiable
and that became her kids affliction du jour.	experiential
the 3 living humans who are actually in danger just need to stay in a bubble and leave the rest of us in peace.	unverifiable
we have tons of anecdotal evidence,	non-experiential
but this is one where hard, verifiable, replicable evidence is needed.	unverifiable
if peanuts are life-threatening, then surely there are cost-efficient equivalents.	unverifiable
"frankly, i avoid airlines ""snacks""--"	experiential
they interfere with my drinking.	unverifiable
my 9 year old peanut-allergic son had his last major exposure 2 years ago when he touched a smear of peanut butter left under a tabletop where someone else had touched.	experiential
he then wiped his hand on his jeans and then touched his ear and his cheek.	experiential
all without realizing it was peanut butter he'd touched.	experiential
he immediately broke out in horrible hives	experiential
and i gave him benadryl and got him home, stripped and bathed.	experiential
all the while, i was watching for breathing problems and other signs of anaphylaxis.	experiential
this is why i don't support buffer zones alone.	unverifiable
they don't address peanuts stuck down in cushions, left in seatbacks or peanut product oils left, well, anywhere by earlier passengers or flights.	unverifiable
"i don't feel it is a viable solution as a ""peanut-free"" flight could follow a ""peanut-allowed"" flight on the same plane."	unverifiable
leaving peanuts in cushions and peanut residue on everything from the prior flight.	unverifiable
this is a very good point and a lot of parallels can be drawn.	unverifiable
i think the problem, as seen with jjm, is that some people don't view peanuts in the same category as guns and cigarettes.	unverifiable
these things kill.	unverifiable
just because they  won't kill you doesn't make it your right to expose others to it.	unverifiable
it's a matter of education.	unverifiable
we'll get there.	unverifiable
this dialogue is a good step.	unverifiable
risk of exposure is reduced	unverifiable
which is not as good as eliminated but is better than full exposure.	unverifiable
i see the parallel with these flight proposals.	unverifiable
ban peanut products.	unverifiable
"yes, people will ""sneak"" them."	unverifiable
however, the risk will still be reduced over the nothing that we are doing now.	non-experiential
i think a buffer-zone would be a more realistic approach to the issue than select peanut-free flights.	unverifiable
the fact that you are uninformed does not mean the evidence does not exist.	unverifiable
a willingness to go without peanuts for the duration of a flight is a small show of civility and empathy.	unverifiable
our family flies regularly and internationally.	experiential
it would be a life-saving and life-changing regulation if peanuts were banned on all flights.	unverifiable
it is good for your personal growth to be able to think of other people's needs.	unverifiable
my son has a severe peanut allergy diagnosed by respected allergy doctors	experiential
so it is not paranoia.	unverifiable
the part about food allergies  is that each reaction can be different.	non-experiential
one exposure can simply lead to hives or vomiting, while another exposure can trigger full anaphylactic shock	non-experiential
which may be fatal, if untreated.	non-experiential
this issue is not a joke or to be taken lightly.	unverifiable
the epi-pen emergency medication is  effective for 15-20 minutes per dose before the patient needs to get to the hospital.	non-experiential
if you were on the plane with my son and he has an allergic reaction on a flight from the east coast to the west coast, he would need to take several epi-pens in case an emergency landing would be necessary.	unverifiable
i wish no one would have to deal with this issue.	unverifiable
i don't relish the fact that we would inconvenience other travelers,	unverifiable
but i think that if it was your child you may think differently.	unverifiable
we deal with this on a daily basis and have only travelled by plane one time.	experiential
we contacted the airline in advance, found the first flight of the day to ensure the plane was as clean as possible, took several epi-pens, covered the seats with towels and worried the whole time and that was only 1.5 hours.	unverifiable
my vote would be to ban peanuts and peanut products only on a flight where a passenger with a peanut allergy requests a peanut-free flight in advance.	unverifiable
get serious.	unverifiable
maybe some passengers like peanuts.	unverifiable
why not just require the flight attendants to warn you, and only give you peanuts if you ask for them.	unverifiable
the same for anything containing peanut products.	unverifiable
i think opening the floor for public comment is helpful on so many levels.	unverifiable
those of us dealing with food allergy issues on a day-to-day basis feel that the opportunity to have our voices heard is exactly what we would wish for.	unverifiable
those in the public who do not or have not lived with this issue can see a variety of viewpoints and develop an informed opinion.	unverifiable
i believe that our cultural expectations need to be re-assesed when considering food allergy issues.	unverifiable
* food is sustenance	non-experiential
* we associate events or environments with food	unverifiable
if i eat this food, i may seriously jeopardize someone's well-being.	unverifiable
i believe that good faith is being shown in evaluating the peanut allergy issue,	unverifiable
i strongly encourage you to contact and work in tandem with the food allergy and anaphlyaxis network, t_url	unverifiable
i believe that people generally care about the well-being of others, and when informed, make informed choices.	unverifiable
what industry other then approved monopolies have this privilege.	unverifiable
as consumers we are not given full information of costs,	unverifiable
we can be bumped at the airlines discretion,	non-experiential
and they can sell non-existent seats without fear of refund.	non-experiential
the dot is failing us by allowing airlines to over sell and issue non-refundable tickets.	unverifiable
the dot should require all tickets to be fully refundable  and allow the airlines to oversell.	unverifiable
i believe that the airlines should be required to pay 5 times the full ticket price	unverifiable
this will act as a disincentive and return sanity and civility to the experience.	unverifiable
"payment should be required to be  released immediately at the gate in the form of ""as good as cash"" medium upon being advised of bumping."	unverifiable
the non-revenue tickets should be considered as those that are bought.	unverifiable
"it is already impossible to travel on earned ""miles"" ."	non-experiential
if the airlines would guarantee 30-35% of the aircraft seating  as mile redeemable priority seating that would be another story.	unverifiable
but as it stands currently unless you are considering flying to a war zone in the middle of the night on sunday you never can find a revenue free seat.	unverifiable
the bottom line is that you cannot trust the airlines to be customer friendly until their actual revenue stream is threatened by thei bad behavior.	unverifiable
small aircraft should not be over-sold, period!	unverifiable
finally, along with the ticket and in the same size font full disclosure of bumping regulation should be provided.	unverifiable
that way the customer has the information in hand and is able to ensure that he or she is properly advised.	unverifiable
there has also been many reported incidences of credits taking months if not years to be provided by airlines.	non-experiential
the dot should require instantaneous credits.	unverifiable
our debit or credit cards should be credited within the same time frame as they were debited for the original purchase.	unverifiable
any delay should warrant a substantial fine.	unverifiable
interpretations should never be left to the side that is contracted and paid to provide the service.	unverifiable
we have seen that behavior with the cable companies	non-experiential
we have enough modern technology to insure that lost bags are a rare exception.	unverifiable
if the passenger cannot get to his or her destination within  2 hours of the scheduled arrival the traveler should have the right to have a refund for any ticket immediately and on the spot and for the amount paid inclusive of all fees.	unverifiable
if they want to publish the history tat is fine as long as it is accurate and certified so by a third party.	unverifiable
there is absolutely no reason to prevent a traveler from suing.	unverifiable
whichever regulation that governs foreign carriers that is more favorable to the traveler should be the effective one.	unverifiable
size has no relevancy as far as i am concerned.	unverifiable
all foreign airlines flying into or out of the us airspace should be bound by the same rules.	unverifiable
it is but a fraction of what the airlines spend to misrepresent their service to the gullible flying public.	unverifiable
add that to the amount of legal gymnastics the public is put through to seek recovery of costs due to non delivery of service.	unverifiable
and while there the tortoise-like speed of having a  credit card  debit reversed.	unverifiable
i have no problem with near regulation of the industry again.	unverifiable
while the passenger has a right to know what fees are being charged by the airlines,	unverifiable
when the ticket is purchased, it should be inclusive of any and all fees.	unverifiable
i have always been opposed to carry-on bags that don't fit under the seat.	unverifiable
if the carry-on is too large to fit, then the passenger should be charged a fee for those carry-on bags.	unverifiable
i agree with the comments that mthornt1 has posted.	unverifiable
there is never an excuse for leaving an aircraft on the ground for more than 3 hours;	unverifiable
rather, an airline's choice to do so is likely governed by the cost of returning the aircraft to the gate.	unverifiable
the rules should apply to all carriers and all airports.	unverifiable
further additional rulemaking should insure that when aircraft are on the ground, whether at the gate or not, adequate climate control and airflow be required in addition to access to toilets and water.	unverifiable
additional rules should require carriers to allow access to one another's gates on a barter basis or at reasonable cost if there is a need to deboard an airplane.	unverifiable
lastly, penalties for violations should benefit the affected passengers ' only when there is a direct cost to mistreating and delaying passengers will there be a sufficient incentive for carriers to treat passengers humanely.	unverifiable
it's about time that passengers had some sort of recourse.	unverifiable
imagine being stuck in china without a change of clothes.	unverifiable
thanks a lot airlines	unverifiable
i think airlines know well in advance which flights are subject to being over sold and have repeated bumping.	non-experiential
for repeated bumping on the same flight same day of the week three or more weeks in a row, the specified compensation should double.	unverifiable
airlines should also notify passengeres when a flight is being significantly oversold and offer the denied boarding compensation in advance of the departure date for say 50% of the denied boarding compensation rate payable at the gate to reduce bumping from overbooking.	unverifiable
yes finally i have been doing this flying to and from for three years.	experiential
this is one of the best things that dot has done in the past three months.	unverifiable
i was stuck on a flight for three hours on the tarmac while it was thunder and lighting just sitting.	experiential
why now finally something has been done.	unverifiable
this alone would put a huge dent in the unfair practice of bumping passengers who expect the airline to get them to their destination in time and on the right flight.	unverifiable
it is very inconvenient to have to contact friends and family at your destination that you will be arriving late or not at all because you were bumped.	unverifiable
friends and family on many ocassions have taken time off to meet you.	unverifiable
a previous comment stated that airlines are private companies and should not be micro-managed.	non-experiential
i do not want to be stuck on the tarmac or at the gate for more than 2 hours without the option of de-planing.	unverifiable
i want to be able to choose another flight, drive to my destination, or come back another day.	unverifiable
"i do not want to feel like a prisoner of the ""private airline companies""."	unverifiable
right of carriage does not include right of incarceration!	unverifiable
i have an issue with airlines changing my flight after i booked, and leave me no recourse.	unverifiable
i booked a flight in november from orlando to texas to ca.	experiential
the airline decided to cancel my flight and book me through boston instead.	experiential
but they were able to put me through jfk - not much better.	unverifiable
it has happened 3 or 4 times to me - and not always the same airline.	experiential
all the problems described in this survey are due to the fact that, in reality, there is minimal competition in the air transportation field in this country.	unverifiable
the cabotage regulations, promulgated at the infancy of the industry to protect us carriers from foreign competition guarantee that the airlines can inflict anything on the public without fear that their clients, who most times have only one or two other carriers flying from one city to another, can go to a competitor.	unverifiable
this anti-competitive environment might have been needed years ago.	unverifiable
in the 21st century it is time to allow competition from foreign airlines, that already have flights to practically most us cities to carry passengers from, at least their first gateway city withing the us to their final destination.	unverifiable
this way, the most congested routes, for example miami to new york city, or new york to san fransisco, will have plenty of flights available to prospective passengers.	unverifiable
foreign airlines already fly between those cities, most times half or three quarters empty.	non-experiential
let us utilize these empty seats at a logical price without being subjected to the whims of the us airline monopoly.	unverifiable
there should definitely be a cap and not this hideous amount between $800 and $1200.	unverifiable
$400 is enough compensation and is probably a fair average of a one-way fare.	unverifiable
i checked in a passenger on a $98.00 fare from east coast to las vegas the other day;	experiential
"i hardly think he should get $800 or up to $1200 to ""compensate"" him if he were bumped."	unverifiable
my child is 2 years old and he is severely allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, egg and milk.	experiential
my son has reacted to airborne particles from someone opening a bag of nuts near him.	experiential
my husband and i used to be world traveler's and dreamed of traveling with our son.	experiential
or if he does it may cost him his life.	experiential
this is a disability, no question about it.	unverifiable
we are talking about being in the air with peanut particles being circulated through the cabin and possible no place to land for hours.	unverifiable
an epi-pen only last 15 minutes.	non-experiential
peanut allergy is unpredictable.	unverifiable
the first reaction could be mild and the second could cause your blood pressure to drop like a rocket, your throat to close up and your heart to stop beating.	non-experiential
yes, we carry epi-pens everywhere we go,	experiential
but even 10 wouldn't be enough on an airplane.	unverifiable
i know that airplane or not you could be somewhere where peanuts are opened.	unverifiable
the point is, you can't leave an airplane and get away from the peanut dust.	unverifiable
you can leave other areas and get away from it.	unverifiable
also, we do not chose to be anywhere we know there will be a lot of people eating peanuts, like ball games or restaurants that have them on the floor of their establishments.	unverifiable
it's not going to cost you your job if you choose not to go to a ball game or certain restaurant.	unverifiable
but i know plenty of people who would die if they do have peanuts or breathe in peanut dust.	experiential
i support a ban on all peanuts and peanut products on airplanes and an announcement to all passengers asking them to refrain from eating peanut products during the flight.	unverifiable
compensation should be kept with a dollar amount basis,	unverifiable
as the amount of the fare may not be suitable to cover expenses, such as food or lodging.	non-experiential
smaller aircraft do need compensation,	unverifiable
however it should be based on what the alternative travel options are.	unverifiable
typically, a smaller connecting flight will be either close to home, or close to the destination,	unverifiable
where the traveler may want to opt for a rental car or taxi instead.	unverifiable
zero-fare tickets may not need monetary compensation,	unverifiable
as they did not pay out of pocket for the flight,	non-experiential
but in addition to being re-booked, the miles or points redeemed should be credited back to the account.	unverifiable
it would not be fair for people using zero-fare tickets to walk out with cash-in-hand.	unverifiable
the biggest issue with overbooking is that people are not informed of their options.	unverifiable
"the full flight information is not disclosed when the ""next flight"" time is given."	unverifiable
"i would like to see a printed overbooking or bumping policy at the agent counter available, as well as the agents being up front with the customers when asking for volunteers, such as, ""we are overbooked by 7 passengers. we are looking for volunteers, etc..."""	unverifiable
my recent experience with an overbooking, they were looking for volunteers,	experiential
and i hesitated	unverifiable
because i saw a few people already list their names.	experiential
i did not know if they needed more.	unverifiable
also, they only announced that the next flight was just over an hour later.	experiential
they did not mention the fact that the flight was not nonstop like the one we were listed on, but with a 5 hour layover.	experiential
these are usually taxes or fees collected on behalf of the us or other governments and include such fees as border crossings, customs and agricultural inspection, taxes on ticket fares, security charges, airport use, etc.	unverifiable
when a ticket is canceled, these services are not used and the governments and other public facilities entitled to the fees do not receive them.	non-experiential
in effect, the airlines are stealing and pocketing money they collect on behalf of government entities!	unverifiable
our daughter is even allergic to airborne peanut dust in a plane when other people open their bag of complementary peanuts in the opposite end of the plane... gasping for air and almost choking.	experiential
once she told the cabin crew about her allergy at the gate and again when she got on the plane.	experiential
the result... they gave her a handi-towel and told her to wipe the armrests of her seat off.	experiential
even the people sitting next to her.	experiential
i think it's important to stress the real reason that aircraft is not returning to the gate.	unverifiable
they are not being paid while sitting at a gate.	non-experiential
and 3 hours is too long to keep people on a grounded airplane.	unverifiable
i fly 2-4 times a year and will avoid flying if possible.	experiential
i am allergic to all nuts.	experiential
the allergy is airborne.	non-experiential
from consuming a mislabled product i almost died and required immediate er care.	experiential
when i fly, my biggest concern is the amount of nuts on the plane,	unverifiable
because the more nuts, the stronger the reaction.	non-experiential
if airlines could just be required to make an announcement asking people to voluntarily not consume nuts on a flight, and not be responsible for enforcing it, even that would make a difference in my ability to live through a flight.	unverifiable
i only fly jet blue, they only serve cashews as snacks and sometimes will substitute another snack if i request in advance	experiential
when they refuse i do not get on the plane.	experiential
what i have started doing is handing out preprinted cards that explain my allergy.	experiential
i pass them out at the gate as people are waiting to board.	experiential
the vast majority of people were very open and cooperative.	unverifiable
so, the majority of the plane was nut-free.	non-experiential
there may have been one person who consumed nuts,	experiential
so i don't think there was.	unverifiable
however, letting all the people know is better than not telling them,	unverifiable
because most people are understanding and don't want to risk emergency landing.	unverifiable
if the dot just asks airlines to make that announcement, and then leave it up to passengers to comply, that would be a step in the right direction.	unverifiable
i bring lysol wipes on board every flight and clean my row off in preboarding.	experiential
i bring two epipens, benadryl, and my health insurance info.	experiential
i always call ahead at least twice and write down the time and date and the name of the representative i spoke with about my allergy.	experiential
this is what many have to do in order to fly.	unverifiable
maybe dot should mirror the same process for allergens.	unverifiable
i think peanuts should be banned from planes.	unverifiable
i don't care about them one way or the other, and if it would allow someone with a peanut allergy to fly, then great!	unverifiable
i do not know of any other food allergies that can be lethal without consuming the food.	unverifiable
peanut allergy can be deadly even if a person just breathes the vapor or dust.	non-experiential
on the other hand, i doubt there is anyone who will die if peanuts are not allowed on a flight.	non-experiential
there are many other foods that can be consumed as a snack without endangering anyone's life.	unverifiable
i know i risk upsetting pet owners,	unverifiable
i believe that larger pets are still accommodated this way on most airlines.	non-experiential
i have a great deal of empathy for those who have, or are related to someone who has, severe peanut allergies.	unverifiable
clearly, their health is much more important that my desire to snack on peanuts for a few hours,	unverifiable
and i doubt many people could debate that.	unverifiable
i was on a southwest flight not long ago, where a mom demanded that peanuts not be served on her flight with her daughter.	experiential
the flight attendants complied.	experiential
"mind you, this was southwest airlines, which had the marketing tagline ""we fly for peanuts"" for years."	experiential
common sense dictates that if your daughter has a severe peanut allergy, you don't fly southwest.	unverifiable
even if the crew agrees to suspend peanut service for this flight, the last flight served peanuts.	experiential
there are discarded peanut bags in the seat back pocket in front of your daughter.	experiential
peanut dust is on the seats, in the ventilation, and everywhere else.	non-experiential
on the same flight i, and many friends of mine who also travel frequently, each had a bag of nuts in our carry-on.	experiential
forget for a moment that it would be impossible  for flight crew to prevent people from eating their own snacks while flying.	unverifiable
the slippery-slope potential here boggles the mind.	unverifiable
sorry, sir, you can't board this flight.	unverifiable
you will never convince peanut allergy sufferers or their families that this should not be controlled,	unverifiable
and i can see their point without agreeing with it.	unverifiable
i am violently allergic to dogs and cats,	experiential
yet most mass-market airlines now allow pets to be stowed in the passenger compartment.	non-experiential
i don't recall anyone ever asking me if my health would be compromised by allowing pet dander aboard.	experiential
i don't protest,	unverifiable
if i choose to fly, i alone must be responsible for my own health.	unverifiable
"as much as allergens might affect me, other people have rights too; and to twist around a well-known saying, ""my rights end where your nose begins."""	unverifiable
travel vouchers are similarly valued at the airlines' discretion, even when a dollar value is specified.	non-experiential
i was recently voluntarily bumped from a us airways flight, after being promised that the travel voucher was good for flights with any of their codeshare partners.	experiential
well ... contrary to what the gate agent told me, the voucher is only good on us airways-coded flights;	non-experiential
and as i live in the southwest,	experiential
there's a very good chance this voucher will expire worthless.	non-experiential
good for the airlines, not so good for me.	unverifiable
because the gate agent would not give me the voucher - and let me read the fine print - until the plane had pushed back from the gate.	experiential
i've experienced tantrums from fully grown adults	experiential
because they were restricted in their peanut consumption in daycare environments.	experiential
i'd rather not have this experience on a flight.	unverifiable
my daughter will only fly on peanut-free planes	unverifiable
if peanut is on the ingredients list, the item should be banned.	unverifiable
made in a peanut facility is fine and the allergic individual should know not to consume the item.	unverifiable
as far as i understand it, highly processed peanut oil is safe.	unverifiable
didn't think so.	unverifiable
most food allergies are imagined.	unverifiable
you clearly have a financial interest in promoting the myth of food allergy.	unverifiable
if someone is actually that allergic, they should stay home and not inconvenience the rest of us.	unverifiable
you are right on sir!	unverifiable
most of these supposed allergies are the paranoid imaginings of over anxious parents.	unverifiable
the rest of the public should not be forced to accommodate them.	unverifiable
a hive or two is not going to kill little jimmy,	unverifiable
"and the previous poster ""shoeslut"" should have her head examined for panicking like that."	unverifiable
she is causing more harm to her child by being such a paranoid freak than any peanut ever will.	unverifiable
finally the voice of reason.	unverifiable
while i still dispute whether your reaction will be as severe as you believe,	unverifiable
at least you realize that it is your responsibility to take precautions.	unverifiable
your ailment is not shared by the general population,	unverifiable
and should not be an excuse to infringe upon the rights of others.	unverifiable
first off, you do not have a 'fatal' peanut allergy - you are still alive.	unverifiable
maybe you have a 'potentially fatal' allergy - extremely unlikely, but possible.	unverifiable
your only viable solution - don't fly.	unverifiable
absolutely correct.	unverifiable
allergies are largely the realm of the hypochondriac.	unverifiable
get a real doctor to diagnose this - not an 'allergist' as they have an agenda to promote.	unverifiable
these peanut people are just a new kind of pc nazi.	unverifiable
if you really have a problem, don't fly!	unverifiable
what is hard to believe is that you feel perfectly fine inflicting your unfounded paranoia on the rest of us.	unverifiable
these days everyone seems to want to think they belong to a special needs group of some kind.	unverifiable
and suddenly you have a life threatening allergy.	unverifiable
you can't go to a job interview anyway,	unverifiable
because anywhere you go you will be exposed to peanuts.	non-experiential
'most' schools are not succumbing to this foolish paranoia - just the ones run by pc nazi whackos.	unverifiable
i tell you what, anyone tells me i can't feed my kid the one nutritious snack she will actually eat better be prepared for a lawsuit and a black eye.	unverifiable
absolutely correct.	unverifiable
unfounded fear is paralyzing this country and taking the enjoyment of life away from an entire generation of children.	unverifiable
far less that 1% of the population actually has a severe allergy.	non-experiential
oh yeah, the kid had a reaction at 3yrs. old.	unverifiable
it is almost certain that by 5yrs. he will have outgrown the sensitivity.	unverifiable
how about zero.	unverifiable
this is a non-issue.	unverifiable
peanuts are harmless.	unverifiable
methinks you have an agenda.	unverifiable
highly suspicious that the child of a physician who is hyper aware of bad things that can happen coincidentally has not one, but three life threatening allergies.	unverifiable
food allergies have to be the most overblown imagined health problem of our time.	unverifiable
hypochondriacs all.	unverifiable
"i sincerely doubt you ""know plenty of people who will die if they do have peanuts or breathe in peanut dust""."	unverifiable
almost no-one is actually that allergic.	unverifiable
lot's of people think they are much worse off than they really are.	unverifiable
while notifying customers of delays as soon as is feasibly possible is an admirable goal,	unverifiable
i wonder if delays of 30 minutes would actually affect passenger behavior.	unverifiable
in my experience it usually takes about 30 minutes to get to major airports,	experiential
in which case, killing 30 minutes at home or at the airport makes little difference - especially when security lines make you leave way earlier than your expected flight.	unverifiable
maybe it would be a better use of the airlines resources to focus efforts on notifying passengers of delays that are 2 hours or more as soon as possible.	unverifiable
one way dot could help inform passengers of bumping process and compensation for voluntary  bumping is through the use of gate television screens.	non-experiential
for example, at united airline's hub locations, they have television screens which clearly show the standby list, your place on the standby list, and how many have checked in.	non-experiential
adding another screen to televisions like this that indicate bumping may be an easy and effective way of implementing dot's new rule.	unverifiable
often in these situations there is a long line of people in similar positions or who need different kinds of help.	unverifiable
requiring the gate agent to recite a litany of conditions will probably just delay flights more.	unverifiable
people can read the fine print;	non-experiential
if they don't, that's their problem	unverifiable
and they should deal with the consequences.	unverifiable
i am definitely in favor of requiring airlines to list the total price upfront.	unverifiable
often i think i have a great deal, but then discover that it's not so great after all when the taxes and fees add up to almost as much as the ticket itself.	unverifiable
it might be good for airlines to be required to itemize the taxes and fees too,	unverifiable
since i never have any clue what they cover.	unverifiable
i am not sure how this may fit in here,	unverifiable
but there needs to be greater regulation of carry-on items across all airports.	unverifiable
additionally, gate agents do not enforce carry-on bag regulations in terms of size and number.	non-experiential
this is a huge pain for other passengers	unverifiable
who then cannot find a place for their bags	non-experiential
because one person has taken up an entire overhead bin.	non-experiential
while i don't advocate making people pay more fees,	unverifiable
i think that if passengers are found to have bags that are too big to carry-on at the gate, they should at least pay a partial fee to check them on like everyone else who paid to check their bags on.	unverifiable
however, if passengers are forced to check their carry-ons due to limited overhead space, then there should be no fees for them.	unverifiable
all flights should be covered --	unverifiable
it's no more tolerable being trapped on the tarmac at a small airport than at at large one!	unverifiable
nor any difference if it's a domestic or international flight!	unverifiable
the passenger experience is the same!	unverifiable
yes, all these dot proposals should be enacted.	unverifiable
1 advertised prices should reflicct the entire price that must be paid.	unverifiable
2 optional services should be opt-in	unverifiable
3 post-purchase increases should be permitted only if the purchaser is permitted to cance or change plans without penalty.	unverifiable
the problems with passenger experience are not dependant on aircraft size!	unverifiable
the buffer zone solution would not give me any confidence.	unverifiable
in a buffer zone situation the person could still be exposed to peanut residue in other parts of the plane .	non-experiential
now we carry wipes and wipe down every surface in our seating area and in the restroom when we fly an airline like southwest that serves peanuts on previous flights even if they aren't serving it on ours.	experiential
i would like to see the airlines stop serving peanuts.	unverifiable
having them not serve peanuts when my children are going to be on a particular flight doesn't do much for us.	unverifiable
if they have served 200 people 200 little bags of peanuts on the 200 previous flights.... - it makes my skin crawl.	unverifiable
"we can live with them serving other foods that ""may"" contain peanuts."	unverifiable
"it would be nice if they at least had one ""safe"" alternative for my children to eat -"	unverifiable
or allow them to bring safe food of their own on the plane with them.	unverifiable
i've never heard of anyone having a wheat allergy going into anaphylaxis from some one sitting next to them eating a sandwich.	unverifiable
people with food allergies have reactions when they injest food.	non-experiential
the issue with peanuts is that when 200 people open 200 little bags of nuts and all the dust goes poof!	unverifiable
there is enough peanut dust in the air for some one  to actually injest the allergen.	non-experiential
as for meds - everyone that has a true life threatening food allergy should be carrying their own epi-pens with them.	unverifiable
"i would like to mention though that on the last flight i was on with my children we payed quite a bit of money on a ""snack box"" that didn't have the ingredients labeled on the outside of the box, only to find that most of the food in the box was not safe for my kids to eat."	experiential
a list of ingredients should always be available to us before we have to pay for food.	unverifiable
in a perfect world they would sell the number of seats they have.	unverifiable
when in us airspace, dot rules should apply to all carriers, regardless of the number of aircraft seats or nationality.	unverifiable
without details regarding the methodology of this cost-benefit analysis, it is difficult to comment on the 'reasonableness' of what is proposed.	unverifiable
disclosure of fees to the consumer should not have a quantifiable cost.	unverifiable
i have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.	experiential
she is one of those few who react from dust, practically.	experiential
we made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.	experiential
the airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy	non-experiential
and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.	unverifiable
it would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the dot banned peanuts on all flights.	unverifiable
of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.	unverifiable
the dot would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.	unverifiable
cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list .	non-experiential
i almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security unless a complete and total ban was instituted .	unverifiable
that being said, i appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume	unverifiable
though i do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume.	non-experiential
perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded,	unverifiable
propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!	unverifiable
of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.	unverifiable
*  from empirical evidence, i believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.	non-experiential
my daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.	experiential
she touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.	experiential
it doesn't take much.	unverifiable
*  i feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.	unverifiable
however, i am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.	unverifiable
adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.	unverifiable
my allergic daughter would not consume them,	experiential
but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.	unverifiable
we will take care of her food.	experiential
we just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.	unverifiable
compensation must be in fiat currency.	unverifiable
few if any airlines offer peanuts anymore.	non-experiential
but peanuts are not the only allergen-	non-experiential
more people are allergic to pets than peanuts.	non-experiential
airlines should disclose potential allergens on a flight .	unverifiable
first, i congratulate and thank secretary lahood and dot for their efforts in improving customer protections for travelers.	unverifiable
airports and carriers should work together to develop tarmac contingency plans.	unverifiable
personally, i think 3 hours is too long to be held captive in a immobile plane.	unverifiable
two hours is much more reasonable.	unverifiable
i agree - it's be wise to disclose potential allergens.	unverifiable
i agree, r88c, there are more allergens than just peanuts	non-experiential
my family has a few beyond peanuts in our own list.	experiential
however, there's a difference between my cat allergy  and my daughter's peanut, tree nut and shellfish allergies - threat of anaphylaxis, vomiting, swelling of lips, itching in the mouth, etc.	non-experiential
any food allergen  can trigger life threatening reactions -	non-experiential
whole peanuts or nuts are also more apt to release dust particles through the air system, then, say, opening a milk carton.	non-experiential
no	unverifiable
but it is a start.	unverifiable
as a mother of a peanut allergic child,	experiential
i won't fly with her on flights that serve peanuts.	unverifiable
i won't fly with her if i can't have her epipen with her in flight.	unverifiable
consumers should be notified about delays, no matter how long they are.	unverifiable
this can be done electronically very easily.	unverifiable
if the flight is late and making a connecting flight is not possible, then the consumer should be afforded the opportunity to alter plans as soon as possible.	unverifiable
i think it is important that both domestic and international flights be covered by this requirement.	unverifiable
giving the consumer's more information regarding pricing schemes is definitely helpful for those who travel on a budget.	unverifiable
i think that post-purchase price increases should be banned.	unverifiable
if a compromise must be reached, then any consumer must be allowed to refund their ticket if prices are increased--even if the ticket was non-refundable.	unverifiable
trapping consumers like this is horrible and quite unethical.	unverifiable
airlines should absolutely reimburse passengers whose bags are not delivered on time or lost.	unverifiable
it cannot be left for the airlines to decide.	unverifiable
yes, carriers should refund ticket costs for significant delays.	unverifiable
actually, they should give consumers the choice between a refund or some other form of compensation for those travelers who decide their time has become too short for travel due to the delay and change their travel plans.	unverifiable
significant delay must also be defined by dot.	unverifiable
it's too bad that this industry has become so anti-consumerist.	unverifiable
self-regulation has not worked and the consumers have carried a significant burden because of it.	unverifiable
i don't know that i would feel safe flying without a total ban.	unverifiable
there are too many variables.	unverifiable
realistically, i know that a total ban is unlikely.	unverifiable
for most people, an airline ban, a buffer zone, epinephrine in a first aid kit, and pre-boarding would probably go a long way to making them comfortable.	unverifiable
i've also heard in the past of some airlines forcing passengers to sign statements acknowledging that they will not stop the flight and seek assistance if an allergic reaction happens.	unverifiable
i think it was american airlines and i read the actual documents.	experiential
obviously, this practice is incredibly paralyzing.	unverifiable
last i knew, medical emergencies in the form of heart attacks and pre-mature labor are handled on a case by case basis	non-experiential
and it is not unheard of to land a plane early.	non-experiential
aa made the allergic community an exception to this practice.	non-experiential
though our comfort zone is very tight,	unverifiable
i do appreciate that the dot is trying to reach a compromise with the allergic and non-allergic passengers.	unverifiable
for many people, minor changes to the system will go a long way.	unverifiable
i think red eye is correct:	unverifiable
dot is on a slippery slope if it bans peanuts.	unverifiable
"perhaps airlines could offer only select flights as ""peanut-free"" instead of a complete ban on peanuts."	unverifiable
i have to say i think this is going too far.	unverifiable
you can't legislate everything.	unverifiable
i have to say i've never seen such a thing on the news.	experiential
no perfume, because people are allergic to that.	unverifiable
no deodorant, because some are allergic to that.	unverifiable
oh, and make  sure you wear all cotton	unverifiable
because you might bump up against someone with a skin allergy to synthetic fiber.	non-experiential
it can quickly slide into ridiculous.	unverifiable
i'm sorry for those who have allergies,	unverifiable
but those people also live with them daily and know how to cope and deal with them in public.	unverifiable
all the baggage fee has done is force people to take more as carry-ons, causing loading delays of all sorts.	non-experiential
between the security  and the baggage fees pretty soon you won't be able to take anything with you at all.	unverifiable
the cost of the ticket is already ridiculously high.	unverifiable
instead of charging us, perhaps they need to bring in consultants and auditors to see just where their money is going	unverifiable
and see how they can be more efficient with the money they are already extorting.	unverifiable
i've actually found it's now cheaper to ship my items fed ex than it is to bring them with me on the plane.	non-experiential
and they get there! on time!	experiential
i totally agree if the airline loses the luggage or it's delayed they should have to refund the fee they charged.	unverifiable
they did not provide the service you paid for, end of story.	unverifiable
i completely agree all the fees should be listed when you buy that ticket.	unverifiable
prominently. you should know what you are going to be asked to pay for.	unverifiable
i have to say personally that if they start charging me a fee for putting a small bag in the overhead bin i will no longer be a customer.	unverifiable
i will not fly any airline that does something so ridiculous.	unverifiable
no, that's where i draw the line.	unverifiable
i'll drive	unverifiable
even 2 hrs is too much if weather is hot, small children are among passengers.	unverifiable
either get the plane in the air or take passengers off.	unverifiable
i do not have an allergy to peanuts	experiential
but i do to carmine coloring.	experiential
i have to watch what foods i eat and keep an epinephrine pen with me at all times.	experiential
i believe all people with allergies must follow this same rule.	unverifiable
if a person with very severe allergies boards a plane and allerts them ahead of time of their allergy, then keep the peanuts off the flight.	unverifiable
this would apply to all kinds of allergies.	non-experiential
as a flight attendant of 19and years, we never had peanut allergies in the earlier days,	experiential
people dealt with their own issues and got on with it.	unverifiable
"it seems like the latest ""illness"" fad that plagues this country far too often."	unverifiable
i utterly concur.	unverifiable
while i am sympathetic to those with this condition,	unverifiable
it is the total responsibility of the parent or adult to adequately prepare for the possibility of being exposed to an allergen.	unverifiable
airlines have enough to worry about without all of these over-the-top issues.	unverifiable
it's time for more personal responsibility and far less government nannying.	unverifiable
once purchased, ticket prices should be guaranteed.	unverifiable
i support the complete ban.	unverifiable
if the dot decides to have a looser standard, passengers should be allowed to get their money returned if they choose not to pay the post-purchase fee.	unverifiable
the 'peanut people' are not taking their business to southwest.	non-experiential
since your airline continues to serve peanuts,	non-experiential
so i'm sure no one has died	non-experiential
because they can't fly on your planes.	unverifiable
my child with a severe nut and peanut allergy had a reaction on a domestic flight.	experiential
luckily her breathing was not compromised	experiential
i was very very close to using epi-pens on this flight and had all the flight attendants hovering around us.	unverifiable
she only ate the safe food we brought onto the flight - nothing from the airline.	experiential
i also wiped down our seating area before she boarded.	experiential
however, she is very touch-sensitive	experiential
and the seats are hard to clean	unverifiable
as they are made of fabric.	non-experiential
for the flight home we brought a sheet to cover the seats	experiential
and she did not react the same way but did get a hive or two none-the-less.	unverifiable
peanut-residue is very hard to remove from fabric surfaces.	unverifiable
i would love to see a ban on having loose peanuts on flights -	unverifiable
food like snickers that contain nuts are ok from my perspective.	unverifiable
i agree with many others that even 3 hours is too long..	unverifiable
i think it should be 2 and should apply to all flights regardless of what airport, airline, destination, etc.	unverifiable
personally i have anxiety issues	unverifiable
and not being able to get out of an enclosed space is extremely stressful.	unverifiable
i think the airlines will now be forced to do all they can to prevent these delays.	unverifiable
even though all will not be possible to prevent	unverifiable
i think there will be much less episodes wtih these new rules.	unverifiable
as far as notification as to what is happening--i think it goes a long ways to alleviate frustration if we were informed in detail every 30 minutes.	unverifiable
i have been stranded on a plane 3 times--thankfully not more than 1 1 or 2 hours--	experiential
but on one of these flights we were informed regularly along the way	experiential
and it made all the difference.	unverifiable
list all fees seperately.	unverifiable
i agree--all fees should be prominently displayed wherever you are making the purchase.	unverifiable
i fly fairly often on a 2 hr flight to see family.	experiential
since the inception of baggage fees i do not check any bags--	experiential
i carry on a regulation carry-on for the bin and a fairly large purse bag that does fit comfortably under my seat.	experiential
i feel that as long as your carry-ons meet one regulation size in bin and one that fits comfortably under your seat that should be fine--	unverifiable
and the airlines need to describe what is allowed that way.	unverifiable
i am on a limited budget	experiential
and the $30-$60 fee for bags is better spent having fun with my grandson.	unverifiable
i think it has gotten to the point of ridiculous how these petty fees are charged for everything--	unverifiable
it certtainly does not give the customer a warm fuzzy feeling toward the industry.	unverifiable
everyone i know now hates to fly.	unverifiable
post fees for everything prominently.	unverifiable
should be required of all carriers.	unverifiable
i have found i am adequately notified before i leave home if a flight is known to be delayed or canceled that far in advance.	unverifiable
i check the flight status on the airline website just prior to leaving home--	experiential
additionally my airline sends me a text and an email for delays.	experiential
my concern is the flights that get delayed or cancelled later such as after you have arrived at the airport.	unverifiable
in these cases notification should be immediate--	unverifiable
my experience has been the airlines need to do all in their power to get you on your way in the most expedient way possible and to care.	unverifiable
but when a consumer misses an entire day of a vacation and or or planned time with family that cannot be given back!!	unverifiable
this is more than money.	unverifiable
twice my flights wer delayed by several hours	experiential
because after boarding it was discovered a lavatory was not in working order	experiential
i get passionate about not being treated well--especially when airline travel is expensive for most passengers.	unverifiable
make the compensation exactly what it is intended to be...the cost  of the ticket, no cap	unverifiable
since there is no cap on how much you may pay for that ticket.	non-experiential
frequent flyer miles should simply be refunded or a double amount refunded in the same way as a cash ticket is handled.	unverifiable
keep this simple and it will work much better.	unverifiable
on smaller flights, use the same rules.	unverifiable
again, keep it simple.	unverifiable
best way to give passengers information is to post it online, on a legible sign in the gate area, and in print large enough to read on tickets.	unverifiable
if people won't take the time to read at least one of those sources then they only have themselves to blame for not knowing about this.	unverifiable
a regulation that will force the air carriers to prominently display the various fees that are required is a good idea so that you know before you fly just how much more your ticket really is going to cost .	unverifiable
"optional price for a meal or entertainment is ""nice to know"" information"	unverifiable
but i don't think it needs to be written as a regulation	unverifiable
since you have the option of not watching a movie	non-experiential
but you likely don't have the option of not bringing that suitcase along.	non-experiential
the website notification is a good idea	unverifiable
but it would also be good to have these posted in the check-in area as well.	unverifiable
the idea of a full fair price with every optional cost added in is not realistic	unverifiable
since the majority of people do not use all of the options.	non-experiential
i do like the add-on services idea.	unverifiable
it's not the job of the airlines however to tell you that their competition may have a cheaper flight for you.	unverifiable
sorry, that's the consumer's job.	unverifiable
if one airline charges significantly more for something than another airline does and it affects the competitiveness of their tickets the market will deal with that,	unverifiable
no regulation for this is needed.	unverifiable
airlines should be required not only to notify passengers to changes in their itinerary, but to offer the passenger a chance to refuse the change being made and re-schedule the flight to meet their travel needs.	unverifiable
"it is absolutely unfair of the airline to mandate that i accept a change to my flight departure time that now conflicts with the purpose or timelines of my trip without offering me an option to say ""no thanks, i chose a 2 pm departure for a very specific reason, please offer me another option that doesn't disrupt my plans""."	unverifiable
"there should be no ""change fee"" charged to the consumer who turns down the airline's change to their itinerary and opts to re-book the flight."	unverifiable
way back in january i booked a flight to nc with very specific choices made to ensure that i had enough time between flights and that i arrived within a certain window of time.	unverifiable
the airline proceeded to change my itinerary on three separate occasions, ultimately putting me on the flights i had specifically avoided when i booked the ticket.	unverifiable
"when i called to ask if i could re-book to meet my travel needs, i was told that the airline would charge me a change fee of ""at least"" $180, plus the difference in ticket price on that day."	unverifiable
this is absurd.	unverifiable
no, no, no! if you have an allergy to peanuts and you know you have it then take your own precautions.	unverifiable
"if i decide to bring a bag of peanuts onboard an airplane and am then told i'm in a ""peanut free zone"" or something like that, then my rights have been trampled as have the rights of everyone in that zone."	unverifiable
request peanut free services from the airlines for yourself,	unverifiable
but do not force those restrictions on the rest of the flying public.	unverifiable
i have no problem with the airline offering peanut free foods, etc.	unverifiable
"it is not a ""right"" if you have to impose that behavior on others for yourself."	unverifiable
there is a non-profit organization called the food allergy network	non-experiential
their web site is foodallergy.org.	non-experiential
my son now ten years old has a very severe peanut allergy.	experiential
some of the things most kids take for granted are not available to him due to the allergy.	experiential
he cannot go to a professional baseball game for one.	experiential
we also have to plan our vacations the locations that peanut free airlines to.	unverifiable
"the common misconception is ""just don't eat peanuts!"""	unverifiable
it would be nice if it were that simple.	unverifiable
the confined space and recycling of the air in a plane is a peanut allergy sufferers nightmare.	unverifiable
when people eat peanuts or open up bags of preanuts some of the allergens are released into the air.	non-experiential
therefore the allergic person can be affected without physically eating the peanuts.	non-experiential
the air becomes toxic to them.	non-experiential
for my son this is a not just discomfort it could kill him.	experiential
to clarify, the best action, in my opinion, for the dot to take in regards to this matter is to completely ban post-purchase price increases	unverifiable
peanut dust can trigger allergic reactions.	non-experiential
three hours is too long to wait on the tarmac.	unverifiable
the rules should be uniform regarless of the size of the plan or airport.	unverifiable
after an hour or so, sitting in a plane becomes unbearable.	unverifiable
the maximum time allowed should be two hours with deplaning an option.	unverifiable
boarding passes can be re-used or re-issued for access  back onto the plan.	unverifiable
the proposed compensation for bumping should be such, that ailine companies would be motivated to keep on average 1 to 2 seats on any flight unoccupied - for other bumped passengers or emergency personnel to use.	unverifiable
the compensation should, however, at least cover all consequential expences of the traveller besides fare.	unverifiable
this way, a passenger will have maximum compensation that would still allow airline not raise fares because of this rule.	unverifiable
2. the compensation should not depend on the plane size.	unverifiable
3. the compensation should be the same for all tickets, zero fare or not.	unverifiable
4. all compensation options, as well as compensation amounts, should be announced to passengers when asking for volunteers.	unverifiable
yes, 30 min delay is a reasonable trigger.	unverifiable
yes, 30 min response time limit is reasonable,	unverifiable
but special circumstances should be included, i.e., technical issues as breakdown of comms etc.	unverifiable
"dot should mention ""all available methods"" - that is okay."	unverifiable
this rule should apply to all domestic airlines;	unverifiable
foreing might be excluded.	unverifiable
yes to one way fare proposal!	unverifiable
no, no wiggle room:	unverifiable
all fare prices should be as stated and final!	unverifiable
all this caveats are just indended to provide sellers with means to mislead customers into thinking the fare could be smaller than it is!	unverifiable
yes, ticket sellers will incur costs to adjust the websites and selling practices;	non-experiential
however, these are the costs they incurred for unfair advertizing at the moment they created their current web sites and other means of semi-deceptive sales!	unverifiable
sum of all fees should always be listed - max and min amounts, with ability to get to all separate fees if desired.	unverifiable
full fare price should not include fees for traditionally provided services,	unverifiable
but fee range for them should be indicated.	unverifiable
the rules should apply to all us carriers regardless of size.	unverifiable
the baggage fee for a flight should be set to the smallest one between code-sharing partners.	unverifiable
offering lowest fare available - reservations software are not all written the same.	unverifiable
convoluted solutions on unusual but valid routings exist but often defy being found.	unverifiable
as a matter of practice, with availability changing constantly, it would be a near impossibility to enforce this unless software is rewritten in a consistent manner,	unverifiable
plus it would have to track complete historical availability at each instant in order to enforce the rule.	unverifiable
the intent is great,	unverifiable
but i think unattainable and unenforceable.	unverifiable
i think 3 hours is an absolute maximum that should be enforced on all planes regardless of size or airport.	unverifiable
and that is only when restrooms and water are provided.	unverifiable
if the delay is longer than the originally scheduled flight , there should be a mechanism for obtaining food as well.	unverifiable
with the state of meals and snacks on-board planes these days , i've been stuck in-flight with no food for many hours.	experiential
if on the ground, it makes no sense to not at least have some snack.	unverifiable
full price with breakout of optional items should always be with the price - online, at ticket agents, etc.	unverifiable
code-share arrangements should be the same as those of the airline issuing the ticket.	unverifiable
i think that 3 months is not long enough for many infrequent travelers.	unverifiable
but if the optional  items are clearly listed upon ticket reservation or purchase, that should suffice.	unverifiable
i think that separate charges for choosing your seat, having one carry on and one checked bag and access to water and restroom are nuts and should not happen.	unverifiable
snacks, blankets, ok, although these days we all look like campers getting on with pillows, extra jackets, meals , and as much carry-on as will fit.	unverifiable
counterproductive!	unverifiable
amen, this proposal goes too far.	unverifiable
freedom loving travelers don't want to be told what they can and can't bring on board the aircraft to eat.	unverifiable
i know i would ignore any such ban as i currently regularly bring peanuts aboard any aircraft i am flying.	unverifiable
"it has become abundantly clear that commercial airline travel is a ""race to the bottom"" that satisfies needs of neither passengers nor airline profits."	unverifiable
a change of environment, which can only be imposed from outside the industry is needed.	unverifiable
imposition of common sense regulations, such as a requirement that airlines give updated flight information, would level the playing field and remove the impetus for airlines to cost-cut in this area.	unverifiable
this goes for most of the proposed new regulations.	unverifiable
i sincerely believe that these regulations are in the best interests of both airlines and passengers.	unverifiable
i am generally against government interference in business activity,	unverifiable
but this is an instance where the government must step in.	unverifiable
charging fees for carry-on luggage is an example.	unverifiable
the airlines have created a scenario for this to happen.	non-experiential
they started by charging fees for checked luggage with little outcry.	unverifiable
they knew by doing this they would create problems with carry-on luggage.	unverifiable
once the travelling public accepted the fact of checked luggage fees,the airlines could complain about the amount of luggage brought into the cabin.	unverifiable
so we hear about sore backs from flight attendants, cramped space, etc.	unverifiable
all of this a result of the airlines change in fees.	unverifiable
now the airlines want to explore charging for carry-on luggage.	unverifiable
before this becomes viral, even with promises by most airlines at this time not to charge for carry-on's, the government needs to explore preventing this from ever happening.	unverifiable
i beleive it is part of the airlines overall plan to get to the point of charging for carry-on luggage,by highlighting the problems it created in the first place.	non-experiential
i agree that the dot's latest changes are needed,	unverifiable
but we should try to prevent abusive practices from ever getting  traction in the first place.	unverifiable
the airline industry in this country has shown they cannot regulate themselves.	unverifiable
i generally support the idea,	unverifiable
but it should be limited only to those fees which are variable, ie charge for food, etc.	unverifiable
they should not be allowed to list fees separately that are part of a ticket fee for every ticket issued, ie taxes, landing fees.	unverifiable
this process serves no purpose other than to show a lower base fee.	unverifiable
that is misleading and meaningless.	unverifiable
if they want to show these components of a ticket, so be it, but not to suggest a price which could never be exercised.	unverifiable
i had no idea that peanut allergies can be so severe that proximity was enough to trigger a reaction.	unverifiable
while i sympathize with the situation,	unverifiable
"with the advent of ""food-for-purchase"" on airplanes, more and more passengers bring their own food."	non-experiential
not serving peanut products won't completely protect those who are violently allergic because of what other passengers bring on board.	unverifiable
the only way i can see to ban peanuts altogether is a tsa regulation to ban it on top of an airline ban for their food service.	unverifiable
this increases costs of screening and imposes new regulations on all passengers and, in turn, increases the cost of airline tickets, not to mention slowing the tsa screening lines due to increased security to check food products.	unverifiable
but, finding a practical solution will be much harder than may first appear.	unverifiable
i know this sounds silly,	unverifiable
but i think i shouldn't be charged as much to check a bag as the 250-lb man sitting next to me.	unverifiable
i don't mind getting weighed in public...	unverifiable
i don't know.	unverifiable
this is just something that seems unfair to lots of passengers,	unverifiable
and that probably won't get changed without regulation.	unverifiable
i'm a freedom-loving, peanut-friendly traveler,	unverifiable
and i have no problem with the government protecting other people from dangerous activity.	unverifiable
that's the government's job.	non-experiential
i agree with all the proposals.	unverifiable
but with the smaller regional jets and small number of flights out of my hometown airport, bumping may not allow me to get to my destination the same day or even the next day.	unverifiable
there are additional considerations here, loss of vacation time as well as paying for hotel rooms not used and rental car days.	unverifiable
any thought about how we might get away from these charges.	unverifiable
just read about a buffer zone, and the lavitories, good point,	unverifiable
i also, know if flight attendants eat these items with there hands it still would create a problem	non-experiential
also, that is why no one has wanted to address this,	unverifiable
that is why it is important that it is.	unverifiable
how do you stop people from breing it one, and such that is ahard issue	unverifiable
i fly internationally frequently	experiential
and so i fly through major airports in the us.	experiential
these airports have maybe 60 planes taking off an hour--and landing.	non-experiential
just an incredible number.	unverifiable
practically speaking, the airports must have extra gates available for flights that become delayed for unloading passengers.	unverifiable
this could be done by either limiting the number of planes that take-off or land at the airport or providing contingent and safe ways to unload passengers--and provide them with adequate holding areas for these passengers.	unverifiable
if airports share in the responsibility, they are more likely to work together with the airlines to provide such a service.	unverifiable
i also think that the information about tarmac delays at individual airports  should be provided to the consumer.	unverifiable
i know there are some statistics already provided,	non-experiential
but i don't recall seeing any statistics on this recently.	experiential
as a very frequent traveler,	experiential
beyond that i believe that adding all of these unnecessary burdens to airlines often of which they have no control such as weather and unexpected mechanical problems is both costly and ridiculous.	unverifiable
you would think that with the economic turndown, our society would abate their temper tantrams and demanding attitudes.	unverifiable
let's be civil to one another and not set unrealistic expectations--	unverifiable
it costs money to accommodate your pampering and often results in unintended consequences such as the recent 3 hour tarmac limit.	unverifiable
this will result in more flight cancellations.	unverifiable
i wonder how many of you who complained about that and now have gotten what you asked for, will see yourselves as the cause of this ludicrous rule.	unverifiable
well said.	unverifiable
i fly extensively in the us and internationally.	experiential
and, in reading all the comments posted thus far, for the most part, there appears to be a lot of emotion and not a lot of facts surrounding this issue.	unverifiable
the airlines should not be banning any food	unverifiable
and they certainly should not be come the food police.	unverifiable
i strongly urge the dot to get more scientic-based information.	unverifiable
however, i want to point out that when we installed ramps for those in a wheel chairs, we did not remove the stairs.	experiential
some facts to consider.	unverifiable
studies show that you cannot have a serious or deadly reaction to peanut, tree nut,  or other food allergy protein by smelling it; despite what some of the contributors here have said.	non-experiential
"less than 1% of the population has a peanut allergy and not all of those are ""severly"" allergic."	non-experiential
compare that with the exponentially higher incidence of diabetes--	unverifiable
diabetics need plant based proteins like peanuts during flights to keep their blood sugar levels under control.	non-experiential
or, a milk allergy which is far more prevelent.	non-experiential
airborne exposure will not affect the body systemically, so therefore cannot cause anaphylaxis.	non-experiential
if extremely allergic, you may have some symptoms like sneezing, running nose and coughing.	non-experiential
for those peanut or tree nut allergic, and for all food allergies, you must ingest the food protein to have a systemtic reaction.	non-experiential
and, even with direct skin contact to tree nuts, peanuts or peanut and nut butters, most allergic people will not show signs of a reaction,	non-experiential
or it so it will be a localized minor one such as hives, or a welt.	non-experiential
you can, however, have a psyhcosomatic reaction to anything you are afraid of.	non-experiential
peanut allergy has become an exaggerated fear to the detriment of those who suffer from other food allergies and other serious and chronic diseases.	unverifiable
more than 3,000 kids die from asthma each year;	non-experiential
10,000 kids go to the hospital each year with brain injuries due to sports;	non-experiential
45,000 kids die in car accidents.	non-experiential
last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities	experiential
it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods.	non-experiential
this is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies, or any allergy is not serious.	unverifiable
they are.	unverifiable
but i wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs, or if their children are being kept out of sports. or, have they given up driving their children in a car; or, will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16.	unverifiable
i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk	unverifiable
because people think milk allergy can't be fatal;	non-experiential
they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance	unverifiable
because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues.	unverifiable
a recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do.	non-experiential
again, i am not minimizing those who do,	unverifiable
but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge.	unverifiable
then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to.	unverifiable
and, a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity.	unverifiable
many people have multiple food allergies,	unverifiable
but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions.	unverifiable
so, let's rid ourselves of the hysteria.	unverifiable
let's stop our demanding and outrageousness	unverifiable
and let's call for ome common sense.	unverifiable
"i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the ""bogey man""."	unverifiable
instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner--whether it's severe asthma, other food allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday.	unverifiable
i myself have a food allergy	experiential
so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant;	unverifiable
it isn't easy.	unverifiable
in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on, i find that whether in the us or abroad, without legislation, they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely.	unverifiable
we have more than enough regulation	unverifiable
remember, you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal.	non-experiential
or, will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier, check on your medications, where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions.	unverifiable
my own near fatal experience to a different allergy reinforced for me that if you demand the world conform to you, you will become lax making it more likely you will have an accidenta encounter.	unverifiable
we need to be prepared and proactive, not create a bubble around ourselves and our children.	unverifiable
as a frequent traveler, i would welcome the rule requiring 24 hour refundability of fares and all fees.	unverifiable
additionally, there should be a certain window, say, 3 days prior to flying where you should be able to cancel your flight without penalty and receive a refund or at least the ability to change your itinerary without fee.	unverifiable
as i always say to all who will listen, the airline model is one of the worst business models i know of: treat your customers with disdain and make it as inconvenient as possible for them to use your product.	unverifiable
whether it be added fees to check luggage ;	unverifiable
making it too costly to change your itinerary;	unverifiable
making it virtually impossible to easily use frequent flyer miles or charging an exorbitant amount to actually use them;	unverifiable
and lastly, being treated like cattle at the airport and on the plane.	unverifiable
and while i always carry multiple epi-pens,	experiential
i only forty minutes to get to a hospital after using them.	non-experiential
i personally would like to see a ban on peanuts and enforcing passengers to refrain from bringing banned items on board.	unverifiable
but as another person pointed out, a lot of people are severely allergic to perfumes.	non-experiential
i think the dot should ask allergists the most common causes of allergic anaphylaxis, and include those in the ban.	unverifiable
after all, no one needs to wear perfumes or eat nuts.	unverifiable
another option i support is having no food or snacks on domestic flights.	unverifiable
while my daughter does not have an inhalation allergy,	experiential
she is extremely sensitive	unverifiable
and if she ingested even a minute particle of peanut protein, she could have a life threatening reaction.	unverifiable
while we have epi pens and benadryl to administer in the event of such an event,	non-experiential
those medications are only a short term response and immediate medical care is essential.	unverifiable
as a parent, it is my job to insure she does not ingest anything that will cause a reaction	unverifiable
and we do everything we can to create a large buffer between her and such products.	unverifiable
that said, we have little control over the environment in an airplane.	unverifiable
others eating peanuts nearby or even someone having eaten a peanut on an earlier flight could create a very real problem.	unverifiable
while we can do everything possible to clean the area in which we sit and diligently parent her while on the flight,	unverifiable
the risk is significant.	unverifiable
the simple fact is that a peanut allergy is life threatening and should not be compared to other intolerances or allergies that are not.	unverifiable
doing so is naive and bordering on ignorant.	unverifiable
balancing both the seriousness and scope of the threat involved against what could only be described as a petty inconvenince associated with banning peanuts and peanut products, the choice seems clear.	unverifiable
that is, unless the peanut lobby or ill-informed airline passengers are making decisions in washington.	unverifiable
"you should be able to purchace a ""ticket"" for these optional services at the time of ticket purchace."	unverifiable
"if you know you will be checking in one bag, and having a meal, you should be able to easily purchace a ""checked bag ticket"" and a ""meal ticket"" along with the flight ticket."	unverifiable
these optional tickets would be required to be honored by all airlines under all circumstances.	unverifiable
travel providers should be required to display the *entire* ticket price in their advertising.	unverifiable
they should not be allowed to raise the overall price with taxes, fees, etc.	unverifiable
"travel providers should absolutely not be allowed to advertise a ""one-way"" price when a round-trip purchase is required."	unverifiable
that's like a store advertising the price of one sneaker!	unverifiable
well, obviously you have to buy two sneakers	non-experiential
so why would a store advertise the price for just one.	unverifiable
likewise, travel providers should clearly display the round-trip cost if a round-trip purchase is required to obtain that fare.	unverifiable
i would like to see the dot consider regulations regarding carry-on bags in the near future.	unverifiable
i don't check luggage	experiential
so i would be against ticket prices being raised to cover one checked bag	unverifiable
although i think the airlines should allow it.	unverifiable
i travel with a single, legal-size backpack	experiential
and i dread the day i have to check it because others, rather than checking oversize bags decide to carry them on and they are not stopped at either security or the gate.	unverifiable
the european and asian airlines alreasy have fairly strict rules regarding carry-on luggage,	non-experiential
i'd like to see the dot consider something similar.	unverifiable
while i realize that peanut allergies can be severe,	unverifiable
i'm allergic to pet dander	experiential
and unfortunately every major airline now allows animals in the cabin -	unverifiable
while i understand the necessity of service animals,	unverifiable
i've also seen animals snuck aboard or allowed out of our cages.	experiential
i'm also allergic to large amounts of perfume or scent -	unverifiable
i've broken out in hives after one occasion and had no real recourse.	experiential
the rules definitely need to be spelled out as specifically as possible and should apply to all airlines -	unverifiable
i don't trust the airlines to develop and enforce their own policy.	unverifiable
i agree with you vec.	unverifiable
i am severely allergic to cats	experiential
which leads to many of the same symptoms that people with peanut allergies have tightness in the chest, the feeling of their throat closing	experiential
for me these symptoms are made more severe	experiential
because i also have asthma, which kicks in when i am around cats - airway constriction, uncontrollable coughing etc.	experiential
from reading some of the post i understand that the argument has been made that peanuts should be banned because people can die of a peanut allergy.	non-experiential
i also believe that animals should also be banned then	unverifiable
because people who are allergic and or have asthma could also die if they are on an extended flight with an animal they are allergic to.	non-experiential
previous experience with getting bumped off a flight  and the airline refused to put me on another carrier's flight -	experiential
instead i had a flight that was six hours later with absolutely no compensation.	experiential
"basically the customer servie rep's attitude was ""it's not my problem and you're using miles so we owe you nothing."""	unverifiable
i'm not sure how i feel about a carry-on fee.	unverifiable
i would prefer to support allowing a single carry-on bag of a reasonable size  before a fee is added not counting coats, baby bags or medical eqpt -	unverifiable
unfortunately i've seen purses and laptop cases that are almsot luggage sized.	experiential
restictions need to be enforced at check-in, near security, and at the gate.	unverifiable
i thought the faa had mandated what was allowable,	non-experiential
but i have seen people allowed on with more than the 1and1 or clearly oversized bags.	unverifiable
current fees should clearly be listed on the front page of the airline's website, on itineraries printed out, and on boarding passes - especially when people check in online.	unverifiable
in the interest of full disclosure, i am an allergy sufferer, mom to a child with multiple life threatening food allergies  and founder of bestallergysites.com.	experiential
i don't know that anyone  can say with 100% confidence whether someone might have a reaction from peanut dust.	unverifiable
all individuals and allergies are different.	unverifiable
an allergic reaction is an immune system response.	non-experiential
if an individuals immune system is compromised, they might have a more severe reaction then they would have otherwise.	non-experiential
"there ""have"" been reactions in situations where a person is exposed to a large amount of airborne peanut protein when multiple bags of peanuts are opened at once. for instance: at a ball park."	non-experiential
i only imagine a plane would be worse.	unverifiable
my son had what we consider an anaphylactic reaction in flight at around the age of 2 from picking up his toy on the plane floor and then rubbing his eyes.	experiential
his eyes immediately swelled,	experiential
he started coughing and crying.	experiential
hives developed and so on.	experiential
we can only guess that there was peanut dust on the floor.	experiential
all allergic passengers should have or carry and be able to carry on board--epinephrine .	unverifiable
planes should also have them on flight due to reactions where 1. someone doesn't have theirs 2. first time reaction in someone who didn't know they were allergic.	unverifiable
an epipen is not enough however.	unverifiable
allergic reactions can and may come back	non-experiential
some may need iv treatment or other medications.	non-experiential
in my opinion, all obvious peanut containing foods should be restricted--peanuts, peanut butter, peanut cookies, etc.	unverifiable
the other products are not necessarily a concern from a dust standpoint but from a contact standpoint.	unverifiable
some individuals are allergic by touching a surface with peanut protein and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.	non-experiential
most kids do this and even adults rub their eyes.	unverifiable
"peanut oil is ""usually"" so highly processed that no peanut protein remains--"	non-experiential
so that might not be an issue.	unverifiable
obviously there are always exceptions to the rule.	non-experiential
"items labeled ""may contain peanuts"" or ""processed in a facility w or  peanuts"" would more than likely be too difficult to ban."	unverifiable
i think the biggest issues are 1. peanut protein in dust from opening bags of peanuts.	unverifiable
examples are trays, floors, arm rests windows, etc.	unverifiable
solutions-a.thorough cleanings between flights of all surfaces, b. banning all peanut containing products, c. adding a peanut buffer zone--	unverifiable
but it must be peanut safe or free 100% of the time or completely cleaned.	unverifiable
honestly--bottom line is going 100% peanut free or safe is the easiest and safest solution for all.	unverifiable
there are a million other foods and snacks to eat.	non-experiential
these allergies can be severe and life threatening.	non-experiential
"the only instance where i can personally see a potential actual ""need"" for peanut or peanut butter is in the rare case that it is a ""medical need"" for a passenger due to their diet or a disability."	unverifiable
in that case--i think there should be accommodations put in place for those passengers.	unverifiable
"i'm completely aware of the strong feelings and opinions a ""ban"" brings forth."	unverifiable
having a child and having seen a child suffer a life threatening reaction is not something i wish on anyone.	unverifiable
experiencing that in mid air with no access to an ambulance, er or dr. is beyond words.	unverifiable
while peanut allergies and reactions are not necessarily common--	unverifiable
they are by all means not uncommon and certainly not rare.	non-experiential
we live in a society	unverifiable
and as a society we often have to make accommodations for each other.	unverifiable
we always carry a doctors note with us stating that our son needs his epipen.	experiential
we've never been asked for the note and our epipens have never been taken, mentioned, or checked.	experiential
we fly out of logan boston and manchester nh.	experiential
we've never flown with epipens out of country.	experiential
i don't consider the needle to be that large.	unverifiable
i guess it depends upon your definition of large.	unverifiable
it's certainly not long.	unverifiable
but i guess anything is possible if the person knows how to use it in such a way.	unverifiable
i can't even imagine what that would be.	unverifiable
i do not think there should be a compensation cap.	unverifiable
if a passenger is bumped from a flight and misses an important business meeting, high school graduation or wedding, there is no price that can compensate for that.	unverifiable
certainly not $1300.	unverifiable
if a passenger can prove that he or she has additional expense above and beyond what the airline offers and the government requires he or she should be awarded more compensation.	unverifiable
as for zero-fare tickets, for the same reasons above, i do not think compensating them with just miles is adequate.	unverifiable
i was especially happy to do so when a group of 50and school students needed to get onboard together to fly from london to dallas but the airline messed up.	unverifiable
volunteer opportunities and compensation should be posted or announced when one checks in  and continue to be posted and announced for all to see or hear until the last minute and the airline has to bump involuntarily.	unverifiable
any and all fees potentially associated with a fare should be disclosed in full, in a clear and concise manner.	unverifiable
the astronomical airport taxes levied at some international destinations spring immediately to mind as one charge that is mandatory for all fares, fixed, and something that will not vary if a consumer goes to shop with another airline.	unverifiable
as far as post-purchase price changes go, they should be considered fraudulent.	unverifiable
it would be one thing if the airlines automatically refunded you money when they re-price a flight below the price you paid at time of purchase,	unverifiable
because the potential for price changes would then at least go both ways.	unverifiable
but since no airline, as far as i know, offers anything like a pre-order guarantee,	unverifiable
the price paid at the time of purchase needs to be the last word in what the flight costs.	unverifiable
barring any on-site add-ons like the customer bringing a heavy bag, or deciding to purchase an alcoholic beverage.	unverifiable
no, no, no, no, no to a less-than-complete ban.	unverifiable
if it's not an outright ban, the airlines, hotels, and tour operators will quickly concoct schemes to give themselves the right to do whatever they want to their prices after the fact.	unverifiable
i feel for people with severe peanut allergies ;	unverifiable
it must be terrible trying to avoid such a prevalent product.	unverifiable
"i don't see how creating a peanut-free ""buffer zone"" around pre-registered allergic flyers is going to be genuinely effective in planes due to the recirculating air, and seems likely to cause conflict between airline employees and the non-allergic passengers being affected."	unverifiable
that would likely also have to be coupled with a ban on the sale of peanut-containing products in airports.	unverifiable
if we're addressing hazards to the health of passengers from products that the affected passengers themselves aren't even consuming, peanut allergies are not the only allergy or immune system problem that affects the flying public on a daily basis.	non-experiential
those types of rules seem like the logical follow-up to rules surrounding peanut allergies.	unverifiable
i am a little skeptical that dot has the power to implement this peanut ban.	unverifiable
i would think that since congress took away funding the last time that dot tried to get rid of peanuts and dot implicitly agreed to not take away peanuts, that dot could not implement a peanut ban without congress' express authorization.	non-experiential
it would seem to me that dot is playing a little fast and loose with the idea that just because congress hasnt put the ban in place again, it must not want the ban.	unverifiable
also, the notice talks about congress requiring a peer reviewed study about the effects of peanuts on planes.	unverifiable
if so, why is it not included in the notice.	unverifiable
i am not saying that the peanut ban is bad,	unverifiable
but there are rules	non-experiential
and it doesnt appear that dot is playing by them.	non-experiential
that's ridiculous.	unverifiable
i agree that there needs to be some compensation for those who use miles.	unverifiable
also, airlines' refusal to put people on other airlines' flights has long annoyed me.	unverifiable
i feel all airlines should be required to include one free checked bag up to 50 pounds per person per ticket.	unverifiable
"airplanes, in general, are not ""commuter"" vehicles to go get a coffee or go to work for the day."	unverifiable
most people are going somewhere at least overnight and obviously can not bring their car with them on the plane!	unverifiable
"the fees for checked bags encourage people to carry more on which increases the risk of something ""harmful"" slipping onto the plane."	unverifiable
one free checked bag of 50 pounds or less is not unreasonable.	unverifiable
there should be no discrimination in how a passenger is bumped or compensated just because they may have paid less for a ticket or used frequent flyer miles.	unverifiable
airline tickets are not lottery tickets.	non-experiential
one does not purchase a ticket hoping to reach a certain destination.	unverifiable
same as if one pays $4 for a cup of coffee or $1, the cup is supposed to have coffee in it.	unverifiable
"the price does not dictate that ""maybe"" you will get the product or service."	unverifiable
also, the airline decides what prices or miles are used to purchase a promise to get you from point a to point b.	non-experiential
if they can not afford to give  a ticket for that price, they should not sell it.	unverifiable
when you reserve a ticket, the assumption is that you will be taken from point a to point b by the times given by the airline.	unverifiable
a passenger does not purchase a ticket just to see if maybe they can get somewhere because they have nothing better to do.	unverifiable
if compensation is not high enough, the airlines will not have an incentive to schedule properly.	unverifiable
"it is not fair to allow airlines to discriminate against lower fared passengers or ""free"" passengers"	unverifiable
since it is the airline, not the passenger or government, who gave that passenger a seat.	non-experiential
"otherwise, airlines can advertise low fares or con you into using them to build up your ""miles"" and then always bump you for someone who paid more."	non-experiential
in away,it is the same as being able to increase your ticket price anytime after purchase.	unverifiable
when you are bumped, there are a lot of hidden extra costs .	non-experiential
it irks me that airlines seem to be treating passengers more and more as if they have nothing better to do but wait around in airports and not get to where the airline promised to bring them.	unverifiable
again, the airline sets the agreed price or miles for a seat, no one else.	non-experiential
the incentives to the airline should be to get all confirmed passengers  to the destination promised.	unverifiable
as i read through all the comments opposed to the peanut ban, i am amazed as to why some people feel it's more important to fight for the right to consume the snack of their choice, over the chance to help protect the life of another human being.	unverifiable
it is a fact that peanuts do kill people.	non-experiential
yes, it is a small percentage of the current population -	non-experiential
and keep in mind, peanut allergies have doubled over the last five years.	non-experiential
so perhaps it will not be such a small percentage soon.	unverifiable
i think it is a sad statement on our society that this even is a debatable issue.	unverifiable
i would support a complete ban of peanuts and peanut products on aircraft carriers, as they are a confined, temporary space with no access to emergency medical assistance.	unverifiable
airplanes are different than airports, restaurants, taxis and other places that people have mentioned where a ban would not be necessary.	unverifiable
in the future, i would also support a ban of any substance proven to cause death ...	unverifiable
peanuts are not the only food.	non-experiential
tree nuts and shellfish can be just as deadly.	non-experiential
it will not kill anyone to not eat peanuts during the course of one flight.	non-experiential
i will kill someone with food allergies if they accidentally do.	non-experiential
on a very recent trip for a 3-week stay the outbound trip was marred by the airline losing the bag for nearly three days.	experiential
the bag was damaged beyond repair	experiential
the pull out handle was broken off -	experiential
airline says it isn't covered.	experiential
i had no vehicle to take the bag to their claim office - a 140 mile round trip in the state with the most expensive gasoline.	experiential
i made a specific request that at a minimum my bag fee be refunded	experiential
since i had to do without my belongings for almost three days.	experiential
they flatly refused.	experiential
i support a rule which would force a refund of any bag fee in the case of damage or delay.	unverifiable
on a shorter trip i had only a carry-on which heeds the airline size limits.	experiential
however, i was seated near the front and apparently people seated in the rear left their bags near the front.	experiential
there were no forward spaces remaining when my group boarded.	experiential
i don't know what might be the solution to that.	unverifiable
as the mother of a severe peanut allergic child who has had an episode on an airplane that required epinephrine i would like to stress how important it is to remove all peanuts and peanut products from the plane.	unverifiable
even traces of peanut butter left on the tray table can pose a threat to someone with a severe peanut allergy.	non-experiential
it is also important for crew to alert passengers through a public announcement and ask them not to eat peanuts that they have brought on board.	unverifiable
this is becoming more common as airlines cut down on food service.	non-experiential
america airlines are the worst in assisting passengers with peanut allergies.	unverifiable
airlines need to do what most schools today do:	unverifiable
ban all peanut products	unverifiable
and ban people from bringing peanuts and peanut products onto the plane.	unverifiable
flying is not a choice,	unverifiable
it is often a necessity.	unverifiable
it is hard to believe that this issue is even up for debate.	unverifiable
if you take your daughter on a flight knowing that they serve peanuts, and knowing that her reactions are so severe, then you have created the problem, and that emergency landing should come out of your pocketbook.	unverifiable
consider that before you infringe upon the rights of hundreds of others to cater to your needs.	unverifiable
carry an epi pen or use alternate transportation rather than expecting the world to bow to your needs.	unverifiable
it's simply not realistic.	unverifiable
how about people with gluten allergies...	unverifiable
it's not a disability issue like a person that needs a ramp for a wheelchair,	unverifiable
it's a common sense issue that requires the person with the disability to prepare for the isolated emergency by taking proper steps like an epi pen, or an allergy tablet, the same as they would anywhere else, rather than expecting a controlling governmental agency to impose more bans that in effect infringe upon the rights of far more people...	unverifiable
things have gotten far out of control.	unverifiable
i know two people exactly like this that have been able to work the system well enough to get such placards when they don't deserve or require them,	non-experiential
they're in fact lazy.	unverifiable
at some point, this nonsense has to stop.	unverifiable
i've long believed that airlines purposely don't announce delays because of the consequences of doing so.	unverifiable
if a flight is delayed due to weather the airline has no obligation to provide any remedy to the affected passengers.	non-experiential
whereas a delay due to a mechanical problem may require compensation or accommodation be made.	non-experiential
i support an outright ban.	unverifiable
first, simply as a peanut allergy sufferer, a key travel worry of mine would be allayed.	unverifiable
second, either the creation of a buffer-zone or removal of peanuts base on a passenger's request is impractical.	unverifiable
finding appropriate seat arrangements for everyone is completely impractical and time-consuming, delaying take-off.	unverifiable
it also distracts flight attendants from completing their job.	unverifiable
second, among all of the other things a passenger needs to be keep in mind when traveling, notifying the airline of a peanut allergy should not be one of them.	unverifiable
one possible solution is to have a little box checked off when booking a ticket to indicate a peanut allergy.	unverifiable
but given the myriad of ways in which tickets are booked and purchased today, this is unlikely to be completely successful.	unverifiable
the most practical solution is to just ban them on flights.	unverifiable
the decision is not based on the risk to allergy and non-allergy passengers, but the costs of different solutions.	unverifiable
it seems that so many people on this forum want perfect, cushy, super-convenient, and inexpensive airline travel.	unverifiable
unfortunately, that is impossible.	unverifiable
also, since people are human,	non-experiential
there will be errors made by airline personnel.	unverifiable
some of these comments just sound like people want to do what they want  but yet get 100% of their fare refunded regardless if the airline is able to sell that seat or not.	unverifiable
"in other words, it sounds like ""to hell with the airlines""."	unverifiable
remember, the more regulations government puts on companies, the more prices go up.	unverifiable
the dot is just recognizing a product that is being provided by companies that pose a serious threat to a fairly large number of people.	unverifiable
most other products aboard flights are considered non-allergenic or do not have particulates that become airborne	non-experiential
which is the case with the bagged peanuts.	non-experiential
also, finding another mode of transportation is not an option for me as i might be the captain on your flight one day.	unverifiable
i would think that suggestion is not realistic.	unverifiable
"i understand that for those who do not have that or an allergy it might seem ""overblown"""	unverifiable
but i can assure you that overall, it is not.	unverifiable
it is simply a desire to eliminate a  1 food allergy product that can become airborne in a small, pressurized aluminum  tube.	unverifiable
yes, perfumes and many other products are allergens, most would be classified as irritants and are not life threatening.	non-experiential
peanuts are in a unique class of allergen that is quite widespread among the general population that has airborne particulate and that can be life threatening.	non-experiential
this is about documents risk mitigation for a voluntary product provided by a company.	unverifiable
you articulated that very, very well.	unverifiable
welcome to my world as a severe peanut allergy sufferer and airline captain.	unverifiable
i have been dealing with this for over 22 years!	experiential
i am yearning for the day  that i do not have to tell, an incredulous, flight attendant that i need a peanut free zone if i have to travel in the cabin!	unverifiable
the problem has increased over the years with the advent of more efficient turbofan engines.	non-experiential
it was found that excessive bleed air extraction from the engines  consumes more fuel than recirculating the air.	non-experiential
"unlike the ""coal burners"" of the past, modern jets recirculate much more of the air."	non-experiential
yes, they go through filters	non-experiential
but it is quite noticeable when those filters need to be changed, airflow decreases dramatically.	unverifiable
with airlines scrambling to make money, non safety related items take a back seat and those expensive filters, i believe, are not changed as often.	non-experiential
also, your point about the number of people that died aboard a flight is only part of the question.	unverifiable
airport crash fire and rescue facilities would be a valuable asset for those statistics as they are the ones to meet a flight if a passenger was ill.	unverifiable
yes, most airlines pay flight crew members scheduled flight time or actual time away from the gate whichever is more.	non-experiential
"eg. if a flight is scheduled for 2 hours ""block to block""  but it takes 3 to fly it, the crew gets 3."	non-experiential
if the flight leaves that gate and returns 2.5 hours later, most airlines only pay that crew either the 2.0 scheduled  or much less.	non-experiential
for most crewmembers, the notion that 1 hour at the gate, 2.5 hours of sitting on that taxiway and only get paid for 2 is not very palatable.	unverifiable
whereas sitting for 2.5 hours then fly 2 totals 4.5.	non-experiential
it is mostly the pay structure of pilots or flight attendants that poorly designed.	unverifiable
most people would balk at the notion of working 4.5 hours and getting paid for 2.	unverifiable
i also agree with others who have suggested that if the airline changes your itinerary after you've paid, you should have the right to get a full refund on that trip.	unverifiable
i think these are appropriate for both foreign and domestic flights, and should be part of the carriers contract of carriage.	unverifiable
for those arguing that regulating the industry will raise prices, i'd suggest they look at the history of other regulated injuries.	unverifiable
often the changes industry have had to implement to comply with government regulations have led to them becoming more efficient organizations.	unverifiable
and in these cases prices have gone down not up.	non-experiential
remember, the airlines are not just carrying cargo, they're transporting human beings.	non-experiential
and it's important that there be enforceable standards for how these humans are to be treated when in the sky.	unverifiable
you make an excellent point!	unverifiable
but the way slots are allotted at airports has created monopolies in many markets.	unverifiable
"so there is, in reality, no ""competition"" which would solve the problems consumers are having in the air."	unverifiable
its time for the government to step in and make sure that passengers are treated respectfully and that codes of conduct are standardized across the industry.	unverifiable
if you look at the history of other industries you'll find that government regulations have not caused prices to rise.	non-experiential
in fact, regulations have forced these industries to be more efficient and prices have actually dropped.	non-experiential
so i think this argument is a spurious one.	unverifiable
the dot should require posting of occupancy based rates similarly to the posting of one way fares.	unverifiable
the purchase price quoted should be the purchase price.	unverifiable
the idea that a consumer could purchase a product and weeks or months later after vacation time has been booked at work and other plans made, the price could be increased is absolutely wrong.	unverifiable
the only additions to an airfare should be government mandated taxes and fees.	unverifiable
fuel, for example, is part of the airline's basic cost.	non-experiential
it should not be an add on to a fare, but part of it.	unverifiable
if an airline wants to charge more on a certain day, the base fare should include that charge.	unverifiable
it should never be added on.	unverifiable
and the proposed rule that the total fare be shown is the only appropriate way to avoid deceptive practices.	unverifiable
if an airline wishes to inform a customer about the cost of taxes, is should be allowed to list the base fare before taxes in no greater than 1 or 2 the typeface of the total fare along with the total fare.	unverifiable
i have been allergic to peanuts for nearly 40-years!	experiential
i typically fly southwest airlines - a leading airline in distributing peanuts to passengers as the only snack on many of their flights.	experiential
after a typical flight, i will have itchy, watery eyes sometimes to the point where i can barely keep my eyes open.	experiential
luckily my allergy is not as bad as many -	unverifiable
in southwest's defense, if i would call ahead of time and inform them i was allergic to peanuts they would gladly air out the aircraft and refrain from serving peanuts on my flight.	experiential
i do appreciate people's comments regarding the absurdity of such an all-encompassing rule.	unverifiable
i think an effective and simple solution might be to ask passengers either verbally when tickets are purchased person-to-person, or via a question prior to an e-ticket purchase that asks the traveler if they are allergic to peanuts.	unverifiable
if yes - then that particular flight can be aired out of prior peanuts and peanuts not served on that flight.	non-experiential
i look forward to seeing the outcome to this issue.	unverifiable
the notification isn't so much a problem at most airports.	unverifiable
the electronic boards are usually updated minute by minute.	non-experiential
"the problem is that the airlines will say ""flight 100, delayed till 7:00pm."" then ""flight 100, delayed till 7:05pm""."	unverifiable
and so on and so forth.	non-experiential
they're notifying everyone...with completely useless information.	unverifiable
forcing them to do so more frequently isn't going to fix a thing.	unverifiable
package services refund based on service actually rendered,	non-experiential
two hours is reasonable in most cases.	unverifiable
it depends on the passenger, and may require more complex itenerary tracking.	unverifiable
no big deal.	unverifiable
if i had been flying somewhere to take a cruise, that could have been a very big deal.	unverifiable
some carriers already do this, in certain circumstances.	non-experiential
i have been able to get refunds from regional carriers for taking a bus.	experiential
it is, however, impossible to get this information from the central reservations number ,	experiential
and the lines at the airport are usually so long that it's almost impossible to talk with anyone from the regional carrier to find out if the refund applies.	unverifiable
mandating it would simply enforce an already unwritten policy, and provide guidance to the central reservations people about what compensation is due.	unverifiable
i think it needs to be spelled out.	unverifiable
particularly to include refunding frequent-flyer miles.	unverifiable
at 2 cents a mile, you think they'd be more willing to give those back.	unverifiable
some travel sites already have on-time estimates.	non-experiential
i think all carriers should provide that.	unverifiable
maybe a flight is cheap, but never actually takes off.	unverifiable
planes are planes, customers are customers.	unverifiable
just because you fly between countries doesn't mean that service is more difficult.	unverifiable
the airline should, of course, only be responsible for the delivery of passenger and bags to immigration or customs.	unverifiable
if there is a hold in immigration or customs, that's a different government department to deal with.	non-experiential
if the airlines decide to reduce benefits in the contract of carriage, that might actually be a good thing.	unverifiable
right now, it's a roll of the dice.	unverifiable
you have to stand in the 1 hour long service line	non-experiential
because you might get a refund, or a few bucks...	non-experiential
i'd rather know that it wasn't coming, and to give up and get a hotel, than to stand in the line and beg like a puppy for a treat.	unverifiable
customers should be able to sue the airline in any appropriate jurisdiction.	unverifiable
if the airline doesn't have a lawyer in said jurisdiction, i'd hope they can fly one there!	unverifiable
i think all services should be listed.	unverifiable
including the real perks like $90 upgrade to first-class domestic.	unverifiable
for a 'full fare' price, go back to what airlines provided during regulation days, and figure out what ammenities have been removed.	unverifiable
then list those.	unverifiable
all airlines need to comply.	unverifiable
restaurants don't go out of business just because they list their prices on the menu.	non-experiential
there's no truth to what you say about recycled air on planes.	unverifiable
contrary to your belief, fresh air is circulated in the cabin from the engine compressors, air conditioned , circulated through louvers, vents and those eyeball graspers above your seat.	non-experiential
after that, about half is sucked out through the bottom of the fuselage;	non-experiential
the result is that the air in the cabin is cleaner than most public buildings,	non-experiential
and it is completely exchanged every 2-3 minutes.	non-experiential
there's no reason to restrict peanuts on any flight.	unverifiable
the number of deaths per year due to anaphylaxis  is much, much smaller than other causes of death .	non-experiential
people who actually suffer from a severe allergic reaction to peanuts know what precautions to take,	unverifiable
and their condition should never infringe on the rights of others.	unverifiable
if they can't deal with the risk they take every day, no matter where they are, then they should be living in a bubble.	unverifiable
instead of blaming others for their real or perceived allergy, they should take steps to desenstize themselves to peanuts,	unverifiable
which can be done,	non-experiential
as studies have shown.	non-experiential
even better, north carolina agricultural and technical state university developed a way to remove the allergens from peanuts in 2007,	non-experiential
so if the various food companies that process and market peanuts take an interest in licensing this technology, people can avoid any fear of allergic reactions from peanuts.	unverifiable
you can read the press release here:	non-experiential
you simply have no idea what you're talking about.	unverifiable
"there is no ""diagnosis rate"" of peanut allergies;"	non-experiential
there is a common, misguided belief that peanut allergies are rising and that any reaction to any food is an allergy.	unverifiable
unfortunately for you, you actually need to be observed and tested by a licensed, certified doctor for the presence of ige antibodies to determine if you really have an allergy.	non-experiential
furthermore, if you really think that 1 in 100 having a true allergy to peanuts is huge, you're daft.	unverifiable
that would be 1%, which is 3.3 million people in the u.s.-not a huge number at all.	unverifiable
far more people  are allergic to one or more types of dust,	unverifiable
but you aren't proposing that the faa should ban dust,	unverifiable
since that's not possible without shutting down air travel altogether.	non-experiential
maybe we should just ban people with peanut allergies from flying;	unverifiable
that would certainly solve your problem.	non-experiential
with nearly 2 million peanut allergic people out there	non-experiential
and the severely allergic classed under ada protection,	non-experiential
the airlines should not serve peanuts in any form on any flight.	unverifiable
i am severely allergic as are my twin sons	unverifiable
and we cannot fly without specific guarantees from the airline for our safety.	unverifiable
"sorry, most ""studies"" don't draw any distinction between reported allergies and actual, clinically diagnosed allergies, with the possible exception of the language they use."	non-experiential
every one that i've read glosses over such distinctions,	unverifiable
"so you have to read them carefully to see how the ""study"" data was obtained."	unverifiable
if not, then there's no way to confirm you have an allergy to them.	non-experiential
you can be intolerant of peanuts,	non-experiential
and allergies are not inherited.	non-experiential
if you're looking for guarantees for safety from an airline or anything else, you're not going to get that, ever.	unverifiable
you take risks like everyone else no matter what you do.	unverifiable
the courts have consistently ruled against this.	non-experiential
no, there is no ada protection for allergy sufferers, nor has there ever been.	non-experiential
you already tried this argument in the previous comment section.	non-experiential
if not, then you don't know he has an allergy;	unverifiable
you have only anecdotal evidence,	non-experiential
which is often mistaken for true allergies.	non-experiential
you can fly with your son, you simply choose not to because of your unfounded fear that something will happen;	unverifiable
that's a choice you made	unverifiable
and it can't be blamed on the airlines or anyone else.	unverifiable
you take far greater risks with yourself and your son every day,	unverifiable
yet somehow you've managed to live this long.	experiential
you're not able to objectively evaluate your risk,	unverifiable
which is why you fall into the trap of being afraid of things that are very unlikely to happen.	unverifiable
far more people die every year from drowning,	non-experiential
but i don't think that's ever stopped you from going to a pool,	non-experiential
or that it would stop you from letting your son go swimming in a pool.	unverifiable
instead of conflating the remotely possible and the inevitable. step back and look at things objectively;	unverifiable
when you do, you'll see there are many things that are far more likely to happen than having a severe allergic reaction on a plane.	unverifiable
even so, you can desensitize your son	non-experiential
so that if he has a true peanut allergy now, he won't in the future.	unverifiable
if not, then you don't know if they have an allergy, or even to what severity.	non-experiential
as for your claim that she could die if peanuts are ingested in her vicinity, that is utterly false.	non-experiential
the only way to have any reaction  is to have contact with the offending allergen.	non-experiential
so anyone else can eat all they like in her vicinity;	unverifiable
she just has to not come in contact with it.	non-experiential
some people die from a severe reaction to peanuts, but not many,	non-experiential
and i've yet to find a single instance of an airline passenger dying due to anaphylactic shock caused by peanuts.	non-experiential
you have a responsibility to keep your child safe.	unverifiable
you don't let them play in traffic	non-experiential
but we don't ban cars.	non-experiential
it is your responsibility, it is not the airline's or the government's job to keep everything away from people that can hurt them	unverifiable
whatever you pick, someone out there has a severe allergy to it that can kill them.	unverifiable
the shampoo ban is supposed to be to prevent liquid explosives from being brought onboard, not to prevent exposure to some allergic to it.	non-experiential
"sure i can ""survive"" without eating peanuts,"	non-experiential
but you know what, you can also survive without flying wherever it is you are going,	non-experiential
at some airports, there are simply so many flights in an out that they can never keep up.	non-experiential
or, when the weather is bad, taking off simply isn't viable so flights back up.	unverifiable
"i think the suggestion of having the airlines and airports create ""holding"" areas for delays is very interesting."	unverifiable
it would be like a remote terminal for planes that had already boarded and left the official gate areas.	unverifiable
these remote terminals would allow deplaning and have restrooms, emergency and other important facilities.	unverifiable
obviously, there are logistics issues involved,	non-experiential
but some serious thought about this might pay off.	unverifiable
but if they're spread across the industry, i can't imagine that the ultimate cost to the consumer would be very much,	unverifiable
and the availability of such facilities would be a great benefit.	unverifiable
such a plan would probably only work at large airports that experience frequent delays,	unverifiable
so there would need to be a separate set of rules for the smaller airports,	unverifiable
which couldn't really be expected to build remote terminal facilities.	unverifiable
i'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.	experiential
and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk,	experiential
which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the emergency department.	non-experiential
tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse,	experiential
but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut;	experiential
i've traveled with my children	experiential
and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, i've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.	experiential
several years ago continental airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights	experiential
as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.	experiential
so why not hand out weapons	unverifiable
"i've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right."""	experiential
fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.	experiential
now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself,	experiential
we are safer.	unverifiable
however, i know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can not fly.	experiential
my son's dairy allergy is quite severe.	experiential
the world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.	experiential
if his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.	experiential
without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.	non-experiential
but milk is ubiquitous,	non-experiential
and milk allergy relatively uncommon,	non-experiential
peanut allergy is common,	non-experiential
and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.	unverifiable
peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.	non-experiential
as a physician, i have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.	experiential
in addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.	non-experiential
which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching ems.	non-experiential
i've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.	unverifiable
i think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.	unverifiable
but i am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.	unverifiable
this restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.	unverifiable
i am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.	experiential
if i eat a peanut i'll get sick.	experiential
i ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip	experiential
and it swelled up	experiential
and it was hard to breathe.	experiential
it was scary	unverifiable
and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.	experiential
i would like for them to not give out peanuts	unverifiable
so i won't get sick	non-experiential
because i'm allergic.	non-experiential
everybody should drink sprite and eat pringles and pretzels.	unverifiable
perhaps they should be made to watch a person in a true anaphylactic situation.	unverifiable
i have a granddaughter who has multiple food allergies including peanuts and tree nuts.	experiential
her parents do a wonderful job of making sure that her surroundings are as safe as possible, providing appropriate food, and carrying all of the medications my granddaughter might need.	experiential
the whole family absolutely accepts that these precautions are our responsibility.	experiential
however, when one is on an aircraft one does not have the option of pulling the emergency cord to stop the flight so that one can get to a hospital.	unverifiable
this is the reason why a total ban on peanut products needs to be made.	unverifiable
probably not often enough to remove airborn allergens.	unverifiable
our home airport is a delta hub.	experiential
jet blue does not fly here.	non-experiential
flying other companies means making at least one, and frequently two, changes of plane	non-experiential
thus making the travel time unduly long and stressful.	unverifiable
whoever is sitting next to my granddaughter cannot risk falling asleep in case she should have a reaction and not be able to self-inject -	unverifiable
she is eight years old.	experiential
"the food allergy initiative states: ""the prevalence of peanut and tree nut allergies tripled in children in the united states between 1997 and 2008, according to an fai-sponsored study conducted by scott sicherer, md, and colleagues at mount sinai school of medicine . the study was published in the june 2010 issue of the journal of allergy and clinical immunology, the official journal of the american academy of allergy, asthma and immunology. """	non-experiential
our research shows that more than 3 million americans report peanut or tree nut allergies, representing a significant health burden, said dr. sicherer.	non-experiential
the data also emphasize the importance of developing better prevention and treatment strategies.	unverifiable
when trying to explain the reason for this increase the fai suggests	non-experiential
another explanation could be the popularity of roasted peanuts in the u.s.	unverifiable
maybe the peanut supporters should put their efforts into making the move towards the healthier snack of raw peanuts  and see if this will help protect the future youth of america.	unverifiable
the roasting process appears to alter the peanut protein, making it more likely to trigger an allergy.	non-experiential
nobody has studied this subject,	non-experiential
so there's no hard data.	non-experiential
but we do know that the air onboard an airliner is much cleaner than people think.	unverifiable
only one confirmed death onboard an airliner has been reported,	non-experiential
but it may have been as far back as 1998,	non-experiential
no, i'm just an allergy sufferer  like most of the population.	experiential
the difference is that i actually know a good number of people in the airline industry as well as reading lots of research papers on the subject of peanut allergies.	experiential
i tire of the constant harping that peanut allergies are on the rise,	unverifiable
when there is no scientific data to back it up.	non-experiential
i do believe that people need to educate themselves as to what is a real allergy, rather than simply an adverse reaction to a particular food.	unverifiable
far too often, people  quickly label an adverse reaction as an allergy, without testing them to be certain.	unverifiable
then they hammer away at the child that they can't have certain foods or have to be really careful or they'll die.	unverifiable
that creates needless anxiety for the child and causes a great deal of psychological damage to them.	unverifiable
and it was an eastern european airline.	non-experiential
in the late 1990's  the u.s. department of transportation proposed that airlines provide peanut-allergic passengers with 'peanut free' seating areas.	non-experiential
the proposal was denied by congress due to the lack of evidence demonstrating that peanut dust inhalation causes anaphylaxis.	non-experiential
studies have shown that inhalation of peanut dust can cause a reaction for those allergic to peanut,	non-experiential
but the reaction is typically restricted to skin and upper-respiratory symptoms and does not usually result in anaphylaxis.	non-experiential
that being said, it has been shown that when multiple people are eating peanuts together on an airplane the reaction can be sufficiently serious to require epinephrine.	non-experiential
in addition, the dust and residue left from peanuts or peanut products can cause anaphylaxis when transferred to the mouth, nose, or eyes.	non-experiential
since that proposal, according to the food allergy initiative the latest data suggests that food allergies have actually tripled between 1997 and 2008.	non-experiential
that number is continuing to grow and affect families on a daily basis.	non-experiential
my family is one of them,	experiential
my son has never been to a live sporting event.	experiential
going to the circus caused hives on his face	experiential
he's reacted when people around us are eating peanut butter cookies.	experiential
flying is extremely nerve wracking for our entire family	unverifiable
and therefore we limit it as much as possible.	unverifiable
dot wants to know how likely it is for a person with peanut allergies to suffer a reaction on a flight.	non-experiential
that question is very difficult to answer.	unverifiable
according to a recent study by the university of michigan division of allergies and clinical immunology, 1 in 3 people that are reacting to nuts or peanuts are suffering from anaphylaxis,	non-experiential
so it is happening.	non-experiential
i can't say	unverifiable
nor would we ever take that chance.	unverifiable
anaphylaxis is a tricky thing	unverifiable
because one never knows at what point a reaction will stop or get worse.	unverifiable
we take a number of steps to prevent any reactions from occurring- not just when we fly, but every day of his life.	experiential
while its highly unlikely to have a reaction from smelling something,	non-experiential
the chances of having an airborne reaction from the dust of peanuts going into your airways is highly likely,	unverifiable
as is the chance that the dust from peanuts or residue from a pb and j sandwich from the passenger before you getting onto an allergic person's seat and then onto that person's hands and then into their mouth, nose or eye is also likely.	unverifiable
there are many plane trips we have not made	experiential
because it is just too stressful to fly even when we do dose him with benadryl, wipe down everything around us including the seat belt, cover the seat with a crib sheet, bring our own safe food, and an entire back pack filled with his epi pens , benadryl, inhalers, steroid creams , and his prescription strength antihistamines.	unverifiable
being prepared has certainly lessened the chance that he'll have a reaction,	unverifiable
but we have still had mystery hives while flying.	unverifiable
my son has missed out on many plane trips to fly to his grandparent's house that he watches his sister take	experiential
because it's just too dangerous for him.	unverifiable
we've driven over 5000 miles in the last year alone just to see family- taking 2 days of driving instead of 2 hours of flying.	experiential
as for having epinephrine onboard the plane, that is a great idea.	unverifiable
because a person can become allergic at any point in their life to a myriad of foods, medicines, and animals.	non-experiential
epinephrine can be a lifesaver,	non-experiential
but it isn't always.	non-experiential
if not given before the blood pressure drops there is no way for it to move throughout the body and stop the reaction.	unverifiable
there are also cases where the epi pens fail.	non-experiential
once given, the injection may only last 20 minutes before the reaction can start again, only worse.	non-experiential
i would love for my son to be able to fly without a fear of going into anaphylaxis.	unverifiable
i think that any steps that the dot could take to lessen his reactions would be welcome.	unverifiable
in the us, those who suffer from food allergies that can be life-threatening, including peanut allergy, may be covered under the americans with disabilities act  as well as section 504 of the rehabilitation act  which does prohibit disability-based discrimination.	non-experiential
we currently try to fly only united	experiential
because they only serve nuts in first class,	non-experiential
but in some cases have had to fly other airlines as well.	experiential
i have found out that if you make too big of a deal with american airlines they won't let you board the plane.	non-experiential
i quickly downplayed my son's allergies and hoped for the best on that flight.	unverifiable
a buffer zone won't do a bit of good	unverifiable
because the peanut dust can easily travel all over the plane.	unverifiable
a person could eat a bag of peanuts and then open the restroom door.	unverifiable
my son could then also open the restroom door, rub his eye and have an anaphylactic reaction.	unverifiable
i think a ban of all peanuts and nuts  would be the safest route for those with peanut allergies.	unverifiable
if there are going to be set rules, the easiest thing to do is ban all peanuts and peanut products from being brought onto planes.	unverifiable
while this will inconvenience many people i am sure,	unverifiable
it should be worth it if it saves even one life.	unverifiable
and to the poster above, yes, life threatening allergies are a disability.	unverifiable
"the definition of disability is: for purposes of nondiscrimination laws , a person with a disability is generally defined as someone who  has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more ""major life activities,  has a record of such an impairment, or  is regarded as having such an impairment."	non-experiential
breathing is a major life activity.	unverifiable
except the ada and the rehabilitation act apply to public places and employers who receive federal funds.	non-experiential
that means it doesn't apply to airline passengers.	unverifiable
peanut allergies are not a disability;	non-experiential
"if they were, then everyone who has any allergy would qualify for protection""."	unverifiable
you and everyone else who thinks we should ban peanuts and everything else you might have a problem with suffer from worst-case thinking:	unverifiable
there's a certain blindness that comes from worst-case thinking.	unverifiable
an extension of the precautionary principle, it involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty.	unverifiable
it substitutes imagination for thinking, speculation for risk analysis, and fear for reason.	unverifiable
actually, title iii of the the americans with disabilities act applies the same requirement as title ii does to certain private entities that own, lease, or operate places of public accommodation.	non-experiential
that means that those with disabilities have equal access to public establishments.	unverifiable
first, stop reading that propaganda magazine.	unverifiable
publications like that only serve to create fear in minds like yours.	unverifiable
if under 5, relax the sensitivity will probably go away by the time he is 5.	unverifiable
third, go to a real doctor - not an allergist and see if there is really even a problem at all.	unverifiable
this supposed plague of food allergies is the result of very clever advertising by this profession of pseudo-scientists.	unverifiable
allergists are not doctors.	unverifiable
you seem to be the only voice of reason in this entire thread.	unverifiable
not only is there no supporting data for these claims, the claims are from 2006.	non-experiential
it takes more than blind recitation of numbers to make a case.	unverifiable
you're the one who seems to be partisan.	unverifiable
instead of thinking logically about it, you try to deflect blame for your misguided apprehension onto others by insinuating they have a compulsion.	unverifiable
serving and eating peanuts is not a public health menace,	unverifiable
so you need to get over it.	unverifiable
instead of conflating the possible with the inevitable, you should focus on the reality,	unverifiable
which is that the possibility is extremely small.	non-experiential
you're more likely to die from getting hit by a car crossing the street,	unverifiable
yet you're not advocating we ban driving.	non-experiential
that's being a hypocrite.	unverifiable
but a much smaller subset have potentially life-threatening reactions when exposed.	non-experiential
if these alleged sufferers want to live their lives in fear, they are willfully giving up their right to travel by air or any other method,	unverifiable
because the air they breathe anywhere could contain peanut dust, oil, or traces of tree nuts.	non-experiential
yet, it seems very peculiar that these self-proclaimed sufferers aren't dropping dead at work or on the street.	unverifiable
i absolutely agree with citizen_s.	unverifiable
it is difficult to feel human on any carrier these days	unverifiable
and for the carrier to feel that overbooking is a right in order to protect them from losing money is obscene.	unverifiable
recently, when i checked in for my next day flight, i was alerted that my flight had been overbooked.	unverifiable
this was the first time i have ever been pre-notified of actual overbooking	experiential
"even though i am aware it is considered by the carrier as merely conducting ""business as usual""."	unverifiable
my son is allergic to peanuts.	experiential
the last time we flew on an airline that served peanuts  we called ahead and requested that no peanuts be served on our flight.	experiential
the airline was extremely accommodating,	unverifiable
but there were peanuts on the floor and between the seats from earlier flights.	experiential
for that reason, i don't see banning peanuts on specific flights or a peanut-free buffer zone as real solutions.	unverifiable
we now only fly airlines that don't serve peanuts.	experiential
we're okay with snickers	unverifiable
because the peanuts are less likely to get spilled.	non-experiential
however, this wouldn't be a good solution for those with an inhalation allergy.	unverifiable
it seems that antanagoge is one with ad hominem attacks and false statements.	unverifiable
nobody said the aircraft or the air was pristine;	unverifiable
it is much cleaner than most public buildings.	unverifiable
that doesn't preclude the fact that peanuts and their remnants are already embedded in the various nooks and crannies of the aircraft and the seat fabrics.	unverifiable
"the only people who seem to be ""digging in their heels"" are those who think that life can and should be risk free."	unverifiable
that's a delusional state of mind.	unverifiable
facts are facts	non-experiential
and you can't change them,	unverifiable
even though you'd like to do that, and ignore them.	unverifiable
nobody has died on-board a u.s. airliner from anaphylaxis brought on by peanut allergies,	unverifiable
yet you would have everyone believe that such a fate is certain for everyone who has the potential for a severe reaction.	unverifiable
you also argue that people should not be responsible for their own welfare by taking the appropriate precautions to deal with their allergy; that everyone else should be responsible for them.	unverifiable
there is no snack that would satisfy everyone with a food allergy;	unverifiable
the top 8 food allergens are not the only ones,	non-experiential
so the only true solution would be to ban all food or snacks on all flights.	unverifiable
instead of living in your fantasy world of no risk, learn to take responsibility for your condition, like most of the population.	unverifiable
if you're unwilling to do that, don't expect anyone else to do it for you.	unverifiable
broadly - under the ada, most, if not all, americans would be classified as having a disability.	unverifiable
that's unfortunate,	unverifiable
because the language is so loose as to undermine those that actually do have disabilities.	unverifiable
more narrowly, the few good recent studies have shown that of those that self report having food allergies, less than 5% actually do.	non-experiential
many so-called allergies are based on immunoglobbulin response,	non-experiential
though we know that that is a poor predictor of an actual allergy.	unverifiable
because few parents want to put their kids through the gold-standard of testing, a blind oral food challenge,	unverifiable
we are now left with the current situation, where an overwhelming majority of supposed allergies are unfounded, a general public is tired of coddled masses, and the few but life-threatening cases are being minimized by a jaded populace.	unverifiable
once again, antanagoge misrepresents the facts.	unverifiable
allergies are not considered a disability.	unverifiable
if they were, the entire population would qualify as disabled.	unverifiable
since nobody has died on a u.s. airline from an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts,	non-experiential
it is safe and accurate to say that the risk is extremely small.	non-experiential
even smaller is the risk that the plane would crash,	unverifiable
yet people like antanagoge aren't proposing that we ban air travel due to that possibility.	non-experiential
that's the definition of a hypocrite.	unverifiable
peanut do not pose any direct threat to the health or safety of anyone,	non-experiential
people with peanut allergies are responsible for their own well-being.	unverifiable
that means taking benadryl before boarding a plane, having it with you while flying as well as epi-pens if prescribed for your specific condition, and wearing a face mask if you're so afraid of certain death from peanut dust being in the air.	unverifiable
i don't think there is anything wrong with banning airlines from serving bagged peanuts.	unverifiable
it's an unnecessary risk and you'd think they would have caught onto that already.	unverifiable
banning passengers from bring their own peanut containing products  is probably too far,	unverifiable
although peanut allergy people should be given the ability to not sit near that person.	unverifiable
it seems like a fair compromise.	unverifiable
hourihane et al  conducted a gold-standard test  with varying doses of peanut flour - on people previously identified as having strong peanut allergies.	non-experiential
the results were ambiguous:	unverifiable
some folks reacted with higher does ;	non-experiential
none reacted at very low doses;	non-experiential
some self-reported reactions to placebos	non-experiential
which they shouldn't;	unverifiable
and some known to have peanut allergies reported no reaction to high peanut doses.	non-experiential
in another paper,  the same author found that peanut oil poses little risk to patients with known peanut allergies.	non-experiential
many other papers have found  have shown that those with positive reactions to the food challenge are significantly less than those with positive skin prick reactions .	non-experiential
i don't know of a single study that has shown that airborne peanut matter can cause a severe reaction	unverifiable
maybe one is out there;	non-experiential
if so, can someone post the citation.	unverifiable
"in short, the available research shows that confirmed allergies are much less common than folks think, and even people with ""known"" allergies fail to respond to food challenges."	non-experiential
i think the dot needs to consider this very carefully when deciding whether to ban peanuts from flights.	unverifiable
it doesn't appear so.	unverifiable
there is indeed plenty wrong with the very idea that airlines should be banned from serving peanuts.	unverifiable
not only does it shift responsibility for the problems of a very small minority of people onto others,	unverifiable
but it also accomplishes nothing,	unverifiable
as peanuts and pieces of them are already on-board the aircraft.	non-experiential
at the same time, there is negligible risk to peanut allergy sufferers, as evidenced by the data.	unverifiable
antanagoge, then everyone is disabled.	unverifiable
but his arguments are deeply flawed.	unverifiable
allergies are not disabilities.	unverifiable
people with spinal cord injuries, missing limbs, brain damage, and other abnormal birth defects are disabled;	non-experiential
allergy sufferers are not.	unverifiable
and we shouldn't grant pity to allergy sufferers, either.	unverifiable
the argument that nobody has died due to anaphylaxis on-board a u.s. airline because they avoid flying due to the risk of an allergic reaction is preposterous and unsupported by any data.	unverifiable
comparisons of anaphylaxis to other risks is completely valid.	unverifiable
the fact that antanagoge and others would like to ignore them illustrates their mindset perfectly: assuming the worst possible outcome is a certainty, even in the face of scientific data showing it to be extremely rare and unlikely.	unverifiable
despite antanagoge's implied claim, there is no peer-reviewed research that shows anything but the fact that peanut allergies are much less widespread and severe than faan would like everyone to believe.	unverifiable
if he thinks there's contrary data, he should cite it and provide a link to the full text.	unverifiable
not being able to serve peanuts on-board an airliner because of a very few who think they're doomed if they're exposed to peanuts is not a reasonable accommodation,	unverifiable
it's a form of terrorism.	unverifiable
trying to frighten everyone else into bending to your will, thus reinforcing your unfounded beliefs and fears.	unverifiable
there's no inconvenience to peanut allergy sufferers to not eat peanuts,	unverifiable
but there is an inconvenience to everyone else if they can't be served peanuts , or even have their own.	unverifiable
that's hypocrisy.	unverifiable
there is indeed something wrong with banning peanuts on airlines.	unverifiable
despite the unfounded fears of certain death if they're exposed to peanuts, no one has died from anaphylaxis from exposure to peanuts, peanut dust, or peanut oil on-board a u.s. airliner.	non-experiential
these are two very different issues.	unverifiable
i would be indifferent to rules preventing airlines from serving peanuts	unverifiable
actually, i would welcome it,	unverifiable
because i like the crackers better!.	unverifiable
no.	unverifiable
and honestly, people would be more effective using market forces to convince airlines to change their menus.	unverifiable
i do have a cousin who legitimately goes into anaphylactic shock at exposure to peanuts.	experiential
it's not a joking matter;	unverifiable
i would guess we have fewer complications	unverifiable
because people with peanut issues don't fly.	non-experiential
but this is a minority,	non-experiential
and i would not support a ban on peanuts existing on an airplane.	unverifiable
this reaction isn't actually about peanuts at all.	unverifiable
i've seen these people bring buffets on the plane with them	experiential
and you can't control where this was prepared or purchased.	unverifiable
i travel on a plane almost every week, mostly domestic and occasionally internationally.	experiential
our society is one of tolerance and acceptance provided my issues, problems, conditions don't infringe upon others rights.	unverifiable
flying is not a constitutional right	non-experiential
it is an opportunity which one may choose to participate in or not.	unverifiable
"to single one group of individuals out for protection"" at the cost to all others is wrong."	unverifiable
if we are going down this road i would suggest other regulations as well:	unverifiable
i have flown into china during sars and mexico during the h1n1 outbreak,	experiential
after flying for over 8 million miles i have seen all of the conditions i describe above.	experiential
but i have never seen a peanut reaction.	experiential
"to mandate a ""peanut-free buffer zone around a passenger"" goes against everything our country stands for independence, freedom of choice, pursuit of happiness, and prohibition of the federal government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"	unverifiable
after typing my comments i read yours	experiential
i suspect the people who are behind this rule change fly once a year to disneyland	unverifiable
and they want to change the rules for those of us who actually fly regularly.	unverifiable
i have had a nut allergy for my whole life	experiential
and i am not just allergic to peanuts.	experiential
i am actually allergic to all nuts.	experiential
i can say from personal travel experience that when people eat nuts on an airplane i feel uncomfortable.	unverifiable
i feel that airlines should strive to create the best experience possible	unverifiable
and i don't see how they can do that when i sit in my seat and try to hold my breath for as long as possible in order to avoid the horrible smell of nuts.	unverifiable
on a side note, the fact that they only serve peanuts is extremely inconvenient for me	unverifiable
because then there is no food for me to eat	unverifiable
as i am allergic to it.	experiential
i think that an overall ban on all nuts and nut products on airlines should be implemented.	unverifiable
it would be the easiest and most effective option.	unverifiable
i don't think it should matter that airlines are private companies.	unverifiable
that shouldn't be a deciding factor on whether or not they have to deal with people's problems.	unverifiable
additionally, there are plenty of other snacks that can be offered on planes.	unverifiable
for example, jet blue offers a wide variety of options like chips.	non-experiential
airlines are extremely inconsiderate when it comes to nut allergies.	unverifiable
i am very cautious and so are my parents	unverifiable
but i have had problems on flights	unverifiable
even though we called in advance to make sure that they knew i had an allergy.	experiential
in one instance, i was served a meal on a lufthansa flight that actually had nuts in it after we had called them multiple times to tell them to have a separate meal prepared for me.	experiential
that's just careless behavior that could have resulted in a very severe reaction had i not taken my medication in time.	unverifiable
i think a buffer zone would be ineffective	unverifiable
because i can smell people eating nuts even when they are not next to me.	unverifiable
i hope that something is done to eliminate nuts for airplanes so that others don't have to go through the awful experiences i have had.	unverifiable
didn't think so.	unverifiable
nuff said.	unverifiable
an estimated  125 to 150 deaths occur in the united states every year due to food-related anaphylaxis.	non-experiential
about 2 or 3rds of those are thought to be caused by peanuts.	non-experiential
given that peanut allergy is by far the most prevalent of the food allergies, that proportion would make sense.	unverifiable
the question is not if anyone has died from ingestion of peanuts.	unverifiable
clearly, the answer is yes, and that has been proven.	unverifiable
the question at hand is whether that merits somehow banning peanuts from air travel.	unverifiable
the buffer zone does not work.	unverifiable
it also singles out the person and makes the people in the buffer zone upset that they had to sit there.	unverifiable
i wish it were imagined -	unverifiable
and she has had a reaction on a plane due to peanuts being served.	experiential
the doctor above understands that the peanut allergy is different from most ofter food allergies because in it life threatening.	non-experiential
i don't understand how not being able to eat peanuts for a few hours out of your life is worth putting another life at risk.	unverifiable
i would love the links to those studies also.	unverifiable
i unfortunately have seen my daughter have an allergic reaction to inhalation of peanut dust twice-once on an airplane and once in a restaurant we entered before we were aware of the peanut shells all over the floor.	experiential
her face swelled	experiential
and her eyes completely swelled shut-something i would label as a serious reaction.	experiential
she was too young for it to be from stress.	unverifiable
i don't have any studies to back it up - just what i witnessed.	experiential
i don't think the dot should monitor what each person brings onto the flight - there is a big difference if 150 people open up peanut packs verses 5-10 people bringing on their own snacks.	unverifiable
there already is a cure;	non-experiential
it just isn't available yet.	non-experiential
no, the dot believes severe peanut allergies count as a disability,	non-experiential
but their belief means nothing.	unverifiable
congress has the final say as to whether or not they agree and want to continue funding for such a position.	non-experiential
a search of westlaw came up with no federal court rulings in favor of such a position.	non-experiential
banning peanuts isn't a solution at all,	unverifiable
the only way to get rid of it would be to remove all the seats and the sub-floor and replace them both.	non-experiential
that's not only economically unfeasible for the airline,	non-experiential
but the cost per fight would increase dramatically.	unverifiable
but the fact that the plane is already contaminated and nobody has died from their proclaimed severe peanut allergy is evidence that their condition isn't nearly as dire and they believe, or that they would have everyone else believe.	unverifiable
i did suggest wearing masks before,	experiential
perhaps because they thought the very idea was beneath them, or somehow inconsiderate of their condition.	unverifiable
either way, it's indicative that they don't want to take responsibility for their own condition and want society to cater to their fears and prejudices.	unverifiable
try a google search.	unverifiable
"again, ""breathing"" is defined as a ""major life function"""	non-experiential
"and it's pretty hard to argue that completely closed airways through anaphylaxis do not constitute a ""substantial limiting""."	unverifiable
whether or not the federal government has specifically ruled on this, i don't know.	non-experiential
if the courts simply haven't addressed this yet, which, frankly, seems unlikely considering how many organizations and websites i've found that reference successful cases of workplace discrimination under the ada for individuals with allergies, the fact is, when they do, they almost certainly will  recognize this as a conditional disability qualifying under the ada for the reasons above.	unverifiable
as i understand it, the concern is not over trace amounts of oil and dust that have been absorbed or trapped by fabric,	unverifiable
it's over the clouds of fresh dust that are released when a package is opened and dispersed throughout the plane via the central air system or from the overhead air jets.	unverifiable
the oils in the fabric will most likely have been absorbed down below the surface level	non-experiential
and the dust trapped by the fabric is unlikely to be dislodged in significant quantities short of someone actively beating the seats as one would a rug.	unverifiable
i'm not sure why you continue to question the potential severity of peanut allergies.	unverifiable
there's a very large body of medical documentation establishing, quite thoroughly, just how severe these allergies can be	non-experiential
and others on this site have mentioned that nut allergies account for the majority of food-allergy caused death.	non-experiential
whether or not anyone on an airplane has died from this, yet, is irrelevant.	unverifiable
from what i've gathered reading the comments here, people with peanut allergies severe enough to warrant immediate medical attention, because of their fears, do not generally fly on airplanes.	non-experiential
very small population to begin with and widespread self-imposed flying ban = no deaths, yet, on an airplane.	unverifiable
however, the whole point of the ada is to ensure that americans with disabilities do not have to forgo things such as flight because of their disability.	unverifiable
the problem, right now, isn't people dying of anaphylaxis on airplanes,	unverifiable
it's american citizens being unable, because of their disability, to participate in a normal, every day activity that they otherwise would be able to, with minor accommodation.	unverifiable
i do agree with you that banning peanuts  on flights is not the right way to go.	unverifiable
instead of worrying about one particular person and what motivation they may or may not have had in ignoring your first recommendation of it, why not help the overall cause here by continuing to advocate that airlines provide, upon request, masks, gloves, and cleanroom suits so that those who do take responsibility for their own condition can enjoy the freedom air travel provides the rest of us us citizens.	unverifiable
an epi-pen will not stop the reaction, unless the allergen is removed, or the patient is removed from the air containing the allergen.	non-experiential
this is impossible in the confined space of an airplane.	non-experiential
and some people may have to fly	unverifiable
because governments require them to be certain places at certain times .	non-experiential
there are no masks that stop proteins.	non-experiential
they itch.	unverifiable
try having your airway swell shut and fill with mucus.	unverifiable
you are dead in 3 minutes.	non-experiential
your claim is specious at best.	unverifiable
you can't be exposed to an allergen that is wrapped, and therefore not exposed to the air.	non-experiential
if you really believe the dot would let anyone cause any claimed allergen from a flight, you are daft.	unverifiable
everyone is allergic to something,	non-experiential
so that would mean an empty plane, as well as an undue burden on other passengers and the airlines.	unverifiable
it's not going to happen,	unverifiable
so you might as well stay home and live behind that plastic sheeting of yours.	unverifiable
air is not recirculated on airplanes.	non-experiential
that's a myth that you need to abandon.	unverifiable
the air on-board is cleaner than most public buildings.	non-experiential
if you want your own air supply, bring it from home,	unverifiable
since you're not breathing the air inside your house or apartment.	non-experiential
good luck with that.	unverifiable
tiffany 462, an epi-pen stops the reaction for a few minutes at most.	non-experiential
during that time, the allergen must be removed,	non-experiential
or the allergic person must be removed from the allergen.	non-experiential
there is probably not an airport within reach during the time the epi-pen works.	non-experiential
your nonsense has to stop.	unverifiable
some people are required to fly, often by government decree .	non-experiential
a federal court case in which an airport and airlines were tried for non-compliance with the ada.	non-experiential
airplanes are considered private entities governed by title iii of the ada	non-experiential
the air carrier access act- a non-ada body of regulations governing treatment of disabled passengers on commercial airlines.	non-experiential
safety and peace of mind for allergy sufferers without inconveniencing anyone else- priceless	unverifiable
i think this is way beyond necessary.	unverifiable
but i have not heard of anyone dying on a plane because of peanuts.	experiential
please!	unverifiable
this is getting really out of hand.	unverifiable
after peanuts next thing will be strawberries or shell fish.	unverifiable
this is not necessary.	unverifiable
an outright ban on all commercial flights is unjustifiable and would be strongly fought by the peanut industry, congress, and others.	unverifiable
follow existing models.	unverifiable
for example, in schools across america, there are peanut-free classrooms and peanut-free lunch tables in cafeterias.	non-experiential
peanut-free schools in whole are rare to non-existent.	non-experiential
if you mandate the offering of peanut-free flights, airlines are likely to simply phase out peanuts from their menus.	unverifiable
for a peanut-free flight, it is not enough to simply ban handing out peanut snacks.	unverifiable
those pbandj sandwiches are ubiquitous --	unverifiable
so yes, provide a safe, peanut-free environment,	unverifiable
but don't go overboard and beyond what is necessary and customary to accommodate the disability.	unverifiable
i feel bad for the peanut industry.	unverifiable
all this negativity translates to economic losses.	unverifiable
i would encourage you not to single out peanuts but rather all allergyns.	unverifiable
allow people to specify their allergyn and severity, and then either make the area or entire flight free of the allergyn including informing and restricting what passengers can board with --	unverifiable
oh, and they should wash their hands well to remove the oils or allergyns.	unverifiable
at issue is making the airlines responsible for clearly indicating all fees associated with a flight.	unverifiable
when searching for a flight with internet search engines they compare the basic price.	non-experiential
"airlines call it ""a la carte"" pricing and think passengers like the idea."	non-experiential
well, we don't.	unverifiable
give me one price and let me check baggage, board the flight and sit near a window.	unverifiable
and ensure if you are going to charge the additional fees that i can know what they are up front and very clearly.	unverifiable
dot needs to ensure all fees necessary to fly are upfront to the passengers.	unverifiable
although she has never had a reaction on an airplane,	experiential
she did have a reaction to the dust or smell of peanut products we disposed of when we first found out she had this allergy .	experiential
because of that, i know that reactions to airborne peanut particles are real	unverifiable
and it raises concerns for me about what happens in the small, enclosed environment of an airplane.	unverifiable
reading the comments posted, i am surprised at the cavalier attitude of many.	unverifiable
the idea that those with peanut allergies should take personal responsibility for themselves is of course reasonable.	unverifiable
however, just saying that they should carry their epi-pens and other medications with them and deal with whatever reaction may arise misses the point.	unverifiable
first, epi-pens do not always reverse a serious reaction,	non-experiential
second, even if the epi-pen reverses the reaction, having the reaction and having to use the epi-pen both are serious health matters not to be taken lightly and may have consequences in their own right, especially if multiple doses of epinephrine are required.	non-experiential
also, while this is a disability of sorts,	unverifiable
if a person needs a wheelchair to get around, he or she can live without that wheelchair.	non-experiential
there is no question whether the absence of the wheelchair by itself may result in that person's death.	non-experiential
in contrast, in the case of peanut allergies the presence of peanuts in the environment can be life threatening.	non-experiential
the slippery slope argument used by others would make sense if there weren't clear ways to draw the line in this case.	unverifiable
there are.	unverifiable
peanuts are the number one anaphylaxis inducing food substance in the world.	non-experiential
there are others,	non-experiential
but none come close to peanuts.	unverifiable
the suggestion that other bans on other things that are not life threatening would follow is slope that don't find the least bit slippery!	unverifiable
finally, if we consider this as a question of rights, then we have to consider that one person's rights will often be in competition or conflict with another's.	unverifiable
this is such a case.	unverifiable
your right to eat what you like versus the allergic person's right to an environment that is not life-threatening.	unverifiable
if cannot eat what you want, you can still live.	non-experiential
in this case, the allergic person still has the obligation to take reasonable precautions,	unverifiable
but others have an obligation not to create a hazardous environment for that person just so they can enjoy their peanut butter sandwiches.	unverifiable
"howie, you really need to try out this ""google"" thing sometime!"	unverifiable
you'll find multiple reports from reputable news outlets, even links to some newspaper articles	non-experiential
seriously, try it out buddy.	unverifiable
the fact that you weren't affected in any way during flight is evidence that your fears are irrational and unfounded.	unverifiable
instead of worrying about a possibility that is so remote, get some therapy to deal with your fears.	unverifiable
they are unhealthy for you and everyone around you.	unverifiable
bottom line here is that there are a lot of things that can potentially kill someone who is allergic to them.	non-experiential
if you ban peanuts or peanut products then what about all of the other things like latex or perfume, etc.	unverifiable
yet if you ban every product that could potentially cause a fatal or near fatal allergic reaction then you make flying impractical.	unverifiable
as i suffer from a severe peanut allergy,	experiential
i am also for the banning of peanut products on airplanes.	unverifiable
i myself had reactions to airborne peanuts while on airplanes.	experiential
this makes traveling by air very risky if not impossible.	unverifiable
for example, being unable to travel by air can have a significant impact on professional development and career success.	unverifiable
i am sure that we can all agree that for someone with a disability to be unnecessarily restricted in such a way is unjust.	unverifiable
as a mother of a child who had a  mild reaction to someone else's peanuts on a plane, i would like to say that as a physical disability this should be treated as any other.	unverifiable
people in wheelchairs are given ramps and special treatment	non-experiential
which is also somewhat inconvenient to other passengers,	unverifiable
for those who say all possible allergens would be banned, they obviously do not understand that only a couple of allergens  travel through the air in dust form.	unverifiable
i cannot comprehend people who are not willing to give up one certain snack-food for a couple of hours for the safety of others.	unverifiable
there are so many laws to protect the handicapped that i don't understand how this is even a debate.	unverifiable
peanuts should be banned on planes.	unverifiable
i am a firm believer that people should not put themselves in harms way...	unverifiable
that being said, if a person wants to do something that may cause them harm, then need to take precautions to mitigate the harmful effects, or not partake in the activity.	unverifiable
if you want to fly and have an allergy, you should insure that you have medication available and wear a mask, gloves and whatever else you need to protect yourself.	unverifiable
one percent reported incidents is hardly enough to attack an entire industry, be it the airlines or the peanut industries.	unverifiable
no, you didn't have a reaction to airborne peanuts:	non-experiential
they're heavier than air,	non-experiential
so they can't be airborne.	non-experiential
peanut dust could be airborne,	non-experiential
but unless you were not taking any precautions for your condition, you weren't at any great risk.	unverifiable
nobody has ever died from anaphylaxis due to peanut allergies on a u.s. based airline.	non-experiential
that is irrefutable evidence that the actual risk is so small as to be non-existent.	unverifiable
your lifestyle isn't be restricted by your allergy,	unverifiable
it's being restricted by you living in fear.	unverifiable
you've taken the worst case scenario and assumed it to be a certainty,	unverifiable
when in fact it's not.	unverifiable
nothing is stopping you from traveling by air except your irrational fears.	unverifiable
there are far greater risks in many other things you do every day,	unverifiable
yet you're somehow not worried about those.	unverifiable
that's what we call selective disability.	unverifiable
you're not disabled;	unverifiable
that's an excuse you use to shift responsibility for your allergy to other people.	unverifiable
i think the large majority of the population doesn't understand that a severe peanut allergy is unlike other allergy.	unverifiable
"many people think ""oh i have allergies-i take an antihistamine when i get itchy or feel sick""."	unverifiable
this is not an irrational fear, but rather based in the reality that you can take all the proper precautions,	unverifiable
but there is nothing you can do if the peanut protein is in the air on a plane.	unverifiable
it's not like you can go outside for fresh air.	unverifiable
it lasts for 15-20 minutes and allows the sufferer time to get to an emergency room for further treatment.	non-experiential
we first discovered that my son's allergy to peanuts, included air born exposure while flying on a plane.	experiential
he was 5 years old and asleep and started scratching his face,	experiential
which also began to swell.	experiential
i looked to the back of the plane and discovered that the stewards were passing out peanuts,	experiential
which everyone was popping open.	experiential
i asked her to stop immediately, which she did.	experiential
i gave my son benedryl	experiential
and fortunately this sufficed-this time.	unverifiable
we were very lucky.	unverifiable
it is terrifying to be mid-flight and think that your child or loved one could die like this.	unverifiable
it is also very disheartening to read comments from people who feel that their freedom is impinged upon by not being allowed to eat a certain food for the length of a flight.	unverifiable
it seems a minor inconvenience to be asked to refrain from a food preference for such a short time in order to save another's life.	unverifiable
a peanut free zone will not work because of the air born peanut protein in recirculated air.	non-experiential
if many passengers decided they were going to bring a peanut containing candy bar on the plane, this too could create a serious allergic reaction.	non-experiential
i also think that the airlines should be required to carry epi-pens and an emergency kit to be prepared to treat a variety of  emergencies,	unverifiable
since once up in the air we are captive to what is available.	non-experiential
the reason nobody ever died from an anaphylactic peanut reaction on a flight is because the parents of children with this allergy go to great lengths to make sure the flight is peanut free and often meet with the disdain of flight personnel when reminding them on boarding of the need for a peanut free flight and to make an announcement to not eat peanut products on the plane.	non-experiential
banning peanuts on a fight seems like a minor inconvenience and not a lot to ask to save a life.	unverifiable
the only way the rule can be effective is to ban peanuts and peanut products from all flights.	unverifiable
the air on-board an airliner is not recirculated,	non-experiential
so you might as well abandon that excuse;	unverifiable
it doesn't work for you.	unverifiable
the reason nobody ever died from an anaphylactic peanut reaction on a flight is because the parents of children with this allergy go to great lengths to make sure the flight is peanut free...	non-experiential
yet another false claim unsupported by the evidence.	unverifiable
the reason this hasn't happened is due to one fact only:	unverifiable
the risk is extremely small so as to be statistically non-existent.	non-experiential
unless your child has been medically tested and diagnosed with a peanut allergy,	unverifiable
there is no way to know whether or not he has one, much less the severity.	unverifiable
you need psychological help.	unverifiable
i don't believe that a peanut free zone would suffice,	unverifiable
but it is better than nothing.	unverifiable
however, i prefer having those with allergies disclose them prior to flight and then ban them on that flight.	unverifiable
and it worked out quite well.	unverifiable
of course, as i said before, i think banning them outright makes more sense.	unverifiable
actually, jjmurray, i would support banning such items from being used or taken out during flights,	unverifiable
given that they are capable of doing so simply being circulated in the air.	non-experiential
you're right that peanuts are not the only items that can do this,	non-experiential
but the list of items that are well known to cause such reactions in this way is not that long.	unverifiable
and i would challenge you to find any reason why a person couldn't go without them for the duration of any flight.	unverifiable
ed - i got peanuts served on 2 flights this summer.	experiential
but the substance of the debate goes far beyond simple bags of peanuts.	unverifiable
many of the commenters indicate they want full bans on any peanut-containing products, including those brought on board by passengers.	non-experiential
which means this not puts the onus on the passenger to check the label of any food they bring on board, and eliminate any food that contains peanuts, is made with peanut oil, or was manufactured in a plant that also processes peanuts.	unverifiable
because banning airlines from distributing peanuts doesn't address the issue -	unverifiable
only a full ban on any peanut product would suffice.	unverifiable
clearly, you can't ban passengers from bringing energy bars that may contain trace amounts of peanuts.	unverifiable
howie, you have no idea what you are talking about.	unverifiable
and it is a serious issue.	unverifiable
if you can't survive hours or days without peanuts then that is your problem	unverifiable
and if you think it is that much of an inconvenience then maybe you should see somebody to deal with your own lack of discipline.	unverifiable
we are careful on what airlines we travel,	unverifiable
we carry multiple epi-pens,	experiential
we wipe down the seats before we let her sit down, etc...	experiential
peanuts or tree nuts are worse then other food allergens	unverifiable
because they can be airborne	non-experiential
which is why the recirculated air on airplanes is a problem.	unverifiable
i am always nervous when are on a flight especially if we are going overseas	unverifiable
amen.	unverifiable
well said.	unverifiable
actually, howie, vomiting is a part of an allergic reaction.	non-experiential
allergies also do tend to run in families although not necessarily of the same variety.	non-experiential
kids with allergies tend to get tested by lots of people during the course of their lives doctors and allergist alike.	non-experiential
food challenges , skin prick tests , and blood test  are the top three methods of determining true allergies.	non-experiential
my concern is that the peanut ban, if it only bans airlines from serving peanut products, may create a false sense of security for allergy sufferers.	unverifiable
passengers may still carry peanut products, such as peanut butter granola bars, peanut butter cookies, or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the airplane with them.	non-experiential
so really, any meaningful ban would have to include passengers from bringing peanut products on the airplane.	unverifiable
maybe the answer is to designate certain flights as peanut-free.	unverifiable
that way, the families that just love love their pbandj can take the regular flights,	unverifiable
and those passengers who either have peanut allergies themselves or who are willing, for the sake of others, to make conscientious choices when packing their in-flight meals and snacks can take the peanut-free flights.	unverifiable
what is really telling in this entire discussion, is that each of the supposed allergy sufferers  start off by saying i or my child has a life threatening allergy etc., and then describe an incident where they were exposed to the supposed allergen and either nothing happened, or a mild reaction occurred.	non-experiential
several times i see - 'i got nervous through  the whole flight because i could smell peanuts', or, 'he broke out in hives and i was terrified', or itchy eyes and scratchy throat, etc.	experiential
not one of these posters is mentioning an actual serious reaction that led to death or extended hospitalization.	unverifiable
hives, itchy eyes, scratchy throat - all unpleasant, but hardly life threatening.	unverifiable
in a response to one of my earlier posts someone said that 100 to 200 people die of food allergies each year.	non-experiential
no citation or support is offered for this  	non-experiential
so its accuracy can only be speculated.	unverifiable
the reply goes on to say 'the majority of those are caused by peanuts' - once again without citation.	non-experiential
even if these  s were accurate, this is not a statistically significant portion of the population.	non-experiential
there is a huge gap here between perception and reality.	unverifiable
as mr. mulder correctly pointed out, when you are told over and over that peanuts will kill you, you may well have a reaction when you believe you have been exposed to them.	unverifiable
the fact is, numerous peer reviewed studies have found serious food allergies to be incredibly rare, and life threatening reactions to be so rare as to approach statistical zero.	non-experiential
the majority of self-reported allergics who have been actually studied do not react when given the supposed allergen in a controlled environment.	non-experiential
so, if actual science determines that there is a real risk to a statistically significant portion of the population, i will gladly surrender my peanuts.	unverifiable
the peanut people are correct about one thing,	unverifiable
my enjoyment of a snack is not more important than actual lives.	unverifiable
the thing is, it has not been proved, has not even been reasonably implied that my peanuts are putting anyone at risk.	non-experiential
as a traveler with no peanut allergy, i am nevertheless sympathetic to the problems that can arise.	unverifiable
however, i think that either a complete restriction or a buffer zone should not be an airline responsibility.	unverifiable
one cannot sterilize the environment of all dangerous or potentially dangerous items or conditions.	non-experiential
i believe that responsibility resides with the allergy-sensitive person, to make the decision on exposure, and have the medical items needed to deal with individual exposures.	unverifiable
certainly, airlines could carry epi-pens,	non-experiential
but the allergic individual should rely on their own medication to control an allergic reaction.	unverifiable
i believe, that no regulation should be adopted on this issue.	unverifiable
your child had an unpleasant reaction.	unverifiable
not a dangerous one.	unverifiable
this is not a life or death issue,	non-experiential
it is only a matter of comfort.	unverifiable
obviously i don't want anyone to die.	unverifiable
i was simply making the point that those tales are not here because it hasn't happened,	non-experiential
because there is no risk!	unverifiable
the airlines seem protective of their international flight passengers so they are not charged for baggage while the us carriers pretty much acted as a monopoly to apply fees to domestic air travelers.	unverifiable
once they got enough airlines to sign on to the practice there is no stopping them short of regulation.	unverifiable
a poll on cnn showed the baggage fee as the most hated fee for consumers.	non-experiential
"it is not only airborne particles that are problematical, it is also the crumbs, whole peanuts that ""get away"" from the passenger , and residue left behind on seats, seat belts, floors, tray tables and other surfaces."	unverifiable
ingestion or contact can trigger severe reactions.	non-experiential
take peanuts and items containing peanuts or peanut butter  off of airplanes.	unverifiable
this is all the airlines need to do.	unverifiable
most airlines already have a suitable replacement snack.	non-experiential
airlines need not provide these.	unverifiable
take peanuts off of planes.	unverifiable
safety first.	unverifiable
just to clarify - peanuts are absolutely not banned in schools.	non-experiential
my children eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches twice a week	experiential
and they are served in the cafeteria daily.	experiential
this is a public school in the chicago suburbs - k through 8.	experiential
it is my understanding that non-peanut related items made in a facility that produces peanut snacks are more likely to be a problem for peanut allergy sufferers if the product ingested as opposed to simply coming in contact with.	non-experiential
the basis for my understanding comes from visits to allergy-specializing doctors concerning my 4-year old daughter's food allergies.	experiential
the ban should include peanuts, products containing peanuts , and products derived from peanuts .	unverifiable
so, practicaljo is saying that no matter what she does, her daughter always gets hives, itches, and sneezes while flying, supposedly from peanut allergens.	non-experiential
that is pure nonsense.	unverifiable
if her daughter had taken benadryl before boarding the plane, it prevents those very things from happening.	unverifiable
even so, there's no reason to remove peanuts from planes for the very minute chance that someone will suffer anaphalactic shock due to peanut allergies.	unverifiable
you can't make all risks go away,	unverifiable
so there's no point in trying.	unverifiable
and you cannot remove peanut allergens from an airliner unless you take out all the seats and the subfloor,	non-experiential
that would also drive up the cost for a flight dramatically, to the point that the average person cannot afford to fly anymore.	unverifiable
instead of living your life in a state of fear over something that is so unlikely to happen, get professional help for yourself.	unverifiable
you're not doing your child any favors by creating needless anxiety for them everywhere they go.	unverifiable
actually, i do know what i'm talking about.	unverifiable
celiac disease and gluten allergies are two different things.	non-experiential
the problem is that we have an irrational group of people who claim to suffer from severe peanut allergies,	unverifiable
who are trying to impose their desire to ban peanuts and other nuts from being served by airlines under the guise of safety.	unverifiable
but they can point to no evidence that their worst, unfounded fears have ever happened on any u.s. airliner,	unverifiable
so they hype their claims even more, hoping their tiny minority will gain favor.	unverifiable
"in the process, they refuse to deal with their irrational fears, and point blame at everyone and everything for their ""inability"" to fly, even going so far as to claim it's a disability."	unverifiable
the simple fact is that these people want to shift their responsibility for their own well-being onto others, and they'll use any means they can to justify their goal.	unverifiable
the simplest solution would be to ban peanut allergy sufferers from flying.	unverifiable
banning peanuts will not protect anyone;	unverifiable
they're already onboard the aircraft, along with peanut dust in the fabric of the seats.	unverifiable
the fact that nobody has ever died from anaphylactic shock due to peanut allergies on a u.s. airliner is clear evidence that the risk is so remote as to be non-existent.	non-experiential
instead of imagining the worst-case scenario and assuming it to be a certainty, try dealing with your irrational fears and live your life.	unverifiable
if it was really as risky as you seem to believe, then you wouldn't ever leave your home.	unverifiable
since there are no emergency rooms at 40,000 feet!	non-experiential
it should be obvious to those for whom passenger safety is a priority that all peanut products should be banned from aircraft.	unverifiable
standard disclaimer i am one of those who is severely allergic to peanuts -	unverifiable
for me exposure to even the slightest bit of dust is potentially fatal.	experiential
i don't have to eat them.	experiential
once, i went into anaphylaxis when a co-worker from a previous shift left some peanut oil and residue on a shared workstation.	experiential
remember, aircraft at altitude generally pressurize the cabin to 10,000 feet and when hundreds of those little bags packed at sea level are opened,	non-experiential
the pressure difference propels the dust straight into the air...	non-experiential
which i should remind everyone is not fresh air from outside but instead recirculated cabin air,	non-experiential
so the offensive particles remain.	non-experiential
there's no air exchange on a commercial aircraft,	non-experiential
you're stuck with what you've got	unverifiable
and yes i do carry two epi-pens	experiential
but as others have already stated an epi-pen is only effective for 10-15 minutes	non-experiential
and when deployed you must also report to an emergency room asap!	unverifiable
i have a friend who is allergic to a different food item	experiential
but she hit her epi-pen once and had a stroke!	experiential
epi-pens are not without risk.	non-experiential
i'd much rather not use mine.	unverifiable
"in fact, i'd rather not die in an aircraft because some selfish ""personal rights"" idiot wanted his bag of peanuts."	unverifiable
policies on all of these issues should be uniform and transparent.	unverifiable
"nothing is worse that trying to ""negotiate"" a situation with a peeved ticket agent in a crowded and stress-filled airport."	unverifiable
i recently took a delta flight into jfk with a fairly tight connection.	experiential
we actually arrived a bit ahead of the scheduled time,	experiential
but there was no gate available	experiential
so delta parked our incoming flight on their tarmac and bussed us to the gate in a delta bus.	experiential
unfortunately, it took the bus so long to pick us up from the flight that virtually no one on the flight was able to make their connections.	experiential
then, when i learned that the next flight was six hours later, the agent refused even a meal voucher for the delay.	experiential
the delay wasn't delta's fault	experiential
of course, whether something is the airline's fault is, you guessed it, defined by the airline itself . . . great	non-experiential
at one point, i asked whether i could cancel the trip and get a refund.	experiential
the agent gave me a dirty look and pointed me to a phone line across the lobby.	experiential
with clear and balanced rules, i could have read them, known my rights, and dealt with things efficiently rather than having to be at an information disadvantage.	unverifiable
practicaljo is the one who is uninformed.	unverifiable
reputable sources will confirm that actual severe food allergies of any kind are extremely rare, and life threatening ones are nearly non-existent.	non-experiential
"there are certainly not ""millions of children"" who could die from peanut exposure."	non-experiential
as far as speaking to someone who suffers several severe food allergies, i've spoken to a few who claim that status - hypochondriacs all.	unverifiable
these allergies are mostly imagined.	non-experiential
there are intolerances to various foods, that is not an allergy and will cause discomfort but not death.	unverifiable
even those with actual allergies are not in any danger of dying - just mild discomfort.	unverifiable
hives and itching are not life threatening conditions.	non-experiential
the point is not that i 'need' peanuts.	unverifiable
the point is i refuse to make accommodations for baseless fears.	unverifiable
there is not one person on this board reporting an actual death.	non-experiential
if there were any actual risk, the survivors of a peanut victim would be all over this board telling the tragic story.	unverifiable
instead what we get are a bunch of wild-eyed claims without any basis in fact.	unverifiable
it would be more valid to claim that airlines must increase leg room to avoid deaths due to deep vein thrombosis-which has actually happened.	unverifiable
here is a good place to begin your research	unverifiable
indeed, millions of americans have food allergies	non-experiential
and unfortunately many people die each year due to allergic reactions to certain foods.	non-experiential
personally, we have only had one er trip to save our daughter's life due to a reaction.	experiential
i hope we never have to go through that again.	unverifiable
good insights rdgeiger,	unverifiable
i wonder, do airlines get the amount of timely info they need, say... from the tower or the like;	unverifiable
or, as i suspect, the airlines simply board -- then make a mad dash for the tarmac with little to no communication with the tower.	non-experiential
"create a ""virtual"" remote terminal where passengers could ""pretend"" to board the plane which would in turn allow their plane to enter into a ""virtual"" tarmac line."	unverifiable
"then, when the weather clears, the airlines would be instructed, from the tower, to board ""for real"" and enter the line based on their ""virtual"" position."	unverifiable
"this would allow  passengers the use of the existing  or  original gate as the new temporary ""holding"" area -- as per your suggestion."	unverifiable
i know, require each gate to remain available and open until that particular plane actually takes flight.	unverifiable
and i'm assuming the agent didn't volunteer a number of a powerful 'dispute resolution' manager.	unverifiable
hey, you could have at least had fun with this rude agent by using the pointed at phone to call up 'that' agent across the lobby and proceed to ask your reasonable questions again.	unverifiable
"at least then your agent would have a legitimate reason display the ""dirty"" look. lol"	unverifiable
i think that the rules should apply to all carriers - domestic and international carriers included.	unverifiable
i recommend reviewing the faa flight regulations that a carrier flys under  e.g. faa far part 135 or 136. etc. rather than the size of aircraft.	unverifiable
perhaps these rules should only apply to part 121 and 125 carriers.	unverifiable
.. not all airlines allow the entire canceled value of the ticket to apply to a new ticket..	non-experiential
"united allows you to ""bank"" the value of the ticket.."	non-experiential
there is a time limit of one year..	non-experiential
"also, united charges a ""change of ticket fee"" of at least $150."	non-experiential
i agree..	unverifiable
the airlines should be required to post the entire cost of the ticket including fees and taxes.	unverifiable
banning peanuts is lunacy!	unverifiable
allergy sufferers know they have an issue.	unverifiable
lets get real!	unverifiable
a simple warning peanuts may be present on a flight should suffice!	unverifiable
bumping should require double compensation to the bumped passenger.	unverifiable
the inconvenience and effort needed to rebook in today's world are huge!	unverifiable
however, airlines should first be allowed to seek voluntary bumps and negotiate compensation with them.	unverifiable
only forced bumps should be compensated at higher rates.	unverifiable
i'd like to add my voice to say that all flights should be covered, including international flights.	unverifiable
i'd like to add my voice to say that all flights should be covered, including international flights.	unverifiable
so, as for the specifics, the tarmac delay should be no more than 3 hours.	unverifiable
if having it for all planes is not practical, then planes designed for 30 or more passengers should be covered.	unverifiable
airlines need to get over themselves, and make this part of the contract of carriage, and then operate in a customer-friendly fashion, which includes ample communications when any problem arises.	unverifiable
ample means updates at least every 5 minutes,	unverifiable
and the updates should be as informative as possible.	unverifiable
airports should certainly have their own tarmac contingency plans, to help facilitate any changes that may need to occur if there is a long delay - getting passengers off the plane, bringing food, water, etc.	unverifiable
and yes, airlines should be required to inform passengers that they can deplane if the delay is at the gate.	unverifiable
disclosure on the carrier's web site is the best way to get separate optional-fee information to the public.	unverifiable
code-shares are tricky,	unverifiable
since usually the code-share computers don't talk to each other.	non-experiential
for this situation, i think the differences should also be disclosed on tickets.	unverifiable
all fees should be listed.	unverifiable
including a second full fare price doesn't seem as if it will add much, but rather may generate more confusion.	unverifiable
and this seems like the most efficient way to make the information available to the public.	unverifiable
these requirements should apply to all carriers.	unverifiable
baggage fees should not be allowed to vary between code-share partners -	unverifiable
i can't think of any others.	unverifiable
finally, i think airlines should consider having a fee for carry-on luggage, rather than checked luggage,	unverifiable
which would avoid the increasing scrimmage for overhead space on full flights!	unverifiable
in addition, i agree with whoever said that airlines should enforce the rules they already have in place about appropriate sizes for checked luggage.	unverifiable
i am not a peanut allergy sufferer,	experiential
but as a physician, i have both taken care of children with acute peanut allergies, and also responded to calls for physicians on flights.	experiential
the equipment and conditions available on a flight are laughable for a true emergency,	unverifiable
and i truly don't see what the problem is with banning peanuts and products with peanuts in them on flights.	unverifiable
there is plenty of other food to eat,	unverifiable
and this seems like the most sensible, civil solution.	unverifiable
i don't want to be the one trying to maintain a kid's airway while the pilot lands the plane emergently,	unverifiable
and i'm sure other travelers don't want to have their flight interrupted by such an occurrence.	unverifiable
the unbundle cost is not fair to passengers.	unverifiable
we need to return to level of 2007, before the oil price soared.	unverifiable
airline should allow passengers to bring up to two baggages at no charge.	unverifiable
make it more standard.	unverifiable
"i think there is a problem in assuming that a ""blanket policy"" is going to be a good solution for every customer."	unverifiable
"by definition, a ""blanket policy"" is going to make someone unhappy,"	unverifiable
because it involves tradeoffs.	non-experiential
"if you have a blanket ""no-peanut"" policy, peanut eaters will be unhappy;"	unverifiable
"if you have a blanket ""pro-peanut"" policy, obviously allergy sufferers will be unhappy."	unverifiable
i think the solution is to let the different airlines have different policies which are easily accessible by customers,	unverifiable
so that customers can make their own decisions about where to fly.	unverifiable
this way, peanut lovers and people who are allergic to peanuts can both get their ways- by choosing to fly different airlines.	unverifiable
for example, you say that southwest and jetblue are both very accommodating.	unverifiable
if this is the case  then you should reward those companies by giving them your business.	unverifiable
here is a link i'm not sure if anyone else has posted from the food allergy and anaphylaxis network about which airlines do not serve peanuts in coach class:	non-experiential
i think, if anything, the dot regulation should make sure that allergy policies are disclosed.	unverifiable
however, airlines should be free to pursue different policies to give consumers the choice to fly peanut-free if they so desire.	unverifiable
if you're concerned about wiping down in-flight surfaces, i read on the southwest website that people who are allergic to peanuts can take morning flights,	unverifiable
because the planes are cleaned every night.	non-experiential
you can bring epipens onboard an airplane.	non-experiential
i don't have an epipen,	experiential
but i have type i diabetes,	experiential
and i bring an insulin pen and syringes with me on every flight .	experiential
also, while many peanut allergies are very serious,	non-experiential
"it is still not ""highly likely"" that a person with a peanut allergy with have a reaction on an airplane where peanuts are served."	non-experiential
i can't access the entire article,	experiential
but the following abstract has information on the number of peanut allergic individuals who had reactions inflight:	non-experiential
i think baggage fees especially should be included in the price of the ticket.	unverifiable
and all other relevant fees.	unverifiable
it is not particularly important to include snacks	unverifiable
but anything else that is essential to the flight should be included.	unverifiable
also, as others have stated, there needs to be better control of what passengers are allowed to carry-on.	unverifiable
i am to the point where if i don't have to fly i won't	unverifiable
because it has become such a zoo with people trying to cram oversized, so-called carryon bags into other peoples' space.	unverifiable
"also, when they are stopped at the gate with an oversized ""carry-on"" they should be charged a fee to check it if the rest of us have paid a baggage check fee."	unverifiable
significant fees should be defined as those charged for something that is an essential part of the flight, i.e. seating, baggage, fuel,	unverifiable
and i guess some airlines are considering charging for the use of overhead space and bathrooms.	non-experiential
there is a very real possibility that a person with a peanut allergy could actually die from exposure.	non-experiential
there is absolutely no need for other passengers to have peanuts with a total disregard for the safety  of a fellow passenger.	unverifiable
a similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.	unverifiable
people with allergic sensitivity to dog and cat dander are in danger of dying from an acute asthma attack.	unverifiable
these animals are being stored under the seat in front of the pet owner	non-experiential
which may be directly under an asthmatic passenger.	non-experiential
additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure.	unverifiable
even when there are no animals on a particular flight, their presence on previous flights  means that their dander is still present and a hazard to asthma sufferers.	non-experiential
service animals are often allowed on the seats of many flights by the cabin crews	non-experiential
i keep reading people talk about the effect on them or their family	non-experiential
and i understand their concern,	unverifiable
but i also see them shrugging off the impact that anyone else feels there is on them  .	unverifiable
"as if that doesn't matter because ""their"" situation is more important"	unverifiable
bans are bad things, bottom line.	unverifiable
and banning things to accommodate a very small minority is an infringement on the rest of society and their concerns are just as valid to them as your concerns are to you.	unverifiable
since tickets can be purchased well in advance,	non-experiential
it is quite possible for fees to change between the time the ticket is purchased and the actual date of travel.	non-experiential
as for ticket agents, as a travel agent, i have no problem with requiring ticket agents to disclose fees as well, but only if there is an automated way for us to get that information from the airlines.	unverifiable
i also should not have any liability for any changes in that policy by the airline between the time the ticket is purchased and the actual flight date.	unverifiable
i think deplaning is a bit extreme,	unverifiable
because it could throw an already imbalanced flight schedule out of whack, and might delay flights even further or lead to cancellation.	unverifiable
i sat on a tarmac in london for five hours earlier this year,	experiential
but i'd rather wait it out than hop off the plane and miss an opportunity to take off.	unverifiable
however, i see no problem with regular passenger updates on the progress of the delay.	unverifiable
i'd just like to respond to this as one of those people who needs to plan around meals.	unverifiable
i have juvenile diabetes ,	experiential
so my food intake needs to be fairly regular to keep me healthy and coherent.	unverifiable
obviously, this is important to me.	unverifiable
however, that doesn't mean that i expect the airline to feed me.	unverifiable
i always bring snacks onto the plane  to hold me over, just in case.	experiential
it's hard to predict when you're going to need to pack an entire meal,	unverifiable
but it's very easy to stick a granola bar and an apple into your bag for the flight.	unverifiable
there is nothing preventing people from feeding themselves on the plane, especially if they have a medical condition, as i do.	unverifiable
the problem can't be solved this way.	unverifiable
but they don't know whether all ticketed customers will show up on time or at all.	unverifiable
for example, recently i got a free roundtrip flight with frequent flier miles,	experiential
even though i only needed a one-way trip	unverifiable
only a roundtrip was available for the frequent flier miles.	experiential
of course, i never showed up for the return flight,	experiential
because i never intended to return.	unverifiable
if this flight had been oversold, the airline would know ahead of time,	unverifiable
but they would not have known that i only got a roundtrip flight because it was my only option.	unverifiable
airlines could send out a notice to customers that the flight had been oversold,	unverifiable
but they can't know until the customers have checked in or begun boarding whether all the ticketed customers are present or not.	unverifiable
it would be prudent for a study to be done on this issue to fully understand it.	unverifiable
right now parents, myself included, chose not to fly for fear of their child having a severe reaction in a highly inconvenient place.	unverifiable
personally, i can't tell you that my son would die on a plane,	unverifiable
but i can't promise you that he wouldn't have an anaphylactic reaction that could be very life threatening.	unverifiable
a study would answer the questions as to how often it is an issue, how many people have this issue, and how they chose to fly because of it.	unverifiable
there are currently too many unknowns.	unverifiable
in public and private schools, peanuts are frequently banned	non-experiential
because it is viewed as a disability and would prevent these children from attending school.	unverifiable
that fact alone seems to show that it makes sense to consider a ban in other arenas as well.	unverifiable
i posit that this industry, among others, is costing the american public an enormous amount of time, money and productivity due to wasting the customer's time.	non-experiential
i wonder if a mandatory maximum waiting time could be legislated beyond which there would be either a fine or a credit to the customer.	unverifiable
i believe that a maximum waiting time could be established and that beyond that waiting time the customer should be offered a call back appointment from the airline without losing the customer's place in line.	unverifiable
i support all proposed regulations.	unverifiable
price changed after purchase should not be allowed	unverifiable
air travel is often in conjunction with other other commitments such as tours or cruises with can not be canceled on short notice without penalty.	unverifiable
airlines should not be able to advertise a one-way fare unless it is indeed the price for one way, not based on round trip.	unverifiable
if prices go down, the consumer should get an immediate refund-not have to ask for it.	unverifiable
i'm not concerned how the changes will affect ticket sellers ... it is false advertising they're engaged in.	unverifiable
there should be a minimum level of compensation e.g. meal voucher for every 4 hours of delay... hotel vouchers or reimbursement if a flight is canceled.	unverifiable
my last experience w or  ual cancellation was some economy class passengers received meal and hotel vouchers, others did not	experiential
they indicated they purchased non-refundable tickets just like a lot of other passengers.	experiential
in one instance, the customer service desk agent said he ran out of hotel vouchers...	experiential
there should be an airline contingency plan that is communicated to all passengers involved.	unverifiable
all the real charges are burdened on the consumer with only limited impositions on the carriers.	unverifiable
and when the airlines change flights my seat assignments are all over.	experiential
i have been on flights where water was dripping from overhead, seats were seat backs and arm rests were stuck in bad positions, where the seat was sunken and were the smell was foul.	unverifiable
i wonder if anyone has measured the noise damage caused by sitting in those last couple of aisles by the engines.	unverifiable
i am been on trips where i was forced to stand in lines, rebook on very alternate roots and incurred delays due to equipment failure .	experiential
there should be minimum standards for operation  and direct payback to the customers when these airlines deviate from the norm.	unverifiable
i have to pay them when i do it	experiential
all airlines should be required to list the time at terminal, time to board, time out of gate, time wheels up, time wheels down, time to gate, time to deplane, time out of terminal for all flights at all airports on all tickets sold from any source.	unverifiable
missing any one time by 10 minutes entitles each passenger one round trip ticket anywhere that airlines flys for one year without any restrictions.	unverifiable
if they miss any one time by 30 minutes or any combination of times within 30 minutes, each passenger can fly anywhere that airlines flys for free for one full year.	unverifiable
if they miss any time, or combination of times, by one hour, or more, then all passengers on that flight fly for free anywhere that airline flys for life.	unverifiable
also, tarmac delays should be limited to one hour and then only if the sircraft has hot food  and water on board to feed the passengers while they wait.	unverifiable
the toilets must have capacity to cover all ticketed passengers for triple the duration of the flight just to cover ground delays and diversions.	unverifiable
if the ac is not equipped to provide such services then a maximum tarmac delay of 30 minutes is permitted.	non-experiential
the 30 minutes is from door close to door open.	unverifiable
taxi time counts in the delay time.	unverifiable
no ac should be permitted to taxi more than 30 minutes, of this 30 minutes only 10 minutes are permitted to be without moving.	unverifiable
moving is regulated at greater than 5 mph and not moving is regulated at 5 mph or less.	unverifiable
of couse the airlines and airports will say that they cannot live with these regulations.	unverifiable
it is a simple scheduling issue.	unverifiable
at the present time there is no scheduling	non-experiential
because no one pays if the passengers are just sitting on the runway without food, water, or toilets.	non-experiential
let us make the airlines and airports actual schedule just as every other business does,	unverifiable
it is just in time delivery, and the car company can do it for the thousands of parts in a car.	unverifiable
this rule should apply to all airlines and airport that are faa regulated and operate scheduled flights.	unverifiable
tarmac delays would become a thing of the past after this rule was pasted.	unverifiable
this system would force the airlines to develop realistic schedules and then make the flight.	unverifiable
as it is now the airline can get your money and then cancel the flight after sitting on the aircraft for 6 hours with no payout.	unverifiable
make them pay!!!	unverifiable
the issue that i have is two fold.	unverifiable
first, take a look at the high and low price for a seat on an ac for a particular flight.	unverifiable
"there are well established ways to compute an ""average"" passenger including ""average baggage""."	non-experiential
the airlines should also know the cost of flying and ac from point a to point b at full capacity.	unverifiable
if the low price noted above is below break even then the airline is losing money.	unverifiable
if the high price is very much above break even then the airline is ripping off the customer .	unverifiable
in any case the cost per passenger seat mile should be public knowledge and listed on the ticket along with the trip length in miles.	unverifiable
then the customer can see what is really going on.	unverifiable
jetblue can fly a to b for $89.	non-experiential
detail cost analysis would not, i beleive, support the first class ticket cost.	unverifiable
the second issue is one of compensation.	unverifiable
it is difficult for me to accept sitting on the ground for 3 hours without being allowed out of the seat, no food, toilets overflowing, etc	unverifiable
while the ceo takes home millions of dollars.	non-experiential
what does s or he do for this millions of dollars.	unverifiable
s or he surely did not effectively manage the ac i was on nor did his subordinates manage that ac.	unverifiable
so, why is s or he worth millions of dollars.	unverifiable
let us tie ceo compensation to performance,	unverifiable
now that is a novel idea!!!	unverifiable
a side issue is the concept of checked baggage vs carry on baggage.	unverifiable
people are carrying on very big bags because of the checked baggage fees and the general hassle of checked baggage.	unverifiable
but when you are the last third of the plane to board you have to leave your bag at the gate for placement in the baggage hold.	unverifiable
now, this is for continental	non-experiential
but i assume that other airlines operate in the same fashion.	non-experiential
i was told by the gate agent that i had to check my bag.	experiential
i asked what the airline liability was.	experiential
i was told, after i repeated the question several times with no response form the agent, that if i said one more word i would not be allowed to board.	experiential
my issue was that i had a laptop, money, credit cards, medicines, etc in my bag	unverifiable
and i had no where to place them if i gave up the bag.	experiential
of course that esteemed gentlemen id so busy managing that he could not take time from his extremely busy schedule to reply	unverifiable
so i got a letter from customer service,	experiential
note that this letter is not from the ceos office, an executive complaint manger, or anyone special, just customer service.	experiential
"they said , ""   exclusionary items remain exclusionary regardless of the method of being checked.  this includes cash,...  """	experiential
"the letter does on to state  ""...passengers not wishing to gate check their carry on bag may opt to be rebooked for a later available flight that may have available carry on space... customers may request the presence of a supervisor at any time.  however, the customer must be aware that our supervisors have assigned duties ...it may be a wait for a supervisor to arrive.  during this time the flight may board and depart... we sincerely regret that the situation has left you with a negative impression ...we hop to leave you with a better impression..."""	experiential
in other words, we  got your money and we  can have our agents abuse you and mistreat you,	unverifiable
and you  have no recourse whatsoever.	unverifiable
this is why i try not to fly.	unverifiable
i believe that continental is a terrible airline devoid of leadership	unverifiable
but they are not alone.	unverifiable
i believe that the government should step in a strongly regulate them until the ceos learn to manage	unverifiable
"the 3 hour ""rule"" is too long for passenger comfort and support."	unverifiable
"i don't have a problem with baggage fees, except there should be a reasonable ""baggage exception""  before fees are imposed"	unverifiable
if a flight contains a passenger or passengers, who present or forewarn the airline of this condition by providing a doctors certificate as to existence of severe allergic reaction to the presence of such foods then that passenger must be accommodated.	unverifiable
for those of us who suffer from claustrophobia-and yet have exercised the courage to fly-- every minute of delay behind a closed airplane door is an agony.	unverifiable
to those unsympathetic, please imagine listening to the screws of your coffin being inexorably tightened with you alive, inside.	unverifiable
it is unlikely that  pepto bismal, a ny times bestseller or thoughts of aunt em are going to be of much use.	unverifiable
provide a secured room for deplaning if it is known that the delay will be more than a half hour, at all airports, national and international.	unverifiable
keep us informed of what is going on.	unverifiable
i'm retired and on on a fixed income.	experiential
i have to carefully budget for all trips, including family emergencies.	unverifiable
i need to know up front before i leave home, how much everything costs.	unverifiable
i want the option to pay for a full fare that includes everything or a reduced fare where i can make suitable arrangements before i board a flight.	unverifiable
once again, as a retiree on a fixed income i want to know the entire price up front and not have it suddenly changed or modified in any way.	unverifiable
i have been horrified by stories of people stuck on planes for three, four, six, eight hours.	unverifiable
the very idea that you are on a plane, looking at the terminal out the window, and trapped there is absurd.	unverifiable
these are flying buses, not spacecraft!	unverifiable
i can understand moderate delays due to unpredictable circumstances,	unverifiable
and i appreciate the potential for havoc with schedules if people are getting on and off.	unverifiable
everyone on the plane has passed screening,	non-experiential
and everyone out on the ground has passed screening.	non-experiential
i absolutely support any policies which will lessen the possibility of being trapped longer than two hours!	unverifiable
and i'm not claustrophobic.	unverifiable
not saying the europeans or the japanese or the canadians have a magic solution,	unverifiable
if you purchase a ticket and the airline cannot confirm a specific seat  because the flight is oversold, they should not charge your credit card because you are actually flying standby.	unverifiable
and they should have to tell you that you are flying standby.	unverifiable
we were caught on a return flight without confirmed seats,	experiential
"and the ""best"" the airline could do was put my husband on one flight and make me wait for a later  flight--"	experiential
even though we had a single car at the home airport and a very long drive home.	experiential
thankfully, a fellow passenger offered her seat and took a voucher.	experiential
in no other type of purchase do you make a reservation and pay full price in advance  without any guarantee that you will get what you have already paid for.	unverifiable
i second keiserrgx's comments.	unverifiable
the delays i have experienced have been due to work actions.	experiential
it would be nice if the regulation could apply to u.s. airlines departing from foreign airports as well as domestic flights.	unverifiable
"all fees should be disclosed ""as part of the selection process"" before the transaction is finalized."	unverifiable
this should include code share fees.	unverifiable
personally, i prefer full fare for everyone -- or at least always include seat assignments and food.	unverifiable
eliminate combat among passengers pushing ahead in the queue to get preferred seating ;-	unverifiable
and who wants to sit next to someone eating a sloppy joe out of a bag.	unverifiable
if carriers reserve one overhead bin per seat  that should alleviate the issue of no bins left for those forced to board last.	unverifiable
oh, and enforce the size limit --	unverifiable
the size boxes at the gate should be realistic, i.e. reflect the actual bin size and shape.	unverifiable
i would agree with the 3 points in this post cited as the main flight status communication issues:	unverifiable
* there is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents;	non-experiential
* there is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger;	non-experiential
* and there is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport and waiting in long lines.	non-experiential
i had a long delay in may at o'hare, spent several hours waiting in 5 different lines -	experiential
"2 of those lines were to use the automated kiosks at the ""customer service center"" that had exactly zero personnel of the airline there to help"	experiential
"when the kiosk said it couldn't change my flight, i used the attached phone to call the airline, and was told they could do for me what the kiosk was ""not smart enough to be able to do"""	experiential
but they would have to charge me for doing it on the phone,	experiential
or i could go to the gate and have it done for no charge.	experiential
problem was, my gate and most other gates had no airline agents at them.	experiential
i have had this experience a number of times before over the last several years.	experiential
the communication was terrible and the only was to change my fully refundable, fully changeable ticket was to pay the airline.	unverifiable
"some airline websites  provide the % of time the flight is on-time, such as in the ""flight details"" pop-up in the list of flights when you are shopping."	non-experiential
if not, this information is available to the public on flightstats.com.	non-experiential
several of the reasons cited for delays are air traffic control and late arriving aircraft.	unverifiable
air traffic in a couple key spots in this country is congested,	non-experiential
in part, because airlines are flying more smaller planes rather than fewer larger planes - to carry the same amount of passengers.	non-experiential
this takes up more landing slots.	non-experiential
1 planes are charged landing fees based on weight,	non-experiential
and therefore it can be cheaper to land 2 smaller, lighter planes rather than one larger, heavier plane.	non-experiential
2 airlines are worried that if they swap out 2 lighter planes for 1 heavier plane, then another airline will come in and take the landing slot and offer an extra flight of its own and siphon off passengers.	non-experiential
airlines worry that if they don't offer the most frequent flights, packed especially into the most desired times for business travelers, their competition will.	non-experiential
the government should change the basis on which landing fees are calculated as a start toward dis-incentivizing these practices.	unverifiable
1 the landing fees should not be based primarily on weight, but rather should be based on the fact that the plane is using a landing slot, with only some consideration given to the weight of the aircraft.	unverifiable
that would encourage airlines to choose larger planes that can carry more people with less per-person environmental impact and fewer overall landing slots, reducing delays.	unverifiable
2 the landing fees should be somewhat greater at peak times of day to encourage airlines to spread out their flights more, thereby reducing congestion and delays.	unverifiable
i travel with my dog about twice a year.	experiential
because he is 28 pnds, he has to be checked and travel in cargo.	non-experiential
it costs anywhere from $300-400 round trip to take him.	non-experiential
i would rather be allowed to put him in a carrier that is secured by the seat belt and have him travel in the seat next to me , especially if i have to pay the same or more for his ticket in cargo as i do for mine.	unverifiable
the cost and stress of handing him over to cargo is wearing me down	unverifiable
and i will most likely not take him on some future trips	unverifiable
so they will loose my business.	unverifiable
if the airlines could make their processes more customer and dog friendly, it would make travel much more enjoyable.	unverifiable
i'm sure my dog would behave as well or better than some humans in the cabin.	unverifiable
disclosure about all additional fees that used to be part of the ticket price, food, beverage, blankets, etc. should all be included before the consumer purchases the airline ticket online.	unverifiable
i would also hold ticket agents operating separately from  the airline to include these fees.	unverifiable
they should be broken down again in the spirit of full disclosure for consumers trying to make informed decisions about purchasing flight tickets.	unverifiable
all carriers domestic and foreign should be required to comply with full disclosure of all fees extracted from a consumer in the course of the flight to a destination and back again.	unverifiable
regards code-share partners they should align their fees with their partners' fees to make it more convenient for the consumer.	unverifiable
it is the consumer that is the client that allows airlines and the travel industry to exist and prosper in the first place.	unverifiable
30-minute delay seems reasonable.	unverifiable
i just experienced that our of charlotte, va. two days ago.	experiential
u.s. airways was quite prompt in notifying us of the closure of washington-national airport due to thunderstorms.	experiential
in all i was delayed 60 minutes but informed at the gate over the loudspeaker approximately every 15-30 minutes.	experiential
standardizing methods for updates is a good idea.	unverifiable
hard as this may be to believe	unverifiable
not every one carries a cell phone or other pda.	non-experiential
so airlines should, at the very minimum, continually update on their flight information screens throughout the airport and at the gate along with loud speaker updates at the gate area.	unverifiable
yes, all flights should be covered by this notification requirements, small or big, domestic or foreign.	unverifiable
it would allow consumers to notify waiting parties at the other end of the flight, hotels, car rental companies, etc.	unverifiable
us carriers tarmac contingency plans ought to be included in the airline's contract of carriage.	unverifiable
the reason for the delay, the current status of the flight, etc. shall be communicated on a real time basis to passengers.	unverifiable
it is my understanding that airlines pay a federal excise tax on fares;	non-experiential
"they do not pay on ""fees"","	non-experiential
so they want to separate them to save money.	unverifiable
the consumer needs to know the full fare upfront.	unverifiable
this includes all taxes and fees plus any ancillary fees such as checked luggage, food, seat reservations, food and blankets and pillows.	unverifiable
i also feel that carriers should not be allowed to increase a fare once you have paid for it.	unverifiable
i have had this happen and it was $150, not a paltry sum.	experiential
consumers cannot make choices without knowing the full cost of a decision.	unverifiable
it is deceptive marketing to not declare all fees.	unverifiable
airlines, and 3rd party sites should be required to display the full price.	unverifiable
any optional fees should be disclosed and the prospective purchaser given the option of selecting those wanted,	unverifiable
so they are included in the price and can be paid at the same time as the ticket.	unverifiable
this allows people to compare the total fares.	unverifiable
ticket sellers should not be allowed to raise the price after the ticket is purchases, except possibly if they will also reduce the price if lower fares are later published for the flight.	unverifiable
i normally fly southwest,	unverifiable
which does not have baggage fees.	non-experiential
however, i do think lines that charge should have to include it in the fee shown possibly having to ask how many bags will be checked.	unverifiable
also, purchases should always be able to pay the fees with the ticket instead of waiting until they are at the airport.	unverifiable
i have no real problem if some airlines want to charge for baggage,	unverifiable
although i would prefer a charge only  for more than one bag	unverifiable
most people will need one.	unverifiable
i would prefer there be charges  for people who try to bring full-size bags into the cabin.	unverifiable
i have come close to having bags dropped on me several times by people attempting to lift bags that were too heavy for them.	unverifiable
note that while liquids cannot be brought through security,	non-experiential
i have found that empty water bottles are ok and then can be filled at a drinking fountain or rest room.	experiential
also, some airports do not gouge people for food and liquids.	unverifiable
while i have some concerns about what else people might want banned,	unverifiable
i have no problem with a peanut ban.	unverifiable
i think it would be easier on the airlines to either never have peanuts, or use something else when someone with an allergy is flying.	unverifiable
a bubble around the person puts too much responsibility on the flight crew that has other things to worry about.	unverifiable
since people could be switched to a flight at the last minute, and changing snacks already loaded could be a problem, i suspect this would just ban peanuts completely.	unverifiable
while i agree that people with allergies should be ready to deal with problems,	unverifiable
i do not consider telling people with severe problems to just not fly to be reasonable.	unverifiable
taking a boat to other continents is not a reasonable option, nor is keeping people from visiting them.	unverifiable
since travel--especially long trips--basically require luggage to be transported i truly believe it is misleading to not allow at least one piece of luggage as part of the trip.	unverifiable
if all carriers were required to allow one bag included in the price then prices could be easily compared.	unverifiable
anything else is really false advertising.	unverifiable
and this would hopefully minimize the incentive to overuse carry-on luggage to avoid a fee.	unverifiable
any delay beyond 3 hours is not acceptable.	unverifiable
the plane should be brought back and passengers deplaned.	unverifiable
the pilot should be aware of the average and maximum tarmac delay for the flight and take the decision.	unverifiable
and passengers not give the basic amenities.	unverifiable
this should be avoided on delays that are more than 90 minutes.	unverifiable
airlines should not charge for luggage unless you have more than 3.	unverifiable
food service should be available for trips more than 2 hours.	unverifiable
they now charge for pop, coffee and bottle of alcohol.	non-experiential
you can't bring your own,	non-experiential
as the gate will confiscate it.	non-experiential
i would add to all of the ideas below that when flights are significantly delayed or canceled, the passenger's ticket should be tranferable to another carrier who has a flight with open seats leaving for the same destination shortly -- and that the agent should expedite that change for the customer.	unverifiable
yes, absolutely passengers should be allowed to deplane whenever possible.	unverifiable
clearly they should not even be boarded until there is a reasonable degree of certainty that no long delays are in the offing.	unverifiable
better planning, time management, and scheduling could certainly help in this regard.	unverifiable
every conceivable effort and regulation should be made to avoid tarmac delays for all flights.	unverifiable
more than a thirty-minute notice seems essential now that passenger are required to be at the airport an hour to two in advance of their flight.	unverifiable
however, requiring advance notice by all and every means is an excellent idea and a new regulation i support.	unverifiable
i support dot's proposed regulations.	unverifiable
i never know when to buy a ticket, early or late.	unverifiable
also, to add to the comments below, i agree wholeheartedly with the complaints about too little leg room.	unverifiable
a sad demise for the industry and its clients.	unverifiable
this should go without question that airlines should not be allowed to use their great judgement and keep people on airplanes.	unverifiable
i have been on planes in excess of 3 hours and then fly the normal route.	experiential
why should airlines be given the authority to make these choices when they have proven over time they cannot.	unverifiable
this is ridiculous.	unverifiable
i have seen over my many years of travel, the everyday person who travels maybe once or twice and has no status with the airlines....get bumped.	experiential
they have no power and the airlines could give a damm.	unverifiable
i once saw an airline say to a mother that you could fly but your child needs to get the next flight.	experiential
i am not sure how possible this is to implement.	unverifiable
i agree the airlines should notify,	unverifiable
but i generally have not had a bad experience due to checking status online and using tools freely available for cell phones.	unverifiable
government should stay clear of this as it would equate to a search of bags to look for contraband.	unverifiable
people need to understand there is risk in everything and the government can't regulate everything.	unverifiable
government needs to step up to insure proper protection of consumers from poor judgement by the airlines.	unverifiable
when in the us airspace...all planes need to abide to the rules of the land.	unverifiable
when you visit a country you are expected to follow the rules governing the land...	unverifiable
this should not be any different.	unverifiable
technology should be able to be implemented to make data available.	unverifiable
fighter jets already have the capacity to plug into a laptop to get readings of systems.	non-experiential
formula one does this as well.	non-experiential
i see this implemented via a standard technology that uploads to computers where reports could be generated.	unverifiable
for airlines that do not upload data and or fails audits, they are fined and could loose routes.	unverifiable
this will bite the consumer in increased fees and put further strain on carriers....not to mention airports struggling with less planes.	unverifiable
to me, the fees will need to be incorporated with a pricing scheme that will include a bare minimum airfare carriers need to charge.	unverifiable
i think safety records should be available.	unverifiable
also the lateness of particular flights or routes.	unverifiable
there should be a penalty for late luggage that is based partly on the charge an airline makes for luggage	unverifiable
so if i pay $50 for that bag, it should be much higher than if i pay nothing for that bag.	unverifiable
i also think there should be rules against charging different prices for aisle, window, and middle seats.	unverifiable
since the cost of flights differs so much, this does not seem fair.	unverifiable
of course peanuts should be banned on airplanes!	unverifiable
people who post things like the perfume comment do not understand while smelly perfume can be annoying,  food allergies can be deadly	unverifiable
and it can happen quickly.	unverifiable
pretzels are a safe alternative	non-experiential
and any passenger that is missing peanuts so much on their flight can eat all the peanut butter and peanuts they want when they get home.	unverifiable
all flights should have the 3 hour limit, including international.	unverifiable
and airports should have plans -	unverifiable
it doesn't seem like it would be hard to create a separate area in the terminal so that no re-screening is necessary.	unverifiable
deplaning in a delay situation can be done back to front in an orderly fashion just like boarding.	unverifiable
there is no question that clean, working bathrooms, water and ac should be required.	unverifiable
i think the new caps are high enough and don't need to be eliminated at this time.	unverifiable
i like the idea of the airline giving miles for zero fare tickets,	unverifiable
but if you make this onerous the airlines will probably reduce their frequent flier rewards.	unverifiable
i thought the question wasn't about foreign carriers, but about international flights on all carriers.	unverifiable
we must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on us carriers.	non-experiential
beware the law of unforeseen consequences.	unverifiable
the tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines.	unverifiable
to submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.	unverifiable
lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the faa and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots.	unverifiable
eurocontrol  directs european airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport  cannot provide it's expected capacity.	non-experiential
in the us when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem	non-experiential
competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors.	non-experiential
let's fix the problem, not the symptoms.	unverifiable
"i fail to see why it is a ""right"" to fly so you can go somewhere ""interesting""."	unverifiable
you are partly right.	unverifiable
i would be upset if we had to make an emergency landing because someone did not take the proper precautions when they have a serious allergy and thus caused a hundred plus other people to have a major delay.	unverifiable
"i always like it when someone talks about everyone else's ""need"" not being important when their own ""need"" is involved."	unverifiable
"while you can argue someone doesn't have a ""right"" to wear perfume"	unverifiable
"i would counter that you have no more ""right"" to fly."	unverifiable
sure, but it is not a right plain and simple.	unverifiable
"so, stop trying to determine what everyone else ""needs"" they should be allowed to fulfill"	unverifiable
and do your own due diligence to protect yourself with filter masks, alternate travel, or whatever.	unverifiable
"if you ban everything that makes people ""want to be sick"" then you would have to ban air travel"	unverifiable
since a far higher percentage of people in this country get air sick than have severe  reactions to peanuts	unverifiable
and believe me,	unverifiable
when you are air sick you really wish it was fatal at times.	unverifiable
the dot is correct to consider allergies like this a disability.	unverifiable
having several food allergies, including peanuts and tree nuts i am dismayed by the number of airlines that give out peanuts as snacks.	unverifiable
thankfully, my peanut allergy is not life threatening-yet.	experiential
the more you are exposed to an allergen the worse the allergy can become.	non-experiential
i also have the issue, being a woman, that my allergies are becoming worse as i get closer to menopause.	unverifiable
should my employment prospects be limited to those that never need me to travel .	unverifiable
please ban peanuts from air travel.	unverifiable
i know delta serves peanuts as i travel to and from detroit on delta.	non-experiential
i was really surprised to learn this as i didn't know until i was on the plane and in the air.	unverifiable
oh and the two row minimum around a person with a peanut allergy is a joke.	unverifiable
someone with a peanut allergy is not going to be protected by that!	unverifiable
it should be part of the rule.	unverifiable
as many times as i have flown, i can't remember a single time someone brought their own bag of peanuts on board.	experiential
pixel97-hopefully, you'll never find out personally.	unverifiable
a server allergy to anything can result in death.	non-experiential
and its a death where you suffocate to death within about 10 to 20 minutes.	non-experiential
and its hell for the person suffering as well as those around them who are helpless to do anything.	unverifiable
banning nuts is not a hard thing to do.	unverifiable
okay-but medication doesn't stop it, prevent it, or help the person who cannot breathe.	non-experiential
i too have issues with the lack of healthy appealing food on flights.	unverifiable
i have many food allergies  and have trouble getting items through tsa security.	experiential
it's a real pain.	unverifiable
i'm flying in the morning	experiential
and i'm trying to find things i can bring through that will allow me to eat healthfully on a cross country flight.	unverifiable
i wish they'd let me bring my portable protein drinks with me.	unverifiable
there is no need to reinvent the wheel.	unverifiable
eurocontrol perform similar functions as the faa	unverifiable
but europe is complicated with overlapping atc responsibilities.	unverifiable
what should be done is a review of how slots are determined and how they are allocated.	unverifiable
additionally clear and transparent rules need to be in effect and applied when 'stuff' happens.	unverifiable
for example we often know 24-48 hours before a major snow events happens.	non-experiential
for example if it is determined that the airport can only handle 75% of the schedule then the airlines can get on with it, rebooking  or  rerouting their customers long before they get the airport.	unverifiable
the way it works today the each airline does their own thing, waiving rebooking fees etc.	unverifiable
but this is done with a shotgun approach.	unverifiable
passengers booked on flights that will operate will change,	unverifiable
when they don't have to -	unverifiable
and others will 'hope-for-the-best' and show up anyway.	unverifiable
let's be honest here.	unverifiable
free market principles don't work when two of three industry components are monopolies and really have little incentive to fix the problem.	unverifiable
also, inform travelers cash is an option.	unverifiable
if airlines have been bumping people off of small planes, they are not figuring accurately and should have a strict limit for overbooking or not be able to book overbook on small planes.	unverifiable
agree that there should be an automatic inflation adjuster that would adjust caps regularly	unverifiable
please, how us the total price and stop confusing people with deceptive advertising.	unverifiable
i agree with your proposed solutions.	unverifiable
i think that international should be charged the baggage fees that domestic travelers are charged with	unverifiable
because it is not fair to domestic travelers that have to pay the fees and international does not for the 1st 2 bags	unverifiable
and international is charged for the 3rd bag on	non-experiential
"and domestic travelers are charged for the 1st 2 bags along with other fees as well ""the hidden fees""."	non-experiential
i agree with you kiminno the baggage fees are way out of control	unverifiable
for international alone it is free for the 1st 2 bags checked in and then after that they start charging	non-experiential
and i also agree that they need to meet our needs and not make us pay through our teeth and cost us a lot more money then our ticket cost us	unverifiable
this has always been a policy that outraged me, both as a business and personal traveler.	unverifiable
if the dot can't get this under control we need to find another federal agency that can.	unverifiable
dot needs to do a lot more than just give information about how the airlines can rip off the traveling public.	unverifiable
they need to regulate fees to a reasonable level.	unverifiable
"the public relations black-eye airlines are getting for their ""fee-frenzy"" is their own fault,"	unverifiable
i can't imagine staying sane after being kept on the tarmac for three hours, let alone more!	unverifiable
i think passengers should be given the option to deplane and receive their money back after two hours.	unverifiable
i can remember when it was possible to put a coat on top of your luggage in the overhead bin and not have it emerge accordion pleated.	unverifiable
charging for checked luggage has made the situation even worse.	unverifiable
i would like to see the rules about carry-on's, as to size and number, enforced.	unverifiable
as a person that has been diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy, i believe there should be a ban on all foods.	unverifiable
a lot of people do not understand how severe peanut allergies can be and how long the medicine lasts.	unverifiable
the medicine lasts around 10-15 min.	non-experiential
i usually carry 2 on my person when flying.	experiential
during one flight in 1999, we had to make an emergency landing	experiential
and i had to spend the night at the er	experiential
because of peanut dust circulating through the cabin.	experiential
i've read what other people have said about other allergies,	unverifiable
you can live without peanuts or pretzels for food for 1-5 hours.	unverifiable
other people may die because some people can't consider that because they are being selfish.	unverifiable
that takes care of that slippery slope.	unverifiable
bumping should only be allowed for reimbursable tickets and when passengers are given time for cancellations without penalties.	unverifiable
airline fares should be similar to way cruise lines price their cabins, with different fares for different seats and services.	unverifiable
there should be no hidden fees to be added later.	unverifiable
thus, aisle seats could have one set of fares which themselves could differe according to what else is included, such as a second bag, food, right to use the bathroom more than once, an extra pillow, and so on.	unverifiable
however, all fares should include one free carryon and one free checked bag.	unverifiable
i suggested airlines use a system similar to cruise lines, differentiating fares by categories that specify seat location and services included.	unverifiable
example- in the aisle seat category, differentiate front from back, and then including or not such services as an extra pillow, use of bathroom more than once, free earphone, etc.	unverifiable
but one carryon and one checked baggage should always be free, as also the right to use the bathroom one time and one bottle of water free.	unverifiable
customer service should be with live people, not electronic operators.	unverifiable
passenger rights should be clearly spelled out in the same way that cruise lines spell out their terms and conditions and their insurance plans.	unverifiable
also think airlines should have insurance plans for cancellations.	unverifiable
finally, why not adopt a reservation system similar to cruise lines, whereby a reservations requires a deposit with a final date for final payment.	unverifiable
the deposit can be fully or partially reimbursable or totally non reimbursable depending on clearly stated conditions--such as vacation periods, destination, category of fare, etc.	unverifiable
at least one bag and one carry on should always be free, under clearly specified size and weight limitations.	unverifiable
lost baggage should also be regulated,	unverifiable
airlines should not be allowed to lie about delays and cancellations of flights.	unverifiable
food allergies and other problems related to foods should be the sole responsibility of the passengers and in the case of children, their parents.	unverifiable
airlines should continue to provide peanuts and other foods, whether free or at a cost.	unverifiable
people who may not know of their allergies should not be allowed to sue airlines  for their ignorance or lack of information about themselves.	unverifiable
every adult person is responsible for his or her own health problems, if any, and for those of an accompanying child.	unverifiable
foreign airlines flying to this country should submit to our regulations in the same manner that our airlines must submit to the regulations of the countries they fly to.	unverifiable
long time members of frequent flier programs should not be treated the same as newer members or non members.  information on passengers to be shared with others should be clearly specified	unverifiable
transparency should be the rule of the day in all matters of safety and security.	unverifiable
while i do believe that the first checked bag should be free ,	unverifiable
i think the bigger issue is that novice travelers are unfamiliar with the fees, how much they are and when they need to be paid for.	unverifiable
airlines need to make it clear when quoting prices what the fees are for things that were previously included in flying - luggage, food and snacks, etc.	unverifiable
i say that because if you give a notice about too many fees then people get lost in the laundry list of fees and we're back to square one.	unverifiable
airlines need to enforce their policies of carry-on size.	unverifiable
i have no problem with charging a higher fee to gate check an over sized carry-on,	unverifiable
as it will force people to comply with carry-on rules and make the boarding process smoother and less dangerous.	unverifiable
if overhead space runs out and a bag needs to be gate checked, then a fee would not be appropriate.	unverifiable
i'm not a huge fan of the 3-hour tarmac delay policy.	unverifiable
but it's here.	unverifiable
i do think that airports should work with airlines to create contingency plans.	unverifiable
"these plans should consider the use of deserted areas of airports  where a gate and it's area could possibly be used for passengers that include a bathroom without getting ""lost"" in the airport."	unverifiable
anytime you let people off a plane you run the risk of passengers not coming back creating new concerns.	unverifiable
a dedicated area for this would limit these concerns.	unverifiable
if a plane has returned to a gate for the 3-hour rule then you should allow passengers off the plane,	unverifiable
however, if the plane is going to have an open cabin door for less then 30 minutes	unverifiable
then i think it would just create more problems to make announcements allow passengers off.	unverifiable
if the door will only be open for 15 minutes and half your passengers get off someone probably isn't going to get back in time.	unverifiable
i do not know the likely hood of a sever reaction.	unverifiable
i would suspect that a peanut allergy suffer would know what type of reaction they are likely to have though.	unverifiable
if there was a rash of severe reactions, i don't think it would go unnoticed.	unverifiable
i do not believe a complete ban is appropriate or enforceable.	unverifiable
i think peanut allergy sufferers should communicate with their airlines about their allergies and make the appropriate restrictions for the flight, whether it's just a request not to take out peanut products or creating a peanut free zone.	unverifiable
tarmac delays are airline and employee incompetence.	unverifiable
true weather delays are understandable	unverifiable
airlines should be forced to refund passage for major delays and cancellations which include maintenance issues, late crews, baggage and gate employee incompetence.	unverifiable
the real problem here is not the airline	unverifiable
it is long tsa lines and requirements to be at the gate one to two hours ahead of time.	unverifiable
check in lines are ridiculous	unverifiable
and making you do everything at the gate creates gridlock.	unverifiable
airlines should be required to list the number of seats available at each price.	unverifiable
also they should not be allowed to overbook.	unverifiable
proposed changes are good.	unverifiable
foreign carriers should abide by the same rules as us carriers.	unverifiable
full prices should be quoted	unverifiable
the airlines should be able to charge for anything on board except water.	unverifiable
set a limit on the total size  of bags that can be carried on, thus ensuring everyone the chance to stash a bag, not just those in seating sections 1-3.	unverifiable
and do this before one gets to the gate.	unverifiable
no more free checked bags at the jetway.	unverifiable
i agree.	unverifiable
i support banning peanuts only on flights where a passenger with a peanut allergy requests.	unverifiable
for the vast majority of us, peanuts are a cheap, healthy and easy to transport food, offering happiness in a cramped and tedious journey.	unverifiable
without my peanuts and gandt, i don't know if i'd fly!	unverifiable
government travel is at a required place and time.	non-experiential
mt last trip to ft. irwin.  my ticket was to corona airport in califonir	experiential
but by the time the agent figured it out, the plane was full	experiential
note that this wa a pprepaid goventment ticket.	experiential
i then drow home to wait for my office to open and figure out what happened.	unverifiable
confirmation was made that i had a seat on the fight.	experiential
by this time i missed my original fight	experiential
and all flights to my original destinatin were totally full.	experiential
i was then offered a booking to las vegas	experiential
which i accepted after the base agree to send a car and driver to pick me up in las vegas.	experiential
i confirmed with the airline  that my return trip to california and corondo	experiential
on my return, after being driven by base car and drive and requiring the extra expense of a overnight in a hotel, i arrive early the next day and was told that united had changed my ticked to las vegas.	experiential
this time there was room on a later fight for me.	experiential
end of story is that it cost tax payers' money for the airlines to not accommotate reserved government training.	experiential
solution is that usg travelers on businss should have guaranted seats.	unverifiable
in addition, i missing my initial trainingg and had to pay for the extra overnight myself.	unverifiable
solution:  airlines should pay for overnights asw the esult of their mistakes.	unverifiable
fortunately this is the worst example i can give..some third world ones are worse!.	unverifiable
zones are impossible to control as anyone on the overcrowded flights can attest to,	unverifiable
and who has not seen children trailed by parents toddling up the aisle a long way from the zone that is their assigned seat.	unverifiable
i would rather have the attendants worry about flight safety issues than corralling familes or travelers in zones to enable someone to satisfy a peanut craving during the hour or so they are on the flight.	unverifiable
full, transparent, and clear pricing as part of assisted and on-line sales so people can not purchase a ticket until they have affirmatively rejected or accepted some ot the add-ons.	unverifiable
as long a people do not see or do not care to see them the airlines can slip them in after the option to buy from another carrier is past.	unverifiable
by forcing the issue up front you can decide at the time of purchase if you want to pay for the services being charged.	unverifiable
i believe advertised fares should state the entire price, including fees, taxes, etc.	unverifiable
fares cannot be advertised as one way if the price is only valid with roundtrip fares.	unverifiable
these rules should apply to everyone who sells tickets.	unverifiable
post purchase price increases should not be allowed.	unverifiable
optional services should be offered on an opt-in basis.	unverifiable
sad but true, i think airlines will need to have minimum customer service standards dictated to them.	unverifiable
yes to all of the proposed solutions by dot.	unverifiable
two hours should be the maximum delay on a tramac.	unverifiable
health issues as well as overuse of restroom facilities before the trip is finally completed are major issues.  water should always be available to waiting passengars.	unverifiable
if the delay is weather related it is out of the carriers control,	unverifiable
but if it is maintenance related, then all passengars should be given compensation.	unverifiable
ban peanuts and tree nuts on all flights.	unverifiable
i think we are all looking in the wrong direction on this issue.	unverifiable
instead of agonizing over any set of compensation for bumping rules, the solution, with explanation later here, is: no bumping!	unverifiable
no bumping could only happen with another solution: no overselling!	unverifiable
yes, of course, given certain conditions that could be applied to all flights.	unverifiable
he collects his money and moves on.	unverifiable
same can apply for any air flight.	unverifiable
let them count their money and move on.	unverifiable
once they buy that ticket, they are also done.	unverifiable
in fairness and to offset the airlines' position, at this point the airline would not have to offer up unused ticket credits,	unverifiable
they do not have to calculate outrageous ticket change fee's ,	unverifiable
they do not have to determine a specific amount of monetary credit to any bumped passenger....	unverifiable
there would be none!!!	unverifiable
remember, if you buy that ticket to the concert and don't make it,	unverifiable
no concert company is going to give you your money back.	unverifiable
but this concept could spawn another business, such as one that would insure you if you miss your flight for other than being bumped reasons.	unverifiable
that company could take all of the costs involved into consideration  before giving you a premium that would cover the risk.	unverifiable
that calculation is available well before the time that any passenger would miss a flight,	unverifiable
so there's no last minute figuring that would have to take place.	unverifiable
so, that's it.	unverifiable
no overbooking.	unverifiable
no credits of any kind for missing the flight.	unverifiable
no more problems!!	unverifiable
the airlines sell mostly non refundable tickets these days,	non-experiential
therefore they still get paid for no-shows.	unverifiable
i suggest not allowing overbooking, but allowing travelers to go to the airport and take a chance on getting a no-show seat at a reduced fare.	unverifiable
the airline is still coming out ahead.	unverifiable
my carrier of choice, delta, generally does a good job of this and within the 30 minute time frame suggested so that seems reasonable.	unverifiable
i have 3 concerns around these issues....	unverifiable
* it is common in a delay situation to have 2 or 3 conflicting pieces of information - one on the airport boards , one on the gate information screen , and then a third version when i call the airline or receive an update text.	non-experiential
i'd like the rule to include as much as possible the notion of consistent information.	unverifiable
* my second concern is that when a delayed departure or arrival time is provided, the quality of that information can vary greatly.	unverifiable
if you're waiting for a plane that's already in the air, the time is probably pretty good.	unverifiable
if the plane is still on the ground, that time is generally more subject to change.	unverifiable
on a recent flight, we were delayed about 2 hours on the tarmac.	experiential
the crew did a good job of keeping us updated every 15 - 20 minutes, if only to say they didn't know anything new.	experiential
[the issue was weather elsewhere]	unverifiable
i realize there are medical issues which are emergencies -	unverifiable
i'm not talking about those.	unverifiable
i agree with the 3 hour rule in principle and think it's reasonable to extend it to more airports and all airlines -	unverifiable
i actually think passengers should have less control than we apparently had in this setting.	unverifiable
as a frequent traveler, i was not aware i could request compensation in cash or check rather than a travel voucher.	unverifiable
while i don't want a lengthy announcement of fine print,	unverifiable
basic clarification under sections 5 and 6 here make sense to me.	unverifiable
advertised prices should include all costs, including baggage, etc.	unverifiable
a total cost can go down if a passenger is exempt from checked baggage fees or a seat request fee	non-experiential
but it may not go up by adding these fees.	unverifiable
all charges should be opt in, not opt out.	unverifiable
code share fees should be based on the airline from whom i purchased the ticket	unverifiable
- if i purchase a dl ticket but one segment is operated by aa ,	unverifiable
i should fly under delta's rules, not american's.	unverifiable
a ticket receipt should list any additional charges which might be incurred during the itinerary - seat reservations, baggage, snacks, pillows, etc - with a window to cancel without penalty  after this is presented.	unverifiable
while i enjoy peanuts and have no allergy,	unverifiable
i also suffer when those around me have on too much perfume or too strongly scented soap or body products.	unverifiable
while i appreciate the seriousness of peanut allergies,	unverifiable
if we're going here, let's go here for all allergies.	unverifiable
* the tarmac delay limit should apply to all commercial passenger flights.	unverifiable
being stuck on a hot, stinking plane is what is no matter the size of the plane, no matter who owns it.	unverifiable
* the tarmac delay rule should apply to airports as well as airlines.	unverifiable
* making the delay interval part of the rules of carriage is less important than making sure excessive tarmac delays don't happen.	unverifiable
both airports and airlines should return delayed planes to the terminal as a matter of course.	unverifiable
* three hours is still too long.	unverifiable
as it happens, i have arthritis	experiential
which is sometimes aggravated when i sit with my knees sharply bent.	unverifiable
in three hours i might well be in intense pain	unverifiable
so i avoid long flights anyway.	unverifiable
if i were writing this rule, i'd say one hour is the maximum permissible delay.	unverifiable
caps should be eliminated.	unverifiable
passengers bumped any size aircraft should be compensated.	unverifiable
there should be no such thing as a zero fare	unverifiable
the best time for giving passengers information about volunteering should be 10-15 minutes prior to departure.	unverifiable
moderator - the quote illustrates the idea that the dot should not ban peanuts because you are doing exactly the same kind of things the quote covers in an attempt to achieve something for those not willing to take the responsibility themselves.	unverifiable
do not ban peanut products unless you are willing to go the very many roads of banning other substances as well.	unverifiable
"once again, a reaction ""not severe enough to...""."	unverifiable
here is the problem.	unverifiable
no one has ever died on an airplane from a peanut allergy.	non-experiential
the problem that the dot is trying to fix here doesn't exist.	unverifiable
but i don't know of anyone dying from any allergic reaction onboard an airplane.	experiential
moderator - the problem is if you ban any food product you've just opened the door to ban every food product, perfumes, and an uncountable number of other things.	unverifiable
regulated bans always result in follow-on bans	unverifiable
which steadily increase restrictions for problems that are better solved by individual responsibility vice government rules.	unverifiable
"and that's the real problem. ""...let's go here for all allergies."""	unverifiable
i've said it before and statements like that just reinforce what i have been saying.	unverifiable
once you ban one thing you will be required to ban a lot more things going forward.	unverifiable
i don't think the dot is prepared to ban all perfumes, deodorants, service animals, people who smell of smoke, people who use certain shampoo, and on and on and on.	unverifiable
i agree with jdwyer.	unverifiable
and that should be a maximum of 3 hours with food, water, bathroom available after 2 hours -	unverifiable
and airlines should be financially penalized for every passenger on the flight if they disregard the rule -	unverifiable
and the penalty should be stiff and evenly applied.	unverifiable
might get their attention and some results.	unverifiable
i agree with mthort1 about a baggage carry-on rule that is the same at all us airports and strictly enforced.	unverifiable
in addition, these baggage and other fees are ridiculous and need to be regulated.	unverifiable
while i agree with charging for more than 1 checked bag under x lb. weight,	unverifiable
all other extra fees should be forbidden.	unverifiable
if that does not happen, airlines definitely must tell customers when booking what fees are	unverifiable
- and they should never include a fee for water or a certain-size carry-on or to use the toilet!!	unverifiable
all carriers should list all separate fees and show the minimum full fare price.	unverifiable
simply put, the total price is the only price that matters.	unverifiable
breaking the price out needlessly confuses the issue.	unverifiable
personally i think that if the airlines are going to charge for checked bags they should expect that passengers will try to get away with the largest carry-on they can get away with.	unverifiable
with that in mind they should actually enforce the carry-on size limits before passengers board.	unverifiable
"perhaps establish official size dimensions for carry-ons and make an official ""carry-on"" friendly icon, like tsa did for laptop bags that can go thru scanners without having to take the laptop out."	unverifiable
a traveler should be able to know the full price of the ticket with all optional services included as he searches for a flight.	unverifiable
this could be accomplished by presenting a list of all optional services on the first reservation page.	unverifiable
the traveler would check off the optional services desired and the fares presented for the itinerary would include these so that a reasonable comparison could be made between airlines.	unverifiable
i think that 30 minutes would be appropriate for notification.	unverifiable
however, my concern would be for how this would work in changing conditions.	unverifiable
for example, if a mechanical problem is fixed faster than expected.	unverifiable
i agree with some of the others,	unverifiable
they should not be telling people they cannot get off the plane.	unverifiable
flying is already a pain in the neck,	unverifiable
sitting more time on the tarmac just makes matters worse.	unverifiable
their should be a place where passengers are allowed off, but are not allowed to associate with ground crew for security reasons.	unverifiable
being trapped in a plane even for an hour on the ground is not fun,	unverifiable
nor is it necessary most of the time.	unverifiable
an hour is already difficult.	unverifiable
as stated before by others, the feeling is the same.	unverifiable
the time limit should be no more than 30 minutes.	unverifiable
people have health problems or muscle and bone issues cannot stay seated that long.	non-experiential
one recent youtube video i saw there was no a or c, no water, could not get up, etc.	experiential
that is ridiculous.	unverifiable
30 minutes! if it is over 30 minutes the plane goes back to the terminal	unverifiable
and everyone who wants to get off can,	unverifiable
they just have to stay in the confines of the terminal and not to be late to reboard the flight.	unverifiable
the airline also needs to stay on top of things and let people know how long they will need to wait at the gate.	unverifiable
a flight many years ago, the airline was smart,	unverifiable
they told us to wait in the terminal, for 2 more hours due to where we were flying to was too crowded,	unverifiable
i was much happier in the terminal than having to sit in the plane for two hours.	unverifiable
kudos to them!	unverifiable
* 30 minutes as stated earlier. period, no excuses.	unverifiable
* no, because 30 minutes or back to the gate.	unverifiable
* no idea what you mean by this.	unverifiable
either it is or it is not.	non-experiential
put everyone in a separate place that they cannot leave the terminal or gate area,	unverifiable
it is not that difficult,	unverifiable
it is not rocket science here..	unverifiable
we should not be mandated to sit for hours and hours.	unverifiable
all airports should have places for this,	unverifiable
and let us get off and wait in the terminal at the gate so that security is not compromised.	unverifiable
whatever protects us is ok with me.	unverifiable
i just don't want more fees added for whatever the changes are.	unverifiable
and i am not really sure what you are asking of us..	unverifiable
all fees should be shown on the initial screen showing a price or in any ad showing a fare.	unverifiable
that said, i would prefer the rule to be that airlines return to the standard of several years ago.	unverifiable
any flight to, from or within the us includes 2 bags of up to 70lb. and a carry on in the standard 22 inch size.	unverifiable
when most of the staffs have left and nobody seems to be minding the store.	unverifiable
i arrive to pick up someone from a flight and cannot even get info on the status boards by the gates or security.	experiential
so, yes, i think airlines should keep up their end of the deal until all their flights are finished for the day!	unverifiable
if flights are late coming or going, airline staff need to stay with it.	unverifiable
i find it interesting that the moderator keeps saying the dot will consider carry on rules in the future.	unverifiable
the fact is there are current carry on rules in effect.	non-experiential
a great start would be to enforce the current rules.	unverifiable
this needs to happen at the security checkpoint,	unverifiable
so that those who need to check luggage are easily directed back to the airline's ticket counter.	unverifiable
as far as the multiple, and seemingly never ending array of fees that the airlines are charging, yes, these fees should be prominently displayed as part of the ticket purchase process.	unverifiable
the customer should be required to acknowledge their understanding of the fees before the ticket purchase is completed.	unverifiable
perhaps those writing the rules need to check the websites for ryan air , easyjet , or flybe .	unverifiable
as the customer navigates these sites, as part of the ticket purchase process they are asked to select additional items they are interested in.	unverifiable
for example, when they select to check a bag, the bottom line price goes up,  same for fees for early boarding, sporting equipment, and the like.	unverifiable
the ticket purchase, and the additional fees are then lumped into a single transaction.	unverifiable
in this scenario, no advanced notice of changes in the fees would be required, if once the fee is paid, it cannot be changed.	unverifiable
personally, i believe that every airline ticket should include the first checked bag.	unverifiable
i also believe that unless the passenger does not meet the check in time limit for checked luggage, that all fees charged for the transport of that luggage should be immediately refunded to the original form of payment if the luggage does not arrive with the passenger.	unverifiable
the regulations, once they are developed should apply to all carriers, no matter size of the plane.	unverifiable
no reason to increase the complexity by making exceptions or differences based on the size of the company or size of the plane.	unverifiable
the services should cost the same on code share flights, regardless of which carrier is operating the flight.	unverifiable
i have sympathy for those with peanut allergies,	unverifiable
but banning peanuts from flights via a dot regulation seems to go too far.	unverifiable
perhaps advocacy groups for those who are peanut-allergic will approach the major carriers to voluntarily set aside seating blocks that are reserved for allergy sufferers, and non-sufferers who are willing to agree not to eat peanuts while sitting in that particular block.	unverifiable
"as someone who suffers from a medical condition which requires me to carry my ""rescue"" medication with me everywhere i go, i think that if the risk to an allergy sufferer is deemed to be significant, then they should  consider alternate travel methods other than flying,  ensure they have sufficient ""rescue"" medication to last the entire time they might be stuck in an aircraft, and  they should wear appropriate clothing  or  face masks to minimize exposed skin and inhalation risk."	unverifiable
"requiring other passengers to forgo their ""right"" to eat peanuts so as to accommodate the ""right"" of allergy sufferers to fly seems a bit much, particularly if the allergy sufferers don't fly often, anyway."	unverifiable
airlines do not use uniform presentation of taxes and fees, especially fuel surcharges.	non-experiential
some airlines break out fuel surcharge when taxes or fees itemization is requested.	non-experiential
other airlines include fuel surcharge in basic fare,	non-experiential
so its amount is concealed.	non-experiential
all airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details.	unverifiable
the itemization should also apply to foreign carriers who fly into the usa.	unverifiable
some claim to passengers that they don't know what the itemized taxes or fees are.	non-experiential
airlines should be required to clearly distinguish among taxes, government-imposed fees and surcharges.	unverifiable
"some airlines currently label as ""taxes"" fees and surcharges they themselves impose."	non-experiential
the airline should compensate passengers who get bumped the full fare it would cost at that particular point of time for the customer to buy a ticket on that airplane.	unverifiable
otherwise, airlines will bump passengers who paid a lower fare.	unverifiable
as a result, for example, if i paid $200 for a ticket and a different passenger paid $800 for a seat on the same airplane and class of service, the airline would have a clear incentive to bump me and not the other passenger - all else equal.	unverifiable
one imperfect way to set a fair amound could be to divide the individual's salary by 40 h or wk and 50 work weeks per year.	unverifiable
there must be a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes.	unverifiable
it is a closed space.	non-experiential
i am allergic to peanuts and almonds	experiential
and i am impacted every time i fly.	non-experiential
a nut free zone does not work	non-experiential
since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.	non-experiential
for the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.	unverifiable
for almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested	non-experiential
so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.	non-experiential
this is not true for many of us with nut allergies -	non-experiential
we react if other people are eating the food	non-experiential
since it is an airborne allergy.	non-experiential
i do fly	experiential
but i have to take multiple benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.	non-experiential
this works for now	non-experiential
but i always wonder when it will no longer be enough.	unverifiable
an epipen is not the answer	unverifiable
as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land	non-experiential
which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.	unverifiable
the rules airlines have are ridiculous -	unverifiable
southwest is not nut free	non-experiential
but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.	unverifiable
some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free'	non-experiential
but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.	non-experiential
other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts	non-experiential
but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.	non-experiential
so you can have a 'nut free' flight	non-experiential
and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away -	non-experiential
and the airlines will do nothing to help you.	unverifiable
again all nuts should be banned from airplanes	unverifiable
unless it is your own private plane - then go ahead and eat what you want.	unverifiable
as someone who carries an epipen for beestings,  i understand that allergies can be serious and life threatening.	unverifiable
banning airlines from serving peanuts inflight seems reasonable;	unverifiable
several posts mention the risk inherent in many people opening bags of peanuts at one time  throwing a large amount of dust in the air,	experiential
which could be enough to trigger an allergy in severely allergic people.	non-experiential
i find this interesting that dot or faa would talk about something that affect only one  percent of whole population who are allergic to peanut.	unverifiable
on other hand, the dot or faa has not demonstrate any improvement or collaborate with national association of the deaf  to improve subtitle  or  captioning on all tv programming, entertainment, and on everything that are being shown in any aircraft.	unverifiable
with this inaccessibility to deaf, hard of hearing, and other people who depends on subtitle represent ten  percent of whole population.	non-experiential
i know this awareness had brought on to dot or faa and many of other airlines carriers about this for years	unverifiable
as i recalled my first complaint was back in early 1990's -	experiential
nothing has been done about it.	non-experiential
now a peanut had gotten your attention -	unverifiable
its a peanut issue in oppose to accessibility issue where lots of deaf and hard of hearing people pay same amount of air fare tickets as all other people and nothing has been done about it.	unverifiable
we need a solution here in regards to accessibility.	unverifiable
as an infrequent traveler, i get easily confused with all the new fees and regulations.	unverifiable
when i'm comparison shopping, i'd like to see additional fees listed on every webpage of every airline or ticket provider	unverifiable
i love amazon's page that shows cost and shipping.	unverifiable
it's pretty deceptive for one airline to list an all inclusive fee  and another to unbundle just to look like they have a lower price.	unverifiable
i'm not a travel agent and don't want to spend hours looking for the best deal, only to find hidden charges.	unverifiable
i hate to see this become another federal regulation,	unverifiable
but it would be good business.	unverifiable
in terms of code share, the rules or fees of the issuing airline should prevail across the board.	unverifiable
smaller aircraft should also be held responsible.	unverifiable
i have no problem with the new regulations,	unverifiable
sometimes some delays are due to passengers.	non-experiential
everyone gets upset about a delay	unverifiable
"as far as overbooking is concerned, perhaps the airlines would not overbook if the dot required that airline tickets purchased are ""use them or lose them"" or carry an instant penalty - meaning the value of the ticket is instantly reduced by 50%."	unverifiable
the airline can't afford to have empty seats,	non-experiential
yet people just don't show up or make last minute change costing the airline which ultimately costs other passengers.	non-experiential
everyone has to realize there is going to be a cost to the consumer if there is a cost to the airline.	unverifiable
i also would like to see minimum standards set for leg and arm room done by the dot.	unverifiable
it may help some of the irritation that comes with flying.	non-experiential
it is long past time that the airlines treat passengers, their primary source of income, as customers they cherish and not the nuisance we've become.	unverifiable
it has been said that new fees and penalties will only be passed to the passenger already struggling with higher fares and convenience fees of all kinds.	non-experiential
passengers need to remember that the airlines are still a competitive environment.	unverifiable
if you don't like the fare, go elsewhere or fine some other mode of transportation.	unverifiable
i've also found plenty of international airlines far more willing to treat me well on those coveted long haul flights and have completely refused to fly any american airlines on a long haul out of the country as a result.	unverifiable
they've lost my business	unverifiable
and until they lose more, they may never learn.	unverifiable
they should be allowed to go out of business	unverifiable
american consumers deserve better.	unverifiable
until then, it's air france or lufthansa for me!	unverifiable
"i personally think that airlines should be able to price ""a la carte"""	unverifiable
as price discrimination  tends to benefit everyone.	unverifiable
airlines are incentivized to charge baggage fees	unverifiable
so they can post lower base prices.	non-experiential
in turn this encourages fliers to cram luggage in the cabin,	non-experiential
which is irritating to say the least.	unverifiable
but the issue is that it seems unreasonable to expect travelers to fly without any luggage.	unverifiable
discriminatory pricing should be truly discriminatory* like seat location, not luggage and bathrooms and water.	unverifiable
airfare should include at least one free checked bag.	unverifiable
if all fares were somewhat higher as a result, the damage to an airline's bottom line should be minimized.	unverifiable
1 size of aircraft should be irrelevant.	unverifiable
i was trapped on a very small  aircraft, in the hot summer sun, for hours, with no ventilation.	experiential
outrageous!	unverifiable
being cooked in a small tin can is no better than being cooked in a big one!	unverifiable
i have two children with multiple severe food allergies.	unverifiable
i support a ban on any food with peanut ingredients on airplanes actual peanut ingredients in the actual ingredient list should be banned .	unverifiable
presently we only fly airlines that do not serve peanuts or agree to not serve it on our flight .	experiential
although, once on a southwest flight my daughter had a mild reaction.	unverifiable
we think it was from residue from the previous flight.	experiential
it was mild enough that benadryl was sufficient to control the symptoms.	unverifiable
individuals with severe allergies typically carry their own emergency medical kit .	unverifiable
i wouldn't expect the airline to provide the emergency medical equipment.	unverifiable
we carry ours wherever we go at all times.	experiential
agreed.	unverifiable
the most frustrating thing about airline travel is the lack of space.	unverifiable
i don't see why they care so much about letting people game the bumping system, but not at all about personal space.	unverifiable
i guess the big question is,	unverifiable
buffer zones do not help in common areas like bathrooms.	unverifiable
also, that means that the persons prior to the flight ate peanuts there.	non-experiential
i mentioned on another discussion board that the flight crew pointed my son out and told passengers they could not have peanut mandms	experiential
because my son had an allergy.	experiential
the passengers were all nice about it	unverifiable
but it made me very uncomfortable.	unverifiable
i have seen people be really nasty about asking them not to do something because fo someone else.	unverifiable
all airfare costs should include the passenger's right to check at least one standard piece of baggage.	unverifiable
all fees should be fully disclosed at the time of airfare purchase, regardless of nature .	unverifiable
any changes in fees should be identified by air carriers at least 6 months prior to taking effect.	unverifiable
fees must be paid according to the carrier selling the airfare, not to the one providing the service, as in the case of a code-sharing agreement.	unverifiable
i believe these caps should benefit the consumers who are taken advantage of by the airlines.	unverifiable
"getting the funds in airline ""dollars"" doesn't help those who travel infrequently and who expected  to be on a flight to get to their destination."	unverifiable
as far as zero-fare tickets, they should have a choice between a cash refund  or airline miles doubled.	unverifiable
"this way if it were the travelers ""last flight"" for years, or ever, they can still be compensated for their ""contract"" with the airline being broke."	non-experiential
that's crazy.	unverifiable
i have a young son who is beyond class 6 for peanuts or tree nuts.	experiential
"for him, it simply is not a matter of ""passing up"" on a snack."	experiential
anaphylaxis can happen much more readily for him by the transfer of oils .	experiential
it can also happen by airborne dust.	non-experiential
in a flight where peanuts are being served and all 100and bags go poof at the same time they are opened - well, let's just say it would be a mother's nightmare.	unverifiable
even without a peanut allergy, peanuts are just such a choking hazard for any small children.	unverifiable
there are plenty of reasonable alternatives.	unverifiable
i recall when my son was first diagnosed, 1 week prior to christmas.	unverifiable
i was floored to f sind out that delta still served peanuts.	unverifiable
peanut allergy is unlike some other food allergies in that there are multiple ways to have reaction .	non-experiential
my suggestion would be to ban peanut products on all airlines.	unverifiable
but that still does not or will  not control what snacks others bring on.	unverifiable
so i would suggest they still offer peanut free buffer zones and have some method of ensuring passengers in those rows are aware of what that means .	unverifiable
i also think that pre-boarding should be an option,	unverifiable
so that peanut families can go and wipe down the tray tables or arm rests themselves and feel comfortable with the environment in which their child will be sitting.	unverifiable
i've been on one too many flights were peanuts have been banned simply due to an allergic person flying...	experiential
and i feel so much sympathy for those families,	unverifiable
because the airline staff does not seem to be good at respecting their privacy.	unverifiable
in fact, they almost act begruding or point out the poor child to other.	unverifiable
as long as items are clearly labeled  are o.k.	unverifiable
if nothing else, i am so very appreciative that this issue is gaining attention.	unverifiable
i don't think airlines realize how many passengers don't fly them due to their poor policies.	unverifiable
in fact, i learned so much already today reading these message boards.	unverifiable
i will make it a point to frequent the airlines  where people seem to have had really positive and supportive environments when flying with their children.	unverifiable
great info for me to have as a parent.	unverifiable
i also wonder if you couldn't look into how the major sports arenas handle peanut allergies.	unverifiable
"most will offer at least one ""peanut free"" day so that children can enjoy major league sports like baseball etc."	unverifiable
so it can be done.	non-experiential
and they have way more people in one arena than on a single flight.	non-experiential
the decision you are considering could save many lives.	unverifiable
from the bottom of my heart, anything you need or want to know please ask.	unverifiable
whenever there is a tie up at the hub, these are the planes that have to sit ...	non-experiential
their takeoff is predicated on space for them to land at atl and clt.	non-experiential
i think these carriers should be under the same regs. as the big boys.	unverifiable
"all the proposed customer service requirements  and the five bullet points under ""additional standards dot should be considering, are appropriate."	unverifiable
they should apply to foreign carriers anywhere dot has enforcement jurisdiction.	unverifiable
"baggage delay beyond 2 hours should certainly be long enough to be not delivered on time"", with the proviso that a ""late checkin""  of the bag by the passenger would relieve the airline of that strict deadline."	unverifiable
"a ""significant delay"" under the third bullet point, allowing refund of any type of ticket, should be specified,"	unverifiable
and 3 hours seems reasonable for any flight regardless of duration.	unverifiable
customer service plans and standards should be part of the written contract of carriage,	unverifiable
so passengers have written commitments to compare among different carriers when choosing with whom to fly.	unverifiable
totally in agreement.	unverifiable
online travel agent services like expedia, travelocity or orbitz should be required to show the full cost including all applicable taxes.	unverifiable
the european union already requires that airlines post full prices, including taxes or fees, at the very first presentation of fares.	non-experiential
this is required for flights originating in europe.	non-experiential
american airlines respect this rule when a passenger enters their foreign-based web site,	non-experiential
but airlines do not respect the rule when a passenger books the same flight  from the usa version of the airline's web site.	non-experiential
this can be verified on continental.com by selecting the country  at the top right of the web page and simulating a booking out of a european city.	non-experiential
rule should require us airlines to show full fare regardless of which web site version is used.	unverifiable
prior to the implementation of passenger facility fees in the 1990s, domestic prices did include all taxes, although occasionally certain certain city surcharges were not included.	non-experiential
the industry did just fine.	unverifiable
i have no  problem with a carrier charging a given fare	unverifiable
but they should be honest about what the total cost of the ticket is to the passenger rather than stating a price and putting $30-$50 into  the mix at time of purchase.	unverifiable
if federal excise taxes can be included, there is no reason why other taxes, fees, and surcharges cannot be part of an advertised price.	unverifiable
i wholeheartedly support this proposal.	unverifiable
ideally this would cover international as well as domestic travel as taxes, fees, and surcharges on international tickets frequently add hundreds of dollars to a price quote.	unverifiable
we should all be able to make a reservation without worrying that we missed something and know exactly what we will pay.	unverifiable
i do hope the dot is very strict and across the board with their new regulations.	unverifiable
consumers are being gouged everywhere	unverifiable
and it needs to stop.	unverifiable
i believe this rule should apply to all air carriers.	unverifiable
when you waive it for some you set up a situation which is unfair and opens unforeseen loopholes.	unverifiable
and it should be a legally binding limit.	unverifiable
this is just another regulation that takes basic responsibility out of people's hands.	unverifiable
if you can't do the math to figure out the total cost then you probably should stay home	unverifiable
since you can't figure out the tax on your purchases at stores either.	unverifiable
as long as there is a requirement for a listing of the total cost before they charge you then it is up to the consumer to ask what those other fees are.	unverifiable
the airline companies should be aware of the coming flight delay before boarding.	unverifiable
holding passengers in the plane simply gives them the ability to make more money by re-using the gate for another flight.	non-experiential
they can re-use the gate if the plane is taxied to the wait area and back when flight could proceed, while passengers wait in the waiting area.	unverifiable
i suggest limit the duration of stay onboard to the time required to taxi the plane to a waiting area away from the gates, and back plus, say, half an hour.	unverifiable
that would make it total of hour and a half to two hours maximum.	unverifiable
* although there is no direct formula,	non-experiential
if there are peanut particles in the air, it is highly likely that a passenger with a severe peanut allergy will have a life-threatening reaction.	non-experiential
* complete restriction of peanut products on board a flight is the only way to effectively try to avoid this danger.	non-experiential
this includes food supplied by the airlines, as well as food brought by passengers and consumed on the plane.	non-experiential
* possibly, but you certainly can't bank on it.	unverifiable
epinephrine auto-injectors are designed to temporarily open the air passages;	non-experiential
they are for immediate treatment - not long term treatment.	non-experiential
although epipens might end up staving off a reaction,	non-experiential
they most frequently just buy you some time to get long term treatment at the hospital such as antihistamines, steroids, and other measures.	non-experiential
* that depends.	unverifiable
as parents who have a child with a severe peanut allergy, we don't go anywhere without epipens,	unverifiable
nor should anyone with a severe peanut allergy.	unverifiable
however, the auto-injectors have a large needle at the end of them	non-experiential
it is retracted until the injection is administered,	non-experiential
and i don't know if this is currently a security issue.	unverifiable
if so, and epipens were not allowed to be carried by passengers onto a flight, it would absolutely be up to the airlines to have a stock of them on board as part of their medical supplies.	unverifiable
otherwise, if passengers with proper medical documentation were allowed to carry their prescribed epipens, they should definitely be diligent in doing so,	unverifiable
but i still think epipens should be a standard item included with a plane's medical supplies.	unverifiable
* absolutely.	unverifiable
anything containing peanuts, such as peanut butter crackers, should be restricted, no question.	unverifiable
regarding peanut oils, theoretically, very highly refined peanut oil contains smaller amounts of peanut proteins,	non-experiential
and therefore poses less of a risk.	unverifiable
however, it is almost impossible to determine which food companies use what kinds of oils, how refined the oils are, and what else is involved in the manufacturing process.	unverifiable
so in general, items containing peanut oils should be completely avoided.	unverifiable
look folks, it is simple.	unverifiable
airlines can't afford empty seats on expensive jets burning expensive fuel.	non-experiential
if you increase their costs, they either have to reduce their overbooking or pay the extra fees.	non-experiential
either which way, they will lose more money than they already are losing.	unverifiable
if they don't overbook, there will be more empty seats costing them revenue. higher fares, even higher change ticket fees , airlines going out of business .	unverifiable
in the end, the airlines are not going to pay these fees.	unverifiable
everything flows downhill. period!	unverifiable
the low man on the pole always loses	unverifiable
and make no mistake but the taxpayers and customers are the bottom of the pole.	unverifiable
the rules should be simple.	unverifiable
i've personally never been on a flight where people didn't just volunteer based on the airlines' attempt to bride passengers.	unverifiable
frequentflyer, though i appreciate your attempt at proposed solutions, i cannot support them.	unverifiable
* we live in a remote area	experiential
and air travel is the only option to go anywhere interesting.	experiential
"* ""resue"" medication only lasts 10-20 minutes,"	non-experiential
* and we already take very careful measures to minimize the possibility of exposure.	unverifiable
there's no need to single out passengers if the ban is airline-wide.	unverifiable
there should be written announcements when a ticket is purchased, when a passenger is checked in and a verbal announcement by the flight attendant during the safety spiel at the start of the flight.	unverifiable
in the examples you give, a person can call 911 and get to a hospital within the 30 minute time-frame that 2 epipen doses buy you.	non-experiential
on a plane, especially one going overseas, that is not an option.	non-experiential
very articulate, dadwith4.	unverifiable
"eating peanuts is as much a ""right"" as packing a gun or smoking a cigarette."	unverifiable
"i have no problem requiring the airlines to give notification of any ""known"" delays within 30 minutes of when they become aware of it."	unverifiable
but, being a frequent traveler, i see all sorts of problems which are unavoidable and for which the airlines will be blamed by giving such notice with the intend that some flyers may be able to delay thier trip to the airport or even the departure gate.	unverifiable
i know that many times the airlines can't also know exactly when a weather hold or a maintenance issue will be rectified and that the flight is then ready to go.	non-experiential
many time it can be surprisingly faster than expected.	non-experiential
the problem is that some flyers may then  wait before going to the airport, but then find that the problem was rectified sooner than expected and the flight departed.	unverifiable
they can't have it both ways.	unverifiable
my daughter is allergic to peanut and tree nut.	experiential
the problem with this allergy, is that anaphylaxis can occur from any contact with peanut.	non-experiential
this includes airborne inhalation, cross contamination with other foods, or contact with residue left from previous and nearby passengers.	non-experiential
"it is not simply a matter of ""don't eat it."""	non-experiential
it is well-known that epipens address anaphylaxis on a short term basis.	non-experiential
the effects of the epipen last for 15 or 20 minutes,	non-experiential
but if the medication wears off, the individual can resume their life-threatening reaction.	non-experiential
on the ground, after the use of an epipen, you are supposed to go immediately to the emergency room	non-experiential
because you may need further treatment to save your life.	non-experiential
in the air, you don't have that option.	non-experiential
that is a huge percentage of the population that is at risk by flying in an airplane.	unverifiable
i choose not to fly because of the risk to my daughter,	experiential
but it would be wonderful to be able to travel like everyone else again.	unverifiable
i fully support this ban on any product that contains peanut.	unverifiable
as a former sufferer of a 3-hour ground delay at dca two years ago this summer, i would not will such a delay on anybody.	unverifiable
in this airline's defense, the plane returned to the gate after 2 hours to allow for de-planing,	experiential
banning peanuts and peanut products on flights does not harm anyone and demonstrates the airlines'  reasonable attempt to meet the needs of those with severe peanut allergies.	unverifiable
the airlines can't control what passengers bring onboard,	non-experiential
but they can try to regulate it and not have an entire flight full of people eating peanuts.	non-experiential
an epipen only helps for a few minutes.	non-experiential
i'd rather give up peanuts for a few hours than have a child lose his or her life.	unverifiable
i teach a child with a severe peanut allergy.	unverifiable
i can't 100% prevent individuals from consuming peanut products and coming around the student.	non-experiential
"but, i can ban peanut products in my classroom and post huge signs on my door saying ""do not enter if you have eaten or have been exposed to peanut products""."	non-experiential
that demonstrates my reasonable efforts to protect the student.	unverifiable
full disclosure of all fees should be clearly listed and in language that the average traveler can understand.	unverifiable
most travelers have luggage.	non-experiential
it is reasonable to expect that and it should be part of the usual servicelimited carry-on luggage and one checked bag should be free.	unverifiable
they should not be discriminated against and charged fees for such things.	unverifiable
i carry-on extra food and drink	experiential
bc i experienced being stuck on the tarmac for 6and hours years ago w or o food and drink  before we had cell phones where we could call the police and or or media and make it a new story as they do.	experiential
not to mention, now we are expected to buy lousy airline food onboard,	unverifiable
airlines should meet the needs of their customers and not nickel and dime us to death.	unverifiable
compensation should be reasonable, but at least equal to the travelers' actual monitary losses plus more for inconvenience.	unverifiable
most judges aren't stupid.	unverifiable
i guess i am fortunate	unverifiable
since my symptomology is always similar in nature and covers a four to 12 hour period	experiential
yes, you are fortunate.	unverifiable
for some people  the life-threatening reaction of airway constriction is immediate.	experiential
i couldn't carry enough epi-pens to allow the plane time enough to land	experiential
so that we could get to an er where a doctor--not a nurse--could save his life.	experiential
i'm not an expert like you,	experiential
but last i heard death by suffocation takes a mere 9 minutes.	non-experiential
it would be good business for the airlines to voluntarily do everything they can to avoid re-directing aircraft due to an emergency and ruining everyone's very important trip to cancun.	unverifiable
your concern about religious people requesting further bans on food reveals a lot about you.	unverifiable
my son is not offended by peanuts	experiential
nor do i have a book that says he shouldn't eat them;	experiential
peanuts could kill him.	experiential
it is a scientifically proven fact that anaphylaxis exists and can kill after peanut exposure.	non-experiential
someone above likened this to the boogey man,	non-experiential
but if i give my son a peanut, he could die ;	unverifiable
everytime i look under his bed for the boogey man, there's nothing.	experiential
it's pretty reliable data.	unverifiable
let life and death be the standard for what foods to ban,	unverifiable
i didn't know that there was a sizable peanut lobby,	unverifiable
nor that so many americans tie their rights, freedom, and understanding of capitalism to their ability to eat peanuts.	unverifiable
but i've always known that they love to tie their prejudices to matters they don't understand,	unverifiable
and this board is proof of the reason why the government resorts to making laws that should be common sense and decency.	unverifiable
when a food allergy is life-threatening , it considered a disability under federal laws such as section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and the americans with disabilities act .	non-experiential
in other words, people with severe peanut allergies have the right to be protected.	non-experiential
this seems like another bureaucratic paperwork mess that will be outdated as soon as it is published, of little use and another cost of doing business that will raise ticket prices.	unverifiable
i do not support this.	unverifiable
i long for the day when i can book a flight for my family.	unverifiable
but at the moment, that seems practically impossible	unverifiable
as my 4 year old son has a severe peanut allergy.	experiential
he has reacted in an enclosed room before.	experiential
thankfully, we were on land, not thousands of feet up in the air, making treatment much more feasible.	unverifiable
i am terrified of being on a plane and him coming into contact with peanuts in any way shape or form.	unverifiable
i have contacted airlines to see if a request could be made to keep a flight peanut free, but was advised not to fly with  them instead or to simply stand up on the flight and beg everyone not to eat peanuts during the flight.	experiential
i have chosen not to fly.	experiential
we live 13 hours from our family.	experiential
it is a drive-able distance,	unverifiable
but i would love to be able to spend more time with my family than getting there and back or consider a vacation where driving would not be an option .	unverifiable
at this point, i would have to find childcare for my son	unverifiable
as he could not come with us, or not attend at all.	experiential
my son did not choose this allergy.	experiential
he is dependent upon other people to keep him healthy by preventing him from ingesting or inhaling any peanut product.	experiential
in this way it is a disability.	unverifiable
i remain hopeful the the dot will ban all peanut products on flights and inform all passengers on a flight when a person with such an allergy is on board.	unverifiable
i'd think the simplest answer would be that every plane needs to have an airline employee of decision making level on it.	unverifiable
if they want to get off, then everyone can get off.	unverifiable
so simply restore the captain's authority to do what he feels is in the best interest of the people on his  plane without worrying about a counter-mand from a middle-manager at home in his  hot tub sipping champagne.	unverifiable
if a rule is needed so that it can be empirically decided if someone should be punished, it needs to have a few 'check points'.	unverifiable
after an hour without air conditioning, even a 747 can get pretty warm.	non-experiential
if they want to burn jet fuel to run it, or get an external hookup to run it, that's up to them.	unverifiable
i was once stuck on a flight where the airline couldn't do gate assignments,	experiential
so ground control parked us out of the way,	experiential
and the captain sat there and burned jet fuel to run the ac until the company decided to figure it out.	experiential
the wait was annoying,	unverifiable
but listening to atc on channel 9 of the in flight entertainment was very entertaining.	unverifiable
two hours is far too long to expect an adult to 'hold it',	unverifiable
so working restrooms need to be provided by then.	unverifiable
food and water needs to be determined by the length of the flight.	unverifiable
if it's 30 minutes, and no meal service was planned, than a meal service needs to be performed at 30 minutes.	unverifiable
if a meal service was planned, then the meal service needs to be performed on time, even if the flight is still on the ground.	unverifiable
people have medical conditions that require regular intake of food.	non-experiential
3 hours is about time to give it up entirely.	unverifiable
"either cancel the flight, or do a ""please ring your call bell if you wish to return to the gate. be aware that you may not be able to reboard this flight if it takes off without you."""	unverifiable
again, i'd hope the captain knows how to manage his  plane.	unverifiable
they get one 'pass' on any of these limits, but no more than 30 minutes.	unverifiable
if the guy at the front of the plane is making poor judgement calls about food, water, and bathroom service, than you've got far more problems than a full bladder.	unverifiable
should they ban dust on airplanes,	unverifiable
they'd have to shut down air travel,	unverifiable
since they wouldn't be able to allow the doors to be opened for passengers to embark or disembark due to the dust on their clothes and luggage, in the jetway, and outside the plane.	non-experiential
sometimes the only way to fight back against the ridiculous is to propose something even more ridiculous.	unverifiable
did you read a news story about the one person in the history of the world who actually had said allergy	unverifiable
munchasen by proxy - look it up.	unverifiable
mulder is right on point.	unverifiable
most food allergies are completely imagined.	unverifiable
an overly anxious parent gets it in her head that little jimmy might have had a hive after someone had peanuts in his vicinity,	experiential
"and now he's ""deathly allergic""."	experiential
i sincerely doubt it.	unverifiable
peanuts are incredibly nutritious,	unverifiable
and quite filling in a small serving.	unverifiable
simply put, pound for pound there is no better food on the planet.	unverifiable
this whole anti-peanut hysteria is ridiculous!	unverifiable
leave my peanuts alone!	unverifiable
if you are one of the incredibly rare people that have an actual medically diagnosed severe allergy to this wonderful food, then you better never leave the house	unverifiable
because peanuts are everywhere.	non-experiential
you certainly should not be flying.	unverifiable
unless you choke on them, these things  will not kill anyone.	non-experiential
go to a real doctor and get tested -	unverifiable
he will tell you peanuts are harmless.	unverifiable
while i am sure it was scary,	unverifiable
you said it yourself,	non-experiential
the reaction was not severe.	unverifiable
i applaud the flight attendant for singling you out -	unverifiable
as a fellow traveller i would want to know who had caused my child to not be able to have a snack on a long flight.	unverifiable
peanuts are harmless to 99.9999999% of the population.	non-experiential
the traveling public should not be impacted because of your erroneous belief that this wonderful food might harm your child.	unverifiable
airlines are not public establishments;	non-experiential
they are private enterprise.	non-experiential
since nearly everyone has an allergy to something: chocolate, dairy, dust, pollen, etc.	non-experiential
there's no double standard at all.	unverifiable
you and many others cling to worst-case scenario thinking;	unverifiable
whereby you imagine the worst possible outcome and act as  if it's a certainty.	unverifiable
nothing could be more delusional than that.	unverifiable
no deaths due to anaphylactic shock caused by exposure to peanuts on-board an airliner have been reported in this country,	non-experiential
so the possibility that it would happen remains infinitesimally small,	non-experiential
though you would rather have everyone believe it's certain to happen if peanuts are served by airlines.	unverifiable
facts are stubborn things,	unverifiable
and the fact is that you're more likely to be hit and killed by a car on any given day,	non-experiential
but neither you nor anyone else is advocating that we ban automobiles or driving.	unverifiable
allergies to peanuts or tree nuts are not increasing;	non-experiential
there is no scientific data to support such claims.	non-experiential
the latest data we have for deaths from anaphylactic shock is 14 people in one year,	non-experiential
far more people die in swimming pools every year.	non-experiential
contrary to your claim, exposure to peanuts is not more likely to cause anaphylactic shock;	non-experiential
it may cause that reaction in the worst sufferers.	non-experiential
people with that condition know it and need to take responsibility for their condition when traveling by any means, including medication to prevent or reduce the severity of any reaction, face masks, and epi-pens.	unverifiable
if they won't do that, then they deserve whatever consequences come from their own negligence.	unverifiable
it is not society's responsibility to be burdened with their condition.	unverifiable
since peanut dust, oils, and parts are already embedded in the aircraft, even though you can't see it.	non-experiential
mulder, once again you are absolutely correct.	unverifiable
all the hyper-emotional arguments aside, the simple fact is,	unverifiable
not one person has ever died from a peanut on an airplane!!!	non-experiential
for that matter you shouldn't drive, walk in public, eat any kind of food, or breath the air,	unverifiable
as each of these activities has a higher chance of injuring someone than ingesting a peanut.	non-experiential
this is not some 'hyper-libertarian' matter of principle.	unverifiable
we should probably all submit to being anesthetized so that no one becomes unruly in transit.	unverifiable
well, its time to make a stand now.	unverifiable
just say no to foolish regulation and supposed risk avoidance.	unverifiable
life is a risk.	unverifiable
the biggest risk is that of getting old and finding that you never really lived.	unverifiable
most food allergies are bunk.	unverifiable
peanuts do not kill anyone.	non-experiential
don't try to tell me what i can and cannot eat.	unverifiable
mulder, i like peanuts,	unverifiable
i don't think they need to.	unverifiable
plenty of times i'm not thrilled with what i am offered	unverifiable
but i don't think passengers should be banned from bringing peanut products on the flight.	unverifiable
there's a compromise that can be struck.	unverifiable
so i usually bring my own.	unverifiable
there are some standards that people should abide by while flying on a plane.	unverifiable
however, that is not the issue at hand-- peanuts on the plane are.	unverifiable
while i don't always enjoy peanuts while flying, i don't believe they should be banned outright.	unverifiable
i think that people who suffer from severe peanut allergies should seriously consider the possibility of peanuts being aboard planes, and should carry the appropriate medications should they be affected by an allergy.	unverifiable
"if the airlines want to regulate this, i believe that creating a few dedicated planes to serve as ""peanut-free"" flying experiences are an acceptable alternative to completely banning peanuts and peanut products on planes."	unverifiable
it is not the responsibility of the government, however, to regulate the presence or absence of foods on planes.	unverifiable
we have bigger issues for the government to handle, such as the aforementioned air safety issues of bringing incendiary devices on planes.	unverifiable
your argument is a strawman.	unverifiable
nobody is advocating funerals;	unverifiable
you're just trying to deflect attention away from the issue, which is that there is no real risk to peanut allergy sufferers.	unverifiable
and there is no scientific evidence to support your argument.	non-experiential
you can't even cite the studies you claim exist,	non-experiential
because they don't exist.	non-experiential
the only mean spirited people are those like yourself, who want to trample the rights of the majority for a non-existent risk that affects a very small number of people.	unverifiable
this has nothing to do with the founding of the u.s. at all.	unverifiable
that's a myth that you need to stop clinging to in order to rationalize your desire for a ban on nuts.	unverifiable
it's a tired, old excuse, but it doesn't work.	unverifiable
so jetblue serves chips.	non-experiential
whichever it is, people are allergic to both, so that means you can't serve that as a snack to some people, too.	unverifiable
and down the slippery slope we go.	unverifiable
good luck with that.	unverifiable
this is not a matter of itchy eyes or a runny nose.	unverifiable
this is a matter of the airway closing down , or the entire body going into anaphylactic shock.	unverifiable
it causes death.	non-experiential
i have such an allergy, but to chewing gum and rubber.	experiential
i almost died twice.	unverifiable
minors and elderly that can not take care of themselves should not fly alone.	unverifiable
airlines are not babysitters.	unverifiable
i have always considered that to be negligence on the parents.	unverifiable
sending your minor child on a plane  across the country, or across the world alone, who knows what could happen.	unverifiable
"these are the same ""parents"" that drive up and drop their child off at a mall for the day, then wonder why they get a call from the police that their child was found dead in a ditch."	unverifiable
you left your minor child unattended.	unverifiable
be a real parent.	unverifiable
that's the problem with regulations like this.	unverifiable
there are so many reasons why a flight might be delayed	non-experiential
and each of them has a great variance in how long it may take to resolve that issuing a blanket rule would cause as many problems as it solves.	unverifiable
i have no problem with airlines developing their own policies vice a mandated government requirement	unverifiable
"but whatever those policies are they need to be easy to find, easy to read and understandable by your ""average"" person before someone books and pays for a flight."	unverifiable
this is exactly my point regarding emotional reasoning and also the idea that one individuals comfort is more important than anothers.	unverifiable
in your zeal to ridicule you may have missed the point of alternatives and discussion which i thought was why we were here.	unverifiable
perhaps i was wrong to thing that was what we were suppossed to be doing.	unverifiable
also, you assume the child will scream.	unverifiable
i would say that perhaps you should help the child become accustomed to the mask before hand by making it a game.	unverifiable
this has worked with other things that children must endure.	unverifiable
secondly you reject the notion outright and my guess is that you have never tried it.	unverifiable
this also proves that your concern is more with what you want and not what might work.	unverifiable
"your reasoning backs us ""the collective us"" into a corner of take it or leave it."	unverifiable
i am sorry that offering other ideas instead of your preferred ban on peanuts upsets you.	unverifiable
i refer you again to emotional reasoning on that.	unverifiable
dwein003 - the problem is when i pull out a clif bar to eat as a snack, or a pbj sandwich i made at home, or a turkey sandwich on oatnut bread, or a snickers bar...	unverifiable
this is where the holes in the plan becomes apparent.	unverifiable
eliminating bags of peanuts is not the issue - that's easy.	unverifiable
because to truly eliminate any potential for airborne peanut , passengers would not be able to bring any food on-board,	unverifiable
because even home-made sandwiches could contain nuts.	non-experiential
and personally, i don't think you can go that far.	unverifiable
and so far on this comment board, no one has been able to address that issue.	unverifiable
a blanket restriction can be communicated as part of the ticket purchase, much like the new luggage fees.	unverifiable
i would suggest asking airlines to print it on the itinerary with food information, and on boarding passes.	unverifiable
as i think about it, there are some serious communication issues with peanut-free zones or individual peanut-free flights.	unverifiable
i caught the time change when i logged in to print a boarding pass.	experiential
my brother almost missed a flight when the same thing happened to him.	experiential
if a peanut-allergic person books a flight a short time before travel, the airlines are not reliable enough to notify passengers.	unverifiable
the information could be provided when people log in to print boarding passes,	non-experiential
the scenario where a celiac like me packs peanut-containing food and doesn't find out about a peanut restriction until they arrive at the airport is troublesome.	unverifiable
not all terminals have places where i can buy gluten-free food.	non-experiential
peanut-free zones on full flights could be handled by the flight staff moving people who want to eat peanuts around the cabin;	unverifiable
however, people are sometimes resistant to being reseated and it puts a burden on the flight crew.	unverifiable
as i write this, i think dot is going to have to go with an all or none policy on peanuts.	unverifiable
"it's too difficult to communicate to other passengers with different dietary restrictions who might pack peanuts with a ""sometimes"" policy."	unverifiable
yes, there should be a uniform federal time limit on tarmac delay.	unverifiable
"this should apply to all planes that take off or land from us airports: all us flights, foreign flights, and even ""flyover"" planes that make an emergency landing."	unverifiable
it should apply even to flights of fewer than 30 passengers.	unverifiable
to me, having contingency plans is not as important as a strong penalty for delaying passengers;	unverifiable
i think that is enough of an incentive or deterrent.	unverifiable
i strongly support plans that would allow delayed international passengers to deplane when the delay is sufficiently long.	unverifiable
my husband and i have always been big air travelers.	experiential
3 yrs ago we found out that my son  had a peanut allergy.	experiential
"after blood tests confirmed the allergy, we took steps to make air travel ""safer""."	unverifiable
some flights were still taken without many problems	unverifiable
while others were the cause of us no longer flying together as a family or taking cross country trips.	experiential
"another commenter mentioned how swa gave them a ""peanut free"" flight after they told people they had an allergy."	non-experiential
while this is a nice idea,	unverifiable
it's not really possible.	unverifiable
even if peanuts aren't served on that flight, they have been served on that plane already.	non-experiential
after telling 3 different people that our child was severely allergic, the ground 'near' us had peanuts all over it and sent my son into an asthmatic reaction.	unverifiable
thankfully he did not at the time go into full anaphylactic shock,	experiential
but since then his iga levels in his blood have continued to go up.	experiential
this means it is very likely that he would have a more severe reaction to exposure the next time.	unverifiable
we stopped flying about a year and a half ago.	experiential
i think it is reasonable to say that if the food you are eating in an enclosed space with recycled air is going to kill a child, you can fore-go eating it for a few hours.	unverifiable
"and as for the argument of ""perfume"" being comparable, which if actually researched is very  different, i do fore-go wearing perfumes on flights as well for that reason."	unverifiable
not a big deal to skip on it so the person near  me can breath.	unverifiable
i just want to be able to take my family on airplanes without fearing for my child's life.	unverifiable
mr. aldrich:  please read the earlier posts on this topic.	unverifiable
so i would hope that, if faced with a situation, you would show others that you can be a considerate person .	unverifiable
on a plane 2 years ago, when my son was 3, he came into contact the carpeting below the seat and developed hives.	experiential
we looked and saw an old peanut under the seat in front of us.	experiential
he has a documented peanut allergy.	experiential
i suspect that there was residual peanut in the carpet that he came into contact with.	non-experiential
i am fairly certain that this 3 year-old boy he did not get hives because he was 'stressed out'.	experiential
fortunately all he got was hives,	non-experiential
but as best we could tell he did not have a serious ingestion	unverifiable
and our leg of the flight was peanut-free after we had notified the airline of his allergy at booking and check-in.	experiential
so, while it is possible to have an ige-mediated reaction solely from emotional stress,	non-experiential
this was not the case here.	unverifiable
my family would very much welcome an outright ban on airlines serving peanuts and peanut products.	unverifiable
our 3-year old daughter experiences anaphylactic reactions to several foods, including peanuts.	experiential
peanuts are the only one of her food allergies that seems to elicit a response, even if she has not ingested or touched it.	experiential
for example, she's had reactions after coming in close contact with boxed peanut cookies at the grocery store and when playing in the front yard with some neighbor's kids.	experiential
during these episodes, we've been able to give her an antihistamine, her inhaler,	experiential
and if required, we'll follow this with a trip to the er where they administer a steroid.	unverifiable
we stopped flying	experiential
because there is not such a third option.	unverifiable
one set of grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousins live on the opposite coast	experiential
and we have stopped traveling to visit them.	experiential
since our daughter was diagnosed with this peanut allergy,	experiential
we can still control much of her environment to ensure her physical safety	unverifiable
but being on an airplane with peanuts is beyond our control.	non-experiential
we have chosen not to endanger her life.	unverifiable
we notified the airline in advance as we have for every other flight.	experiential
i do travel prepared for emergencies, knowing that an epi pen will only work for a short period but carrying it nontheless.	unverifiable
the airline we were on, delta, announced early in 2010 that they would no longer be serving peanuts,	non-experiential
which is why we chose this airline.	unverifiable
first flight, no problem, serving pretzels or cookies.	experiential
return flight, as the attendants were approaching our aisle, i thought i was smelling peanuts.	unverifiable
i asked	experiential
and yes indeedy, they were serving peanuts.	experiential
ddn't know she was onboard,	experiential
and gee they're sorry	unverifiable
they quickly gave us a 3 aisle buffer zone,	unverifiable
always nice to have people make angry comments aimed at a child.	unverifiable
which totally made the other passengers angry	unverifiable
as they wanted the same peanuts the other passengers a row or two ahead of them had gotten.	unverifiable
yes my daughter felt terrible and was very embarrassed,	unverifiable
and i was angry that she had put in a situation that embarrassed her	unverifiable
and, more importantly, i was angry that her health was in danger.	unverifiable
the buffer zones, even when implemented in advance of food service simply can not work.	unverifiable
peanuts have oil	non-experiential
and that oil gets on the hands of every single person eating them.	non-experiential
the oil is then transferred onto every single surface of the airplane,	non-experiential
and we all know that no cursory cleaning will take care of it.	non-experiential
"even if she is in a ""clean zone"", the previous 1000 flights have so contaminated the plane that it is not safe for her."	non-experiential
any surface that is touched by a peanut eating person is deadly to my daughter.	non-experiential
fortunately for us, she does not have  a severe airborne allergy,	experiential
or the smell of the forward cabin's 100 passenger's munching on peanuts would have killed her!	unverifiable
this seems like a no brainer!	unverifiable
we boarded a plane toward the end of the boarding call	experiential
we were running and planning to use the bathroom on the plane	unverifiable
cause we didn't have time to stop.	experiential
we were not told that the 1 bathroom on the plane was not working.	experiential
i had to sit on that plane from az to ca and almost wet the seat.	unverifiable
a plane should be required to have working facilities or ground it.	unverifiable
i also think it is just as bad to be stuck on tarmac in small plane as large.	unverifiable
there is no air	non-experiential
and i have anxiety and start feeling really hot if there is no air conditioning and have to wait with all the people breathing in there it gets worse and worse.	unverifiable
2 hours maximum on the tarmac is enough.	unverifiable
deboard plane and let people get off.	unverifiable
we are not cattle or sheep to be herded up in a pen .	unverifiable
it is inhuman.	unverifiable
my son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air.	unverifiable
we had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist.	experiential
the airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks.	experiential
my son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip.	experiential
since he didn't eat any peanuts,	experiential
we were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country.	unverifiable
we suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight.	experiential
we may not be so lucky next time	unverifiable
because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last.	non-experiential
even though we were on a peanut-free fight,	experiential
my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight.	unverifiable
if peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe.	unverifiable
when an allergic reaction occurs high up in the sky over a huge ocean, and an epi-pen injection can only give a person an extra 20 minutes, there is not enough time to turn the plane around and take the person to the hospital.	non-experiential
i believe that it is reasonable to ban peanuts from airline flights if that assures the safety of a passenger that has a severe peanut allergy.	unverifiable
this decision could mean life or death for someone.	non-experiential
thank you for your thoughtful consideration to ban peanuts from flights.	unverifiable
with all of the other travel sites  out there, i would imagine that if there was such a high demand for people to see full prices with bags and other fees, these sites would have created something to compensate for it.	unverifiable
"they would offer some sort of system where you could maybe ""check off"" boxes for what you want included, along with the options like dates or times, prefer nonstop, flexibility, etc."	unverifiable
these sites would then offer the lowest fare based on your preferences per airline.	unverifiable
however, since these sites aren't providing those options,	non-experiential
there is no scientific evidence showing that peanut allergies are increasing.	non-experiential
self-reporting studies are inherently flawed and cannot be used for that very purpose.	unverifiable
uninformed parents think every adverse reaction to some food must be an allergy,	unverifiable
and they don't bother to have their children tested to find out.	unverifiable
without there being a unified standard for allergy testing and diagnosis, any studies will be irrelevant and nothing more than a source of debate among the scientific community.	unverifiable
i certainly won't ante up my peanut allergic child as sacrificial proof that banning peanuts on flights is a simpler solution than emergency landings and potential funerals.	unverifiable
there are two main factions here: those who believe that it is right to help the few to live life to the fullest of their abilities, and those who believe that no-one has the right to pass laws they do not agree with .	unverifiable
and it is very obvious that a consensus will not be agreed upon here.	unverifiable
no doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.	unverifiable
those who have legitimate life threatening allergies  have a right to be heard.	unverifiable
unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.	unverifiable
congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations.	unverifiable
i understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say,	unverifiable
but money should not outweigh logic and science.	unverifiable
i would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights.	unverifiable
my granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items.	experiential
and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured.	unverifiable
unfortunately, the science is not there yet.	unverifiable
"so, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications."	unverifiable
we accept these as our responsibility.	unverifiable
we are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a delta hub.	unverifiable
this does not affect one person, this affects 12!	unverifiable
i would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar,	unverifiable
but delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in georgia!	unverifiable
the negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.	unverifiable
get the feedback from the experts, make logical decisions, and fund the research into finding cures or relief for those suffering from the disability of life threatening allergies.	unverifiable
all life threatening allergies!	unverifiable
but please do not wait until someone dies before acting.	unverifiable
there are several institutions researching peanut allergies.	non-experiential
duke university medical center, national jewish medical and research center in denver, mount sinai school of medicine, and the johns hopkins university medical center all have prominent, reputable, knowledgeable experts in this field studying this problem.	non-experiential
i doubt any immunologist or allergy specialist will provide a universal radius for the dot to establish a peanut-free zone on an aircraft.	unverifiable
a single person can have varied reactions from being exposed to the same amount of the same allergen on different days.	non-experiential
now factor in every other peanut allergy sufferer in the country and you have yourself a multivariate problem of the grandest magnitude.	unverifiable
i realize this scientific data is the key to removing the congressionally-imposed funding restrictions,	unverifiable
but it seems like common sense should prevail on issues of passenger safety and the study should simply be a formality.	unverifiable
removing peanuts and peanut products from aircraft will significantly reduce the probability of an anaphylactic reaction in-flight the same way routine aircraft maintenance significantly reduces the probability of aircraft failures.	unverifiable
regarding peanut free flights, southwest airlines has been the most accommodating in our experience.	unverifiable
we try to take the first flight of the day to minimize peanut residue and crumbs that are found with greater frequency as the day wears on.	unverifiable
with this self-imposed protocol in place, my 4-year old daughter has avoided severe reactions from exposure to a peanut allergen on an aircraft,	unverifiable
although she does spend most of the flight sneezing, scratching, and rubbing her eyes while we're on the edge of our seat looking for signs of a stronger reaction.	experiential
there is not a person on this planet that will die because they did not receive a peanut snack on their flight.	non-experiential
there are millions of people  who could die due to some form of exposure to a peanut allergen on their flight.	non-experiential
this is a no-brainer...	unverifiable
take the darn peanuts off of the planse.	unverifiable
i have a similar problem with errors on your website with macos safari before it is published.	unverifiable
once the plane has left the gate as long as it's officially waiting for take-off, then it appears to me passengers should not be allowed to leave the gate.	unverifiable
"however, i remember times while traveling thru denver, united would leave the gate, then taxi to the ""penalty box"" waiting for clearances and take off instructions."	experiential
airlines should not be allowed to leave the gate unless there is a expected takeoff time issued by faa atc clearance delivery and ground control.	unverifiable
if the expected departure time issued by faa atc is over 3 hours then the aircraft should not be allowed to leave the gate.	unverifiable
however, if an airline has left the gate, and the departure time is extended while waiting for take-off,  where the total time is greater than three hours on the ground then the airport and airline should get buses out to the aircraft for any passengers that want to deplane.	unverifiable
as you can see there are mitigating circumstances affecting the airline and aircraft	unverifiable
these organizations include the airport authority, the faa atc ground control and clearance delivery control, and airline pilots.	non-experiential
too often fees are hidden until payment is made.	unverifiable
and options are not offered to delete those fees.	non-experiential
unbundled fares doesn't give airlines the right to deceptively advertise costs.	unverifiable
all costs should be disclosed in an a la carte menu upfront!	unverifiable
airlines need to have a standard on oversize baggage.	unverifiable
that price should be prominently listed and easily accessible so the consumer can discern the total price of flying with oversized baggage.	unverifiable
for example surfboards can be charged twice as much as golf clubs.	unverifiable
you raise a point which underscores the reasons why such bans are inappropriate.	unverifiable
people who have such conditions  have the ultimate responsibility to themselves to determine risks to their unusual sensitivities,	unverifiable
"your ""disability"" does not give you the right to infringe indiscriminately upon others."	unverifiable
"too often people seem to think they are ""special"" and deserve more consideration and privilege than the ""normal"" masses."	unverifiable
your rights end where mine begin.	unverifiable
you do not have the right to keep me off a flight because i have a cat and its dander may be on my clothing, due to your rare sensitivity.	unverifiable
you should make whatever travel arrangements are necessary to accommodate your unusual needs.	unverifiable
you do not have the right to keep me off a flight because i had peanuts for lunch and their dust may be on my clothing, because you have a rare allergy.	unverifiable
you should make whatever travel arrangements are necessary to accommodate your unusual needs.	unverifiable
if we start down this road eventually we will all have to fly naked, freshly showered, and hungry.	unverifiable
give me a break.	unverifiable
your needs are your responsibility.	unverifiable
the dot should allow airlines to voluntarily accommodate if they so choose , but not require any bans.	unverifiable
you realize, though, that this is a risk that you take when you travel in an airplane.	unverifiable
there are risks associated with every type of travel,	unverifiable
and lost or delayed luggage is a risk associated with flying.	unverifiable
while it's extremely inconvenient to be without luggage,	unverifiable
it would be unrealistic to expect that luggage will always be on time,	unverifiable
just as it would be unrealistic to expect always to avoid the risk of traffic when deciding to drive.	unverifiable
when you choose to fly, you also choose to adopt the risks of flying, from loss of life to loss of luggage.	non-experiential
speaking of ups, they are now offering a new service to customers:	non-experiential
they will ship your luggage,	non-experiential
so you can mail it ahead of time or avoid the risk of losing your luggage in transit.	non-experiential
i think it's interesting that solutions to this problem are coming from outside of the airlines themselves.	unverifiable
here's a link to that story:	non-experiential
actually, there are over 50 us air carriers to choose from,	non-experiential
so although the airline industry is not perfectly competitive,	unverifiable
it certainly is not monopolistic.	unverifiable
since the end of the cab  air travel has become much more competitive and fares have dropped dramatically.	non-experiential
according to the gao, fares fell by 30%  between 1976 and 1990 because of deregulation, and have fallen another 25% since 1991.	non-experiential
here's an interesting article about the lower costs and greater availability of air travel due to airline deregulation:	non-experiential
the dot got the idea of flight notifications from the airlines themselves,	non-experiential
so i wouldn't be so quick to discount the incentive that customer satisfaction plays to airlines.	unverifiable
any business which intends to survive has to satisfy its customers,	unverifiable
otherwise the customers will simply stop buying their product,	unverifiable
and the business will go bankrupt.	unverifiable
airlines themselves already thought up flight status notifications	non-experiential
because there was customer demand for them.	non-experiential
i find it interesting that you claim neither passengers nor profits to be benefiting from the current state of air transit affairs.	unverifiable
airlines like southwest are benefiting	unverifiable
exactly because they are offering low fares, serving their customer needs,	unverifiable
which would seem to disprove your statement that both profits and passengers suffer in the status quo.	unverifiable
here is an incentive:	unverifiable
if a customer is dissatisfied with flight notifications, they ought to take their business elsewhere.	unverifiable
no one dies  of a lack of peanuts	non-experiential
but people can and do die of peanut allergies.	non-experiential
i live in hawaii where a 6 hour flight is required to go anywhere.	experiential
mom didn't have any obvious peanut butter on her.	unverifiable
epipens buy you 15 minutes.	non-experiential
please ban peanuts altogether.	unverifiable
airlines should require a gate agent to give hourly status or tell passengers when to return to the gate for status.	unverifiable
we were scheduled for an 8am departure.	experiential
gate personnel advised us of mechanical problems and said to check back at 10am.	experiential
at 9am, a gate agent advised maybe a 11am boarding	experiential
after that no one gave us status.	experiential
it was 6pm before we found out the flight was canceled by calling the airlines.	experiential
"the notice on the departure boards and at the gate said ""delayed""..."	experiential
a gate agent never gave us status after 9am!	experiential
a fellow passenger happened to work at this airline,	experiential
so he made some calls and was able to get status from the maintenance crew...	experiential
the maintenance chief said his estimated time of fix was 5pm - maybe.	experiential
"if some ""official"" from the airline had done the same thing, the passengers could have done something else for those many hours rather than hang around the airport, checking the departures board for status."	unverifiable
also no compensation given...	experiential
but that's another discussion.	unverifiable
no, it would not have changed the delay or cancellation situation,	unverifiable
but if an agent had said check back in x number of hours, then actually come to the gate at that time, people could have done something else.	non-experiential
i've worked in customer service before.	experiential
"customers want to know what's happening if only to be told ""this is the problem, we're still working on it..."""	unverifiable
i agree with the proposed solutions.	unverifiable
let's keep in mind that a bumped passenger may miss a cruise ship departure, miss a connecting flight, lose a day  of a prepaid vacation, or miss a wedding or funeral	unverifiable
because the airline was greedy and didn't want even one empty seat on their flight.	unverifiable
if being bumped from a flight caused additional problems for the bumped passenger then the passenger should be able to submit proof of loss and the airline should have to compensate without limit in addition to the proposed penalties.	unverifiable
i also like the idea of pre notification of bumping.	unverifiable
it can cost well over $100 to get to an airport	non-experiential
for example, central nj to jfk is about $150	non-experiential
and for a long vacation this is cheaper than airport parking.	non-experiential
when a passenger is bumped and the next available flight is the next day this can mean an additional $300and in travel costs.	non-experiential
most airlines have forgotten that the customer is there for their sake, not the other way around,	unverifiable
hence service plans should be explicit and fair.	unverifiable
i am highly allergic to cats, and somewhat allergic to dogs.	experiential
i have stopped flying since pets have been allowed in the cabin.	experiential
i was part of a johns hopkins cat allergy study	experiential
because i have severe asthma attacks in the presence of cats.	experiential
they tested me by putting me in a room with caged cats.	experiential
i am able to be in the presence of a cat owner	experiential
because they don't usually jump around spreading dander from their clothing.	experiential
i just have to refrain from hugging them.	experiential
i'm not likely to hug a fellow passenger.	unverifiable
i made the mistake of sitting in a front seat on a sw flight to california from maryland, last november.	experiential
i went through 2 bags of cough drops	experiential
because the tickle in my throat would not stop.	experiential
once i left the plane, the irritation ceased.	unverifiable
i saw on my return flight that a service dog was sitting in the seat i had been in on the way out.	experiential
that must be why i reacted.	experiential
i then sat in a seat farther back.	experiential
that would work out if service dogs were all that was allowed.	unverifiable
i cannot leave the plane at 30,000 feet in the air.	non-experiential
i usually take my inhaler and leave the area of contamination.	unverifiable
i was on those flights	experiential
because i did not realize there had been a change in sw policy.	unverifiable
i was in line to board the plane	experiential
before i realized there had been a change.	unverifiable
the return trip was also booked and paid for.	experiential
i do not know why people are upset about pets not being allowed in the cabin.	unverifiable
it's just been recently that this has been allowed.	non-experiential
i now travel cross country by car and call ahead to be sure that the hotel room does not allow pets.	experiential
that's getting harder to find now, too.	non-experiential
the peanut allergy people are even in a worse position than i am.	unverifiable
their sensitivity is even more acute.	unverifiable
i fail to understand why so many people are so selfish that they cannot give up peanuts for a few hours.	unverifiable
i understand that they do air condition those compartments when pets are in them.	non-experiential
for those who require a protein snack. i remember sw used to give snacks that had little sausages and cheese packets in them.	non-experiential
i know that even lactose intolerant people would be able to eat the sausage and maybe even the cheese .	non-experiential
i know that people allergic to dairy do not react to touching something a cheese eater has touched.	non-experiential
they must consume the product.	non-experiential
it is documented that there are a large number of people allergic to cats and dogs and a pretty good number of people allergic to peanuts.	non-experiential
i do not think that fear of red hair is a documented problem large enough to be considered.	unverifiable
i noticed perfume was also mentioned.	experiential
my husband and i are also sensitive to perfumes	unverifiable
but we haven't really had a problem with overly scented passengers.	unverifiable
we already are limited in what we can bring in our carryons.	non-experiential
i think those are the major problems for allergies.	unverifiable
maybe just looking at peanut allergies is too narrow.	unverifiable
canada's lung association is currently fighting the concept of pets being allowed in canadian airline cabins.	non-experiential
i think we need to take a look at what's happening there.	unverifiable
as to the cost and benefit analysis projections prepared by dot, it would seem to be the shorter the tarmac delay time, analogous to a ship idled in port, the likelihood of saving money would be greater with a shorter delay time to return to the gate.	unverifiable
this would seem to make the greater economic sense.	unverifiable
"it should be self evident based upon ""running"" time cost in a queue compared to cost of delay to determine a break even point."	unverifiable
while this approach might cause inconvenience to some passengers,	unverifiable
it become a sum zero game when measured against waiting time on the tarmac, with all the fuss that that generates.	unverifiable
i need to use the toilet often and need to drink lots of water for the medication that i'm on.	experiential
before i board a flight, i take care of these things	experiential
but if we sit on the tarmac for a long time, i'm in big trouble!	unverifiable
"i have consistently had the problem where i selected a flight, and clicked the ""select"" button, only to be told that the price had suddenly risen by hundreds of dollars."	experiential
"it's the old ""bait and switch""."	unverifiable
when i cancel and start over again, i see the same thing: a low-ball offer, with a much higher price when i try to buy the ticket.	experiential
if the flight sells out while i'm deciding then fine,	unverifiable
no bait and switch while you're online.	unverifiable
all the talk about baggage has been focusing on the fees and on what problems flight attendants claim it causes because more people are carrying on more.	non-experiential
these baggage issues came up during the house transportation committee's hearing last week.	non-experiential
while i don't like the baggage fees,	unverifiable
as a fairly frequent traveler for business, the main reason i do not check my luggage has nothing to do with baggage fees.	unverifiable
i do not check my luggage because of all the time it takes.	experiential
when you travel regularly, adding an extra hour plus to each direction of each trip is alot of time that can be much better spent elsewhere and on other things.	unverifiable
the baggage handling process at some airports is incredibly slow	non-experiential
"a note on fees - the idea of charging extra for both checked and carry-on luggage as an ""extra"" or optional service that can be unbundled is ridiculous."	unverifiable
virtually no one can travel without either a checked bag or a carry-on.	non-experiential
even business people who travel somewhere in the morning and back the same night tend to bring a briefcase or similar.	unverifiable
if virtually everyone would have to pay the fee, then it is not optional and should be part of the ticket price.	unverifiable
the rules should be standard	unverifiable
and they should be specific	unverifiable
and they should apply to all commercial airlines in american air space	unverifiable
and there should be significant and mandatory fines imposed for violation of the rules just like there are for aircraft safety .	unverifiable
if the rule is not specific and does not apply to all the airlines will find ways to avoid it.	unverifiable
the additional standards mentioned should be included.	unverifiable
i urge strong consideration of a complete ban on peanuts during all domestic flights.	unverifiable
due to severe peanut allergy, i can now only fly on flights that ban peanuts completely.	experiential
i live in minnesota	experiential
where delta recently purchased northwest airlines	non-experiential
northwest was peanut-free.	non-experiential
nor does such a zone protect from peanut residue left behind from previous flights.	non-experiential
it seems illogical to serve a highly allergy-inducing product on airliners at 30,000 feet when unlimited other snack options exist.	unverifiable
i can only surmise that a strong lobby effort and financial incentives have kept peanuts on airplanes, to the peril of allergic individuals  and the liability of the carriers.	non-experiential
all travel websites along with the airline websites need to be held accountable to these rules.	unverifiable
leg room needs to be standardized throughout the industry.	unverifiable
then a consumer can make a more informed choice of whether or not to pay extra for additional leg room.	unverifiable
"i recommend the industry adopt a 33"" pitch throughout economy seating."	unverifiable
"increased fees after a ticket has been purchased is nothing short of ""bait and switch"""	unverifiable
which i believe the federal government has declared illegal and prosecutable when businesses attempt to engage in such practices.	non-experiential
airlines need to be held to account like any other business entity.	unverifiable
i do not see why airlines should be immune to this by dot's proposals.	unverifiable
if all fees and taxes, actual cost of ticket, opt-in extras for baggage and additional leg room would certainly aid me in comparing prices between airlines and allow me a more informed choice.	unverifiable
my main problem is with the form of compensation.	unverifiable
the last thing i want is a voucher, with numerous restrictions and an expiration date, from an airline i may never want to fly with again.	unverifiable
i have received several of these over the years and have never used any of them.	experiential
the dot should require that debit cards be issued on the spot for the compensatory amount or perhaps an unrestricted voucher that any airline must accept	unverifiable
and let the airlines work out amongst themselves how they will compensate each other.	unverifiable
although i understand the seriousness of the issue for those with severe reactions	unverifiable
i think an outright ban would be the only effective way to reduce the danger.	unverifiable
however, you will not be able to prevent individual travelers from purchasing and transporting their own stash.	unverifiable
i have been flying internationally and domestically for 59 years	experiential
and never encountered an incidence of an allergic reaction on any flight.	experiential
i feel that any individual with such a severe reaction needs to take the necessary precautions personally and not ask the airline to provide them.	unverifiable
the information and technology is available	non-experiential
so i don't find it burdensome for an airline , or for the dot themselves to accumulate and present the info in a useable fashion for interested travelers.	unverifiable
i see no issue with baggage fees.	unverifiable
i have an issue with what ryanair is doing or trying to do and that is charging for bathroom use.	unverifiable
airlines need to make a profit...	non-experiential
but the whole system is full costs that are not fully realized in ticket prices.	non-experiential
the government should mandate price waterlines to cover costs	unverifiable
or the airlines will cut tickets to gain passengers while neglecting their planes and their staff.	unverifiable
the less strict approach on post-purchase increases seems reasonable.	unverifiable
full disclosure on fares will help with purchasing, yes.	unverifiable
firstly, all airline personnel must act as humans and treat their customers as such.	unverifiable
tell us the problem;	unverifiable
don't treat us like cattle;	unverifiable
follow the golden rule when things start to go wrong!	unverifiable
tarmac delay rules should apply to every flight; every flight!	unverifiable
the customers who must exit or who need aid should be served regardless of the size of the plane, its origination, or its destination.	unverifiable
airlines and airports should tell the truth, the whole truth, and treat their customers with respect!	unverifiable
if unpredictable situations arise, well-informed customers who are treated with respect will, most of the time, respond accordingly.	unverifiable
delays, cancellations, etc. are always blamed on the weather now	non-experiential
"and customers, when finally untethered from their seats, are finally freed with an attitude of  ""don't let the door hit you on your way out."""	unverifiable
so that each knows what it must provide when accommodating customers in a crisis.	unverifiable
yes, international customers should not be subjected to more stress and inconvenience by being kept on the plane any longer than normal flight time.	unverifiable
this would be very human, and kind, the kind of thing a company should want to provide for its customers.	unverifiable
as for delays, this depends on the projected duration of delay.	unverifiable
the three-hour limit should have no bearing.	unverifiable
if the delay is more than one hour, customers should be allowed off.	unverifiable
airlines should exert some backbone and make this stick	unverifiable
and customers will admire and appreciate them for it.	unverifiable
this will add to the delay,	unverifiable
as baggage will have to be removed,	unverifiable
but soon enough the problem will be minimal.	unverifiable
dot should prohibit oversales on smaller aircraft unless they can compensate passengers for being bumped.	unverifiable
zero fare customers should be compensated.	unverifiable
jsoodi - you have one major perception in your post,	unverifiable
peanut allergy is common,.	unverifiable
it is not common.	unverifiable
it affects somewhere between .6 and 1.5% of the us population	non-experiential
"and ""severe"" reactions are far more rare then that."	unverifiable
oh well, by all means, lets wait until we have an epidemic of allergy related deaths on planes before we attempt to answer this question.	unverifiable
i wonder how you would react to someone suffocating to death next to you on an airplane.	unverifiable
i agree that 3 hours is way too long to be stranded on the tarmac for health, comfort, and emotional reasons.	unverifiable
i am a bit confused as to why people are not kept at the boarding area longer.	unverifiable
i find it hard to believe that it is always a last minute surprise that comes after everyone is boarded on the plane.	unverifiable
i think there should be a time limit on internatioanl flights as well.	unverifiable
of course all flights should be covered by the 3-hour limit - that's a no-brainer.	unverifiable
this is all about the convenience for airlines, with complete disregard for comfort and safety of the passenger.	unverifiable
airlines need to be reminded that they are a service business and should at least attempt to behave as such.	unverifiable
based on my own experience, buffer zones are pointless because of the poor job the airlines typically do cleaning planes in between flights.	unverifiable
i have a peanut-allergic child,	experiential
and even with an announced buffer zone, there are usually peanuts stuck in the seat cushions or lying on the floor from the previous flight.	unverifiable
the intermediate solution isn't much of a solution.	unverifiable
of all the many, many things that are unsatisfactory about airline travel,	unverifiable
and those that are also within the ability of the airline to control , the issue of tarmac delay is the most important to me and far and away the most troubling.	unverifiable
"i cannot imagine why any airline thinks that it is wise commercial practice to hold its ""customers"" as prisoner in a venue that most of us occupy for only the shortest possible time, commensurate with using the ""service"" at all."	unverifiable
and the proposed rule broadening this practice and shortening the period of involuntary imprisonment should be adopted as is, or even strengthened.	unverifiable
and it makes no difference if these are international or domestic flights, international or domestic airlines, big or small air terminals, etc.	unverifiable
prison is prison.	unverifiable
the obfuscatory practices around the fees are bad enough,	unverifiable
for example, if they mishandle your baggage, they do not refund the fee.	non-experiential
also, there should be a minimum level of service defined in the rules ...	unverifiable
maybe one checked bag and one carryon bag included in the ticket price.	unverifiable
and, yes, very clear information on fees is an absolute ...	unverifiable
travelers should not need to be confused or misdirected regarding the bottom line price of a flight.	unverifiable
make the compensation based on the value of the flight and remove the caps.	unverifiable
and, it should also include fare and fees, since, things seem to be going the way of fees being the larger part of the cost of flying.	unverifiable
due to the many causes for delays,	non-experiential
it is important to have guaranteed delay times.	unverifiable
for example, we are told that there will be an update at 45 minutes past the hour, only to see it move up or back depending on the repair, clearing of weather, arrival of the crew, or other factor.	non-experiential
if there was a specific time locked in, you could go to another area assured that information would be honored and the flight could proceed on a known schedule.	non-experiential
if you ban peanuts being served, then you'll have to ban all carry on food.	unverifiable
couple that with the ban on bringing on personal water and increasingly invasive body searches and air travel is becoming pretty austere.	unverifiable
"i've been on many flights now that airlines no longer serve food where people bring on all sorts of personal food, including extremely ""fragrant"" ethnic foods."	unverifiable
this could easily become a slippery slope, as so much in the govt where we continue to erode personal liberties.	unverifiable
sitting next to a smoker with smoke on their clothes or a person with perfume can trigger an asthma attack for me.	experiential
so let's ban smokers who've had a cigarette in 24 hours and all fragrances.	unverifiable
this is not the brave new world i want to live in!	unverifiable
rather than set explicit dollar amounts for compensation, just make it equivalent to or twice the cost of the ticket in question.	unverifiable
that way, the compensation automatically tracks changes in air fares over time.	unverifiable
it's also worth noting that when i buy bus, train, or ferry tickets i pay up front and own the ticket .	experiential
luckily i have never been in this position yet,  for most of my flights are international.	experiential
if the airline asks me to stay behind i will reject,	unverifiable
there is a reason i set up my flights as i did	unverifiable
so that i can make my international connections or visit friends at those places before i leave the same day.	non-experiential
i think you guys need to make this more clear,	unverifiable
as i am looking over this i cannot really figure out what it is you want us to comment about..	unverifiable
we are talking about departing flights so, in theory, the people on the plane have not yet passed through customs and immigration since they are not in the new country yet.	non-experiential
except for some places where customs is done at the departing airport .	unverifiable
so, yes, if it's that big a deal i would support some kind of holding area.	unverifiable
as a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, i understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.	unverifiable
"the ""rights"" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the ""rights"" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts."	unverifiable
for many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the u.s. via motorhome.	experiential
this is not a reasonable option for everyone	unverifiable
since it can be very time consuming vs. flying.	unverifiable
we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.	unverifiable
we choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple epi-pens, pack his food from home, and i pray.	unverifiable
it's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.	unverifiable
my son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than i do.	experiential
he gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.	experiential
this is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms.	unverifiable
the problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.	unverifiable
their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.	non-experiential
my son is also allergic to milk and eggs.	experiential
nobody talks about banning them	non-experiential
because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.	non-experiential
many people have to travel for work	non-experiential
and others are required to relocate to keep their employment.	non-experiential
i prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society.	unverifiable
if my donut is going to set off your diabetes, i will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.	unverifiable
i can live without it.	non-experiential
everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.	non-experiential
so let's be reasonable	unverifiable
and let all safely travel.	unverifiable
ban the nuts	unverifiable
and see how many more families get onboard.	unverifiable
and that's a good thing.	unverifiable
so i consider myself a frequent flyer.	unverifiable
check t_url for my more airline specific opinions regarding food allergies and food allergy friendly restaurants in many corners of the world.	unverifiable
you have to eat once you get there!	unverifiable
fyi the dot has closed this proposal	non-experiential
as they are not allowed to ban peanuts without further studies.	non-experiential
for more information regarding airborne anaphylaxis  see the below studies published by the national institute of health:	unverifiable
homeowner's should be given an additional grace period to make their payment to the new servicer.	unverifiable
there are various holes in these regulations that will continue to be exploited by the insurance trackers or force-placed insurers, who act on behalf of the loan servicers:	unverifiable
* the wording on the letter doesn't matter,	unverifiable
because the outside of the envelope does not state anywhere that it is from the loan servicers nor that it is important information regarding their mortgage.	non-experiential
this means borrowers will likely overlook the notice no matter how well the letter is written.	unverifiable
* no loan servicer's website currently allows a borrower to update their insurance information online.	non-experiential
this can only be done via assurant or qbe first's generic 3rd party websites.	non-experiential
in today's digital age, there should be a way for borrowers to proactively provide this information, rather than being guided toward a confusing unknown website.	unverifiable
in the case of wells fargo, for example, a borrower would need to go to separate websites for their home and auto loan, since qbe first processes their auto insurance information, while assurant processes their mortgage insurance information.	non-experiential
this is confusing and unacceptable.	unverifiable
* a borrower should be able to speak to an actual employee of the loan servicer.	unverifiable
currently any insurance related interaction  is handled by the insurance tracker or force-placed insurer.	non-experiential
this is especially upsetting in a claims situation where the insurance tracker acts as both parties  and the borrower's interests are completely ignored.	unverifiable
* the insurance tracker and force-placed insurer should not be allowed to be the same company, nor subsidiaries, nor any other version the banksters can come up with.	unverifiable
there is rampant abuse created by this conflict of interest.	non-experiential
the beginning of this section makes it sound like it only applies to hazard insurance,	unverifiable
"however a ""hazard"" lpi policy covers both hazard and wind or hurricane."	non-experiential
in states where a separate wind policy is necessary  the placement of these policies creates an issue of duplicated coverage.	non-experiential
this happened en masse in 2009 when most major insurance companies  stopped underwriting wind policies in florida.	non-experiential
the negative escrow accounts created by false placement of duplicate coverage are how florida became one of the leading states for foreclosure.	non-experiential
remember that escrow accounts are prepaid insurance accounts,	unverifiable
so when a lpi policy is place, and the loan servicer processes an escrow analysis on the loan, the borrower is given 1 year to make up for 2 years of insurance payments.	non-experiential
to make matters worse, the lpi premiums are inflated, and often backdated,	unverifiable
so often the borrower is given much less time to make up for this negative escrow balance.	unverifiable
if an escrow analysis is completed on a borrower with lpi, the premium can drive their monthly mortgage payment up by as much as 1000% to make up for this deficit.	unverifiable
in addition, they can not qualify for a loan modification while they have a negative escrow balance	unverifiable
which is normally caused by the bank's recommendation not to pay their mortgage while the loan mod is processed.	unverifiable
force-placed insurance is why so few borrowers have qualified for the hamp and fha loan modification programs.	unverifiable
all of this is actually done by a 3rd party insurance tracker.	non-experiential
the 2 largest insurance trackers in the us are assurant and qbe first or praetorian .	non-experiential
if these companies sound familiar, it is because they are also the force-placed insurers.	unverifiable
this is how the kickback scheme works,	unverifiable
"and this is why voluntary companies like state farm, usaa and allstate don't provide the force-placed insurance ""product"" to anybody."	unverifiable
lpi should not even be a product.	unverifiable
the insurance tracker is providing the service of placing insurance on a loan.	non-experiential
they are simply choosing to only place their in-house proprietary insurance.	non-experiential
when you send your insurance information to your loan servicer to prove you have insurance, it is actually received by the insurance tracker.	non-experiential
check the volume of utl  documents these insurance trackers recycle on a daily basis,	unverifiable
"and you'll see that they ""lose"" literally tens of thousands of insurance documents every day."	non-experiential
please read my blog to see how this occurs:	unverifiable
"now...another issue is that a loan servicing transfer  will create a ""deletion of interest"" cancellation."	non-experiential
this often create an issue in both home and auto loans where a borrower will be saddled with lpi coverage despite doing nothing to trigger the event.	non-experiential
these insurance trackers can't seem to track your insurance from one of their servicing portfolios to another.	non-experiential
as for escrow vs non-escrow, as i've stated previously, the servicing system will automatically create an escrow account in the event of a non-escrow account.	non-experiential
currently the insurance trackers divide the mail received into queues,	non-experiential
meaning they are purposely dividing them to treat escrow and non-escrow accounts different.	unverifiable
it is very simple to remove these systematic rules from their system to ensure all insurance documents are handled the same.	unverifiable
there are absolutely no practical problems,	non-experiential
and i'd be happy to provide a sworn testimony in court to that effect.	unverifiable
"the servicer already uses the ""overly broad"" argument."	unverifiable
while some of my qwr questions where answered more than once, other very relevant questions where not.	experiential
my servicer refuses to answer these questions, saying they are overly broad.	experiential
i think these questions were very precise.	unverifiable
i took my servicer 62 business days to deny answering these questions.	experiential
if they servicers can't handle the business, they should get out.	unverifiable
for $ 300,000 i think i can demand a little service.	unverifiable
all phone calls should be tracked and recorded, regardless of the servicer's size.	unverifiable
customer service is customer service.	non-experiential
it is not a borrower's responsibility to judge the size of the company serving them.	unverifiable
* i bought my home in 2001.	experiential
citimortgage later purchased my mortgage.	experiential
from 2001-2009 i made all my payments on    time.	experiential
* they would let me know when to start making payments again.	experiential
then the paperwork and reps process began.	experiential
* i sent the same paperwork again, again, and again.	experiential
* in 2009 and 2010 i  was put on temporary payment programs.	experiential
i made all the payments on time.	experiential
* for six months they were elevated payments and made all the elevated payments on time.	experiential
* then back to the modification process and no payments accepted again by the bank.	experiential
* in june the modification process was closed because i could not furnish a letter from ss on how long i would be on    disability.	experiential
that's like asking someone how long do you plan on being employed at your job.	unverifiable
there is no timeline i told them.	experiential
"social security's answer with regards to this is ""indefinite"""	experiential
i am on it till i get well, which doesn't look anytime soon.	experiential
i sent them a dr. note outlining a time frame as much as possible.	experiential
that's all i can get to do so.	unverifiable
* i am now over $45,000 in debt over a three-month deferment and am in imminent threat of losing my home.	experiential
this has to be put to a stop immediately.	unverifiable
please help my family stay in our beloved home.	unverifiable
they are using the h.a.m.p program in a predatory way!	unverifiable
please file a complaint on my behalf.	unverifiable
yes, all loan origination documentation, loan servicing history, customer contact history, etc should be transferred.	unverifiable
if i were to transfer from 1 school to another or 1 primary care provider to another, all of my records are transferred along with me.	non-experiential
with servicing transfers, this is often not done.	non-experiential
also the new servicer should be given a specific deadline to have all of the missing customer information boarded into their systems.	unverifiable
as this is often done en masse and electronically,	non-experiential
it should take no more than 5 days, but let's say 15 days just to be nice.	unverifiable
also, the burden of filling in this missing information should be on the loan servicer, not the borrower.	unverifiable
i don't see any reason why if my bank decides to sell my portfolio, it's suddenly my problem to resubmit information before being hit with fees.	unverifiable
i didn't ask to be part of a portfolio they sold.	non-experiential
that's all banking issues that i, as a consumer, should have no responsibility in.	unverifiable
the list looks fine on the surface,	unverifiable
but i'm not fully versed on all possible loan servicing abuses.	unverifiable
i only know what i've seen.	unverifiable
"i don't like the idea of a set ""covered error"" list,"	unverifiable
but right now i can't think of a better solution.	unverifiable
i'll spend some time pondering and let you know if i come up with any suggestions on this front.	unverifiable
* the loan servicer should be required to disclose that you are being transferred to a 3rd party vendor.	unverifiable
when you click a link for turbotax on irs.gov, for example.	non-experiential
it will tell you that you are about to leave the site.	non-experiential
it's a deceitful practice that is abused.	unverifiable
when you have insurance on your cell phone, for example, the representative  always informs you that you will be speaking to a 3rd party insurance service to file a claim.	unverifiable
* the insurance tracker should never be allowed to also act as the force-placed insurer.	unverifiable
the mortgage company and insurance company should always be separate entities in order to protect the borrower.	unverifiable
allowing an insurance tracker to act as both creates a situation where they will act in their own interests first,	unverifiable
then they will act in the loan servicer's interests,	unverifiable
as they are a large portfolio client.	non-experiential
in this scenario the borrower always loses.	unverifiable
allowing force-placed insurers to act as insurance trackers led to a situation where many hurricane katrina claims are still unresolved to this day!	unverifiable
that is completely unacceptable and should in fact be considered illegal.	unverifiable
the reality is that the representatives from the force-placed insurer have usernames that allow them to log into the mortgage servicing system.	unverifiable
many representatives have even deeper access to your account.	non-experiential
this means they actually have more access to property information than a voluntary insurance company such as farmers, allstate, etc.	non-experiential
in many cases they even have more access than the loan servicer.	non-experiential
this is all highly suspect and needs to be stopped immediately.	unverifiable
the borrower already can ask their banks questions over the phone.	non-experiential
"i have tried ""over the phone"" a lot."	experiential
i have heard they have the original note at a time when they were not supposed to have it.	experiential
"i have heard ""we don't have the note"" when they were supposed to have it."	experiential
very simple questions such as the amount of reinstatement fees have gone unanswered over the phone.	experiential
in hindsight i wish i would have recorded some of the phone conversations.	unverifiable
i costs the consumer more time and money to request information in writing - not the servicer.	non-experiential
i can only advise homeowners to have it all in written form and send it by certified mail.	unverifiable
i don't think homeowners have any benefit by asking questions over the phone .	unverifiable
when borrowers call in for information or documents, borrowers should be sent limited access permission to view only their account information and loan documents  in the company document viewer portals,	unverifiable
borrowers should be permitted to print out all docs found in their loan records.	unverifiable
this automated process is relatively cost free for the institution and allows the borrowers to gain access to requested docs, and also information pertaining to servicing issues.	non-experiential
should the borrower have additional needs beyond this there should be a special link the borrower can intiate in the portal to request additonal information or personal contact from the institution.	unverifiable
the institution can use this individual posting board to communicate with the borrower, log comments and actions regarding borrowers inquiry.	non-experiential
this posting board or communication log should be fully accessible by the borrower with complete transparentcy.	unverifiable
from a technical standpoint, direct access to a loan servicer's web based client portal via a simple username or password is impractical.	unverifiable
there are many technical settings, vpn's, etc that are set up when vendors access these.	non-experiential
what they can do, however, is build the code and databases to allow borrowers to access this information via their consumer websites.	non-experiential
they also need a way for borrowers to be able to submit, review, and update insurance information on these websites.	unverifiable
many servicers, such as bank of america, already have customer service available via chat through their website as well.	non-experiential
chat could be an option for customers who are weary of speaking to a representative over the phone and would like a record of the conversation.	unverifiable
either way, you have the right idea that these companies need to both upgrade and better utilize their technological capabilities.	unverifiable
the answers to my qwr were quite surprising.	unverifiable
"the servicer might argue they have too high of costs and burden to reply and that some are ""overly broad""."	experiential
however, the servicer had no problem providing me pages and pages of payoff statement and payment history	experiential
"however, even after they wrote me that they checked the reinstatement fees and confirmed those as ""correct"" they cannot itemize even half of them."	experiential
that would take one or two pages to print out and mail - much easier than the information they were willing to provide.	unverifiable
"that request was ""too broad""."	unverifiable
so yes, the servicer can call too broad what ever they want to.	unverifiable
i will now write a new qwr asking again for itemization of the fees.	unverifiable
as a bank they should be able to find out how they themselves came up with that number -	unverifiable
by the way - the confirmation about the fees being correct came in writing and a copy went to the cfpb.	unverifiable
i don't believe i would have gotten an answer at all if i had not complained with the cfpb.	unverifiable
and here is a suggestion for the servicer to cut cost:	unverifiable
"in pre-foreclosure we received a ""home transition guide"" - magazine style and no doubt expensive to print and send that we really didn't care for."	experiential
during the hamp modification trial we received the same request for our tax returns via fed ex over and over again .	experiential
also, ten days after we reinstated, they send fed ex again with a note that we needed to short sale or give them the deed in lieu of foreclosure.	experiential
some servicers are either completely ineffective with internal communication or they really enjoy throwing money at fed ex.	unverifiable
"also: the proposed clause ""for information it can't get from its records in the ""ordinary course of business"" with ""reasonable efforts"" is downright inviting fraud."	unverifiable
they need the original promissory note with endorsements or allonge to assign it when the loan is transferred.	unverifiable
it makes it even easier to deny the request of a copy of the endorsed note.	unverifiable
this exclusion would give them right to hide fees from their affiliates.	unverifiable
that could make the game of inflated maintenance fees in foreclosure, force placed insurance, unearned kickback fees, attorney fees a whole new chance.	unverifiable
if a servicer charges these fees, they should know what they are for and have no problem of disclosing.	unverifiable
the servicer already successfully denies to answer qwr that can be interpreted as nothing but harassment.	unverifiable
no i don't.	unverifiable
my conclusion is that the servicers just don't want to inform the consumers.	unverifiable
nothing too difficult.	unverifiable
it is just that some information they do not want to give.	unverifiable
the cfpb's only role is to protect the consumer.	unverifiable
they should not even have to worry about making it easier for or less costly for the servicer or the bank.	unverifiable
my servicer chose to spend money on hiring a high profile law firm only to  answer my qwr entirely.	unverifiable
well - that is their choice.	unverifiable
if the cfpb gives the servicers a pass on not giving information more than a year after a servicing transfer, it is imperative that the rules for a full information servicing transfer are solid and enforced.	unverifiable
that has been addressed in another section,	non-experiential
loss of information between 2 banks at no fault to the borrower should never be allowed,	unverifiable
and it happens all too often in the current environment.	non-experiential
all of the information is instantaneously available.	non-experiential
if it's not, it's the bank's fault, not the borrower's.	unverifiable
"it is ""reasonable"" to expect that if you lent me $100,000 that you would be able to tell me absolutely anything i ask about that $100,000 within a 5 minute phone conversation."	unverifiable
if anyone needs an illustration, lend me $100,000 in cash right now from 1 private citizen to another.	unverifiable
you are 1 person,	non-experiential
and i am 1 person.	non-experiential
and you will know how much i owe you.	unverifiable
a professional should always be better than an amateur.	unverifiable
that's why they're professionals.	unverifiable
if they're not better, they will be displaced.	unverifiable
that's how capitalism works.	unverifiable
if they haven't been displaced, there is corruption in the air.	unverifiable
"for ""overbroad"" and ""unduly burdensome"" information or ""unreasonable volume of documents or information"" i have to point out that there are hundreds of employees at every servicer capable of creating queries that can be implemented and applied quite easily  to pull any and all loan information for a specific borrower."	non-experiential
it can all be exported into a spreadsheet, pdf, image file, and more.	non-experiential
it is a simple process and can be attached to the sql gui's utilized by every loan servicer with very minimal effort or cost to the servicer.	unverifiable
there is absolutely no excuse not to be able to provide any information within 5 minutes.	unverifiable
it is not a borrower's fault that the banks lost their information,	unverifiable
and if the situation were reversed, the borrower would not be given  45 days or any types of excuses.	unverifiable
use your physical debit card anywhere in the world.	unverifiable
sign into your bank account 15 minutes later.	unverifiable
the charge will show in your account.	unverifiable
write a check to pay one of your bills.	unverifiable
within 5 business days , an image of that check will be available online.	unverifiable
it is criminal racketeering,	unverifiable
and it needs to be stopped,	unverifiable
and they need to be thoroughly punished for these continued crimes.	unverifiable
these cfpb rules thus far are a complete joke.	unverifiable
in contacting a customer, emails and text messages should be allowed,	unverifiable
but they should be done in conjunction with the 3 phone calls, not in lieu of them.	unverifiable
for example, if the loan servicer has an email address available, after the 3 phone calls, they should be required to try 3 emails.	unverifiable
starting contact efforts 16 days out should be completely fine if a borrower opts in for text messaging.	unverifiable
"a simple text of ""your mortgage payment is now due. payment must be received by  to avoid any late fees or collection efforts. if you are unable to make your payment, please contact  at  for alternative options."" text would actually be a great customer service option."	unverifiable
it may be good to mirror these after fair debt collection practices.	unverifiable
the servicing systems need to be updated  to ensure that once a borrower accepts a loss mitigation option, these notification options are properly updated.	unverifiable
for example, there's no need to keep calling someone to say their payment is late if they've already begun the forebearance process,	unverifiable
the loan term change should update the contact dates, etc.	unverifiable
also, if a borrower has a heloc, 2nd mortgage, or is listed as a co-borrower any other property, they should all be considered together at the time of the initial call.	unverifiable
these accounts should all be linked so that a borrower facing default on 3 loans for the same property is not overwhelmed, confused, etc.	unverifiable
the samples are as clear as they can be.	unverifiable
most borrowers won't understand any of it anyway.	unverifiable
the biggest thing is to ensure they know who they can contact and making sure the c or s reps are fully trained on proper options and disclosures.	unverifiable
i would definitely recommend that a written notice of confirmation is sent to the borrower for any changes made to their account as well.	unverifiable
while it may not fully assist them,	non-experiential
and they may choose to ignore the letters,	non-experiential
from a servicer standpoint, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.	unverifiable
this technology is built into loan servicing software suites,	non-experiential
and if a company can't afford loan servicing software, they really have no business servicing loans.	unverifiable
if they do, everything can be handled via the web, and email or text notifications can be sent.	non-experiential
these notifications should contain the exact same information as the paper statement.	unverifiable
they would just be received earlier	non-experiential
again, since everything can be done electronically,	non-experiential
there needs to be a way for borrowers to view or update their insurance information electronically through the loan servicer, without having to go to assurant or qbe's highly deceptive websites.	unverifiable
if a borrower doesn't want electronic access, that is their choice.	unverifiable
servicers such as wells fargo, bank of america, and jpmorgan already have websites set up.	non-experiential
adding mortgage or insurance information should not be difficult and should already have been done.	unverifiable
this addresses nothing in my example.	unverifiable
they notified me of lmo's but then hid the fact they applied extra risk percentage of 2.5%, meaning the npv caluculated by my using the hamp site did not match the npv value they came up with, since wells fargo was adding unbeknown to consumers 2.5% risk to the prime.	experiential
telling them all the lmo's means nothing if they do not have full disclosures on the numbers used in the npv model their calculations, and their deteminations.	unverifiable
they should not be able to disqualify anyone from a lmo unless they fully disclose all the calculations used to determine that disqualification.	unverifiable
the lender should not be able to place forced insurance and replace the primary titled owner as the beneficiary of any loss policy issued on an pre forclosure asset,	unverifiable
until forclosure occurs, the deed is and remains in the ownership under homestead laws of most states, the borrower's legal property.	unverifiable
i can understand the insurance requirement.	unverifiable
the borrower should not be required to assume debt, that defies market logic,and then be liable for that debt being issued when they can derive no direct benefit from it, not even policy ownership.	unverifiable
also the lender should be required to obtain insurance at prevailing fair market insurance rates the regular consumer pays at the very most,	unverifiable
when i was forced into reo due to default, and on medical disability, the monthly insurance cost was three times the annual cost of my then existing annual allstate policy cost.	experiential
which had also had additonal riders including liability umbrellas, for my auto and additional personal medical for visitors, comprehensive platinum content coverage,	experiential
it belies common sense that they be allowed to fleece and abuse already indigent homeowners, like that. charging 3 times what my full policy costs in a year, in a single month, and not even convering the whole contents of the house.	unverifiable
they should have to use and provide traditional carrier insurance throught market channels at prevailing fair market insurance rates for the property,	unverifiable
i had no problem blindly insuring my house with my current carrier from six states away,	experiential
in fact they knew the number of claims ever filed on the property being insured as well as any claims i had filed on the property i owned prior to this one.	experiential
all of this over inflation claim of excessive risk on reo insurance is a scam designed to insure they overcome the bankruptcy discount on cram downs.	unverifiable
it prevents qualification for lmo's prevents curing of default as well.	unverifiable
there is no reason for it.	unverifiable
reo and force-placed insurance are 2 different products.	non-experiential
the reo policy shouldn't have a borrower's name as the beneficiary because it is placed on a property post-foreclosure,	unverifiable
and a borrower should not be held responsible for any reo charges whatsoever.	unverifiable
currently, escrow accounts are systematically added to every foreclosure.	non-experiential
the point it happens is dependent on the state and whether the lender is fnma, fmac, or other.	non-experiential
these illegally created escrow accounts are illegally saddled with exorbitant monthly reo premiums,	non-experiential
which end up being charged to the borrower, not the lender.	non-experiential
this is also an example of rampant racketeering and mortgage abuse,	unverifiable
but it is a separate issue from the force-placed premiums falsely placed on mortgages, automobile liens, and other collateral loans.	unverifiable
no, it doesn't.	unverifiable
the new industry practice is that loss mitigation or modifications are to be offered if it is financially better for the investor to modify the homeowner instead of foreclosing, a positive net present value.	non-experiential
but the proposed rules are just a delay for wall street to continue business as usual with no regard for fairness or equality, when there were over 5 million modifications issued to avoid the investors fiancial loss when negative equity was involved, setting the new industry practice or legal precedent what is offered in the normal course of business for negative equity homeowners.	unverifiable
the home was bought and the mortage was invested in under the principles of capitalism,	unverifiable
we need our governmental agencies to not only recongnize this but to act on it.	unverifiable
there is no capitalistic financial difference to the homeowner or investor in a foreclosure situation when the property has a loan to value of 135%, 100%, 115% etc..	non-experiential
my argument is unless we treated housing as the capitalistic product it is, there will be no recovery.	unverifiable
"what is being proposed is that we continue to allow the ""fox in the hen house"" making their own decisions on who gets a modification or gets foreclosed on based on totally unrevelant factors,"	unverifiable
this is what must be changed.	unverifiable
all homeowners have a built in reliance because of existing laws that wall street would have to act with good faith and fair dealings with them.	unverifiable
it would be impossible to give a 60 day notice on a rate change,	non-experiential
when the index you use is supposed to be 45 days prior to the change date, as written in the original note signed by the borrower.	non-experiential
it will not however save the consumer from a questionable prior financial decision .	unverifiable
that is why presenting the critical information upfront, in a standard form single page 10-12point font that emphasizes the reality of the financial agreement they are being presented with, is the real practical force and effect of this rule secrion.	unverifiable
we received our notice of servicing as outlined here,	experiential
however, the company doing the servicing did not have all the correct information and did not honor the temporary modification outlined by the previous servicer causing us untold hardship and stress.	experiential
because of their delay in information and application they immediately came after us for charges and late fees that we could not have avoided.	experiential
it was unfair and predatory.	unverifiable
in addition, our previous lender did not work fairly with us,	experiential
but now that they have sold our loan they no longer have to work with us to correct the flaws in our loan,	experiential
they simply wash their hands	unverifiable
"and the new lender or servicer can truthfully say it was not ""their"" fault."	unverifiable
this option does not take into account the fraud perpetrated by many lenders.	unverifiable
while they manipulated libor rates and charged outrageous interest, lying to homebuyers about the loans and ignoring phone calls and pleas for workouts until it was too late to fix the problem.	non-experiential
the lenders were required to write modifications by our government,	non-experiential
however it was not legally enforceable	non-experiential
so they played games with borrowers by dragging out the modification process until the borrower missed a payment or became dismally discouraged or lost a job.	non-experiential
many of these lenders are still playing games with the homebuyers and not working with them, but foreclosing with impunity.	non-experiential
"i think that lenders should be forced to include principle write-downs as part of their ""workout"" to prevent foreclosure."	unverifiable
the amount of information that is publicly available regarding the fraud that brought us into this place should be enough evidence that the homebuyer should not have to bear this burden alone.	unverifiable
it is time to get some real relief for the homebuyers	unverifiable
* currently their are more foreclosed homes than families without homes, and no sign of letting up.	unverifiable
the consumer cannot continue to carry this fraud alone	unverifiable
* we did not initiate it.	unverifiable
the way the statement is broken down is fine .	unverifiable
what i mean is that even though it's provided on the statement, customer service reps  need to be required to disclose the same information to borrowers.	unverifiable
in today's day and age of automatic payments and electronic transfers, it's important that all lines of communication are treated the same.	unverifiable
few people use snail mail,	non-experiential
and in another 20 years, it'll likely be a thing of the past.	unverifiable
many of these regulation seem geared toward the past rather than the technological present and future.	unverifiable
the cost to enter the market or remain in the market shouldn't be a consideration.	unverifiable
that's all between the investor and the servicers.	unverifiable
if the investor  want to provide options for smaller servicers, that is up to their discretion.	unverifiable
if you leave a small servicer exception, it will be used as a loophole for the larger banks to create subsidiaries and exploit these, much like they do with taxes.	unverifiable
if there ends up not being enough servicers to service the loans, then that's something the investors need to look at.	unverifiable
from my perspective, you're trying to fix the effects rather than the cause.	unverifiable
the servicers are all about making a buck.	unverifiable
they need to be held to mortgage modification offers.	unverifiable
if they lose paperwork, it needs to be on them, not the homeowner.	unverifiable
modifications should be processed and approved with or without paperwork.	unverifiable
let's be realistic here,	unverifiable
the borrower needs to take some responsibility	unverifiable
since they should know they are delinquent on their loan.	unverifiable
i think three phone calls on three separate days is more than a good faith effort.	unverifiable
if the consumer fails to notify the bank that they changed their phone number, it once again points to the negligence of the consumer.	unverifiable
this is going to drive up the costs and fees associated with getting a mortgage in the first place.	unverifiable
one phone call or contact of some sort should be more than enough effort on the lender's side.	unverifiable
the consumer knows they are delinquent and needs to take some responsibility for their actions.	unverifiable
i agree that a change should be made if the borrower has already negotiated terms so that they aren't repeatedly contacted.	unverifiable
it would be beneficial to have a proper breakdown of where a mortgage payment is going.	unverifiable
my current lender puts the information on the statement	experiential
but it is so disorganized that i can't tell what went to interest, escrow, pmi, etc.	unverifiable
this would be another software change that would require more of an expense to financial institutions.	unverifiable
the cost of these changes has to be made up in income,	unverifiable
which would ultimately come as a charge to the consumer.	unverifiable
the comparisons you are making have no merit.	unverifiable
you are missing the point here.	unverifiable
requirements like these can regulate smaller banks and credit unions right out of business.	unverifiable
then your only option would be to use a wells fargo-type bank for your mortgage loan.	unverifiable
small, rural institutions know their customer base and always make themselves available.	unverifiable
that being said, the top few points you made deal with public health and safety,	unverifiable
if you can please tell me how they relate to the financial industry that would be swell.	unverifiable
my point is that in a small institution you will be able to speak with a person, either on the phone or face to face.	non-experiential
they will always be reachable and in most cases you will be able to talk directly to the person who originated your loan.	non-experiential
you would not get transferred 3 times and given the run-around that a large instituion tends to do.	non-experiential
a small institution with 1-30 employees doesn't have the resources available to make large systems changes.	non-experiential
if you do not work in the industry you would have no clue how much it costs to contract with a central processor.	unverifiable
from your comments on every topic, i can tell that you are casting stones at the financial industry for some unknown reason.	unverifiable
small banks and credit unions were not the dishonest ones who tried to pull the wool over consumers eyes in the first place.	unverifiable
all of the new proposals appear to be good and are what small banks have been doing for years.	unverifiable
my small bank has over half of their loans in home mortgages and have not forclosed on one in over 10 years.	experiential
rules like this one could make it harder on small banks to work with customers and more expensive to make mortgage loans.	unverifiable
as an advocate for homeowners in foreclosure, i am on the phone with servicers large and small every day.	experiential
while foreclosure education is always needed,	unverifiable
i think a more pressing issue is regulation of servicers who misrepresent their own investors and who decieve borrowers for their own financial gain.	unverifiable
this would be valid if it were true,	unverifiable
as investors are not required to to consent to a modification.	non-experiential
however, oftentimes this is just an excuse the servicers use to keep a client in default and to keep raking in fees that benefit themselves	non-experiential
investor's usually recieve principle and interest,	non-experiential
while servicers recieve all the late fees, and other fees associated with servicing an account.	non-experiential
there are few cases when there is a legitamite investor restriction.	unverifiable
anytime a servicer cites one, i ask for the name of the investor and the name and series of the trust the mortgage was probably pooled into.	experiential
then, if the trust is public i look it up on the sec website t_url	experiential
then i open the pooling and servicing agreement section which pertains to modifications.	experiential
in 95% of cases the agreement petween the investor and the servicer gives the servicer the ability to recapitalize loans, reduce interest and or or reduce princible as they see fit.	experiential
oftentime the servicer is already modifying other loans within the portfolio in the same trust.	experiential
we prove this by pulling up investor reports banks issue to their investors regarding each trust.	experiential
when confronted with written proof that there is in fact no investor restriction, or that the restriction has been waived servicers will often retract their claim that there is a restriction.	experiential
but then they often come up with another illegitamate excuse such as a modification denial due to npv , or that the client needs to have their second mortgage subordinated .	experiential
the problem is that few ordinary homeowners have the education or resources to push back against servicers.	unverifiable
if the investors found out that their servicers were tanking their portfolio by not agreeing to profitable modifications  they would be outraged.	unverifiable
so yes, having servicers educate homeowners to their options is a great idea.	unverifiable
but even when they are educated they will still lose their homes if the servicers are not not further regulated.	unverifiable
unfortunately many homeowners were decieved by many profit-driven companies at orginination ,	non-experiential
and now they are being decieved on the back end when they need some real assistance to save them from losing their home.	unverifiable
if the cfpb wants to do something about this, penalties against deceptive servicers would be a start.	unverifiable
"the cfpb could expand the covered error ""not providing accurate information to a borrower in trouble about loss mitigation options"" to specifically include decpetive practices, such as improper denials i mentioned."	unverifiable
this will pave the way for enforcement actions which will be necessary to check most for-profit servicers	unverifiable
i understand that at a certain point when a loan is past due if the lender is continuing the foreclosure process that they can not accept payments,	non-experiential
however i do not understand why they can't accept partial payments and apply them to the loan.	unverifiable
by not accepting the payment unfortunately what happens is people pay something else that has to be paid.	non-experiential
my previous employer serviced loans	experiential
and we did all of the things being suggested, proactively called borrowers to setup a payment plan	experiential
so they continued to receive funds.	experiential
most lender's are not like this and won't talk to you until you are delinquent and even tell you not to make the payment this is wrong and not helping the consumer that called prior to the loan being past due to try and resolve the situation.	unverifiable
lender's should be ashamed.	unverifiable
as a previous servicer of accounts, the timeframes in which the servicer has to respond are very generous almost to generous,	experiential
really this information is not that hard to provide especially if it is given verbally, written notices to the consumer would take longer.	unverifiable
this has always been the threat from the banks:	unverifiable
well, they have already done that.	non-experiential
this is not about cost cutting.	unverifiable
i wrote a qwr to find out about fees	experiential
and the servicer hires a high profile law firm so they don't have to answer.	non-experiential
if they would not have attached unexplained fees, they would not have to spend money on lawyers.	unverifiable
this is capitalism.	unverifiable
if the business doesn't make them enough profit, get out of the business.	unverifiable
if illegal behavior will cost them, they should consider not doing it anymore.	unverifiable
that all would cut their legal fees immensely.	unverifiable
most information can be provided electronically.	non-experiential
if servicers are interested in cutting costs, they already have many electronic systems in place to provide this information.	unverifiable
i've worked in the back end with these servicers.	experiential
i know how their systems and sql databases are connected.	experiential
i know what reports are available.	experiential
"it is absolutely unacceptable for them to claim any information is ""unreasonable"" to retrieve."	unverifiable
it is nothing more than an excuse they are using to keep anything from changing.	unverifiable
"for the record, there are very few ""rules"" that the cfpb are proposing that are any different than what the servicers already have in place."	unverifiable
the fines are minimal,	unverifiable
and the audits are a joke.	unverifiable
in the 7 years i worked in the back end, there was only ever 2 audits,	unverifiable
"and in both cases, we were given a week's notice of the information what would be reviewed during the ""surprise"" audit."	unverifiable
during this time, reports were adjusted, numbers were faked, and mistakes were hidden.	unverifiable
"i've seen nothing in these proposed ""rules"" that will have any affect whatsoever on any of the corrupt happenings i've witnessed during my career with the banks."	unverifiable
i bought my home in 2005 and took out a fixed rate loan.	experiential
i put $100,000 down and in 2005 it was worth $267,000.00.	experiential
now it is worth $144,000.00.	experiential
i started my title company in 2004.	experiential
in 2007, when the market tanked, we were able to stay afloat for 3 years.	experiential
during this time period, we were on the equity acceleration program and were making 2 payments a month.	experiential
we were attempting to get the loan paid off as quickly as possible.	experiential
in 2009, i closed my company due to a lack of business.	experiential
i was lucky to get a job a month after i closed the company and started making payments again.	experiential
i was only behind on my mortgage 2 months.	experiential
i tried to work with chase later in 2010 to see if i could get the 2 months added to the back of the loan and was told that i could not afford the home.	experiential
i told the rep that i was and had been making the payment.	experiential
i am losing my home this year	experiential
simply because the servicers of the loan would not work with me.	experiential
i am not asking for a compliant to be filed	experiential
because i have come to terms with what has happened to me and the fact that i am losing the home.	experiential
what i want you to do is put regulations in place that will make these lenders work with homeowners.	unverifiable
people cannot make their payment if they do not have a job.	unverifiable
the lenders need to be held accountable for their actions.	unverifiable
i realize that many people chose to purchase a home that they really could not afford,	unverifiable
but that does not give the right for the lender to foreclose with the incorrect paperwork or fraudulently signed papers.	unverifiable
if they are going to take someones house, then they need to do it the right way, with the correct paperwork and signatures.	unverifiable
it is not the homeowners fault that the lenders cannot get the appropriate paperwork signed at closing	unverifiable
and it is also not their fault if the lenders cannot keep the documents in the file where they belong.	unverifiable
i am sorry that the lenders do not have a system set up to where they can keep the paperwork safe for the time when they possibly need it.	unverifiable
lenders should be required to have people to assist you woth your loan at the branch.	unverifiable
when i arrive at the branch they should not dictate to me an 800 number that keeps me on hold.	unverifiable
when you state all borrowers, it truly should be all borrowers.	unverifiable
my case is not unlike many thousands of homeowners across the country,	unverifiable
but i'll bet many have not even heard of this situation.	unverifiable
some servicers are now cutting off all contact with persons with past bankrutcies, no statements, no web access, no infomation on how much was paid in interest so the homeowner can't file income taxes etc etc etc...	non-experiential
this is happening right now to homeowners everywhere.	non-experiential
i think bankruptcy should not be used as an excuse to abuse homeowners who have already suffered enough.	unverifiable
a rule protecting all borrowers needs to brough into focus.	unverifiable
if the homeowner requests statements, then the servicer is not in violation of an automatic stay.	unverifiable
so cfpb needs to close this loop where the servicers is abusing the homeowner.	unverifiable
this trend is just starting,	unverifiable
and with one rather notorious non-bank servicer now snapping up these servicing rights, more and more homeowners in or through bankruptcy will be shut off from any info on their loans.	unverifiable
this is a simple fix for the cfpb without stepping on any bk rules,	unverifiable
just require servicers to provide online access and monthly statements when the homeowner specifically requests.	unverifiable
one major force-placed insurance issue that needs to be addressed is how it is constantly referred to as a product.	unverifiable
lpi is not a product.	non-experiential
lpi is a service by definition.	non-experiential
whether you refer to it as force-placed or lender-placed, the point is that it is insurance that they are buying for you.	unverifiable
they should only be allowed to charge a maximum of $35  for the service of price shopping insurance for a consumer.	unverifiable
they should be legally required to select the cheapest insurance available through this necessary force-placed insurance service .	unverifiable
the collection of this $35 service fee would offset any of these mortgage servicing costs the cfpb feels should be passed on to consumers for creating a bill.	unverifiable
"* what i was clearly doing was bringing up examples of other ""service"" industries in order to illustrate the obvious connection that regulation in every other ""service"" industry is the same,"	experiential
"and yet as soon as the words ""mortgage"" or ""financial"" are placed in front of the word ""service"" the regulations suddenly change."	unverifiable
you are failing to see the forest for the trees.	unverifiable
i'm not as easily fooled.	unverifiable
"this is why i compare the health ""service"" industry to the food ""service"" industry to the financial ""service"" industry."	unverifiable
* in regards to your argument about small businesses being reachable, once again, laws have to be written in a consistent manner.	unverifiable
technically a corporation like wells fargo, jpmorgan, or bank of america can make the exact claim you're making for small business, and with more validity.	unverifiable
they have tens of thousands of worldwide branches and call centers staffed nearly 24 or 7 by tens of thousands of employees.	non-experiential
they have websites that can be accessed globally.	non-experiential
i can be on vacation in tahiti and still view my balance on their website and possibly still even find a branch to talk to someone in person.	unverifiable
your small business can't do that,	unverifiable
and therefore in the eyes of the law, they are not nearly as reachable as you think from your narrow viewpoint.	unverifiable
* i know exactly how much it costs to make a system change.	unverifiable
i know what systems are involved.	unverifiable
in fact, if your small business is strapped for cash, i'd be more than happy to offer my services to assist in creating the templates necessary to create and send out a monthly bill to a customer.	unverifiable
i'll do it for very cheap, because it's very easy to do.	unverifiable
as a matter of fact, it's a feature built into any office program.	unverifiable
if your mom and pop bank has microsoft office, they can do it within an hour.	unverifiable
i can link everything to a sql database,	unverifiable
but as we're discussing a small mom and pop shop with 1-30 employees,	unverifiable
they likely don't have enough customers to necessitate sql servers.	unverifiable
as a former employee of the mortgage servicing industry for clients such as jpmorgan, wells fargo, bank of america, countrywide home loans, aurora loan services, indymac federal, onewest bank, financial freedom, saxon loan services, select portfolio services, pennymac, wachovia, compass bank, downey savings and loans, gmac, homecomings financial, ally financial, and more, i'd be happy more than happy to address any further concerns you may have and provide any additional training or education you may need in order to fully understand these rules as well as i do.	unverifiable
there were late fees,	non-experiential
they fee was $25 once the payment researched 10 days past due.	non-experiential
the late fee was the last thing they collected	experiential
and depending on the circumstances and the plan with the client to go foward many times the late fee was waived,	non-experiential
their goal was to get the loan current and avoid foreclosure.	non-experiential
a payment reminder and a call were made to the client after the account became past due 10 days,	non-experiential
the servicer's goal was to discuss the situation with the client and propose options to get the account back on track.	non-experiential
a majority of people want to work this out,	unverifiable
they need help.	unverifiable
the plan this agreement was followed up in a letter to the client and or or depending on the changes made may require the client to sign documents,	non-experiential
these items were all taken care of prior to the loan being 30 days past due if the client was willing to work with the servicer.	non-experiential
they encouraged people to be proactive.	unverifiable
i had an instance where we had some medical things happen	experiential
and i knew i was going to be late on a payment and called the servicer prior to the payment being due and was told there was nothing they could talk to me about and recommended i let the loan go past due!	experiential
i had the funds to make 2 or 3's of the payment but unless it was a full payment they wouldn't accept it.	experiential
i was horrified by this and the service i received.	unverifiable
i know better because of my job	unverifiable
but your everyday client doesn't	unverifiable
and they trust what they are being told.	unverifiable
these large servicers have a racket going.	unverifiable
they need to get back to the mentally they are their to help the customer not go past due and find ways restructure.	unverifiable
i can't believe there is a lender that would not wanted to receive additional dollars on an account and not go through the foreclosure process if possible.	unverifiable
the cost of foreclosure for the lender is expensive,	unverifiable
if the mentally was to correct and help clients work through their situation servicers would need people with more experience than they have which currently is a phone bank of people with canned answers.	unverifiable
all of these proposals, rules and regulations are futile if there's nobody enforcing them.	unverifiable
i've had 4 different customer relationship managers and have always gotten voice mail every time i called.	experiential
occasionally i would get a call back but usually not.	experiential
"i have faxed and ""fed-exed"" my documents numerous times"	experiential
and each time they claim they did not receive them, even though i have fax confirmations and tracked the fed-ex package to make sure it was delivered.	experiential
i am completely frustrated with the whole process.	unverifiable
i have been trying to get my payments lowered and keep sending and resending paperwork	experiential
now i have been informed that there is nothing that can be done.	experiential
my partner had to borrow against her 401k plan in order to get our mortgage caught up	experiential
now we have been informed that our payment will be increased from 2016.26 to 2510,	experiential
now this just seem very stupid to me	unverifiable
since we were having a problem making the lower payment and wanted it lowered so it could be made from one of my paychecks.	experiential
i feel that mortgages should use net income instead of gross income.	unverifiable
that would prevent a lot of problems in my opinion.	unverifiable
not unless you have an efficient process to enforce those regulations.	unverifiable
what would make it easier would be a requirement that the servicers have a system by which files could be uploaded electronically by the consumer through a secure, log-in to use type site.	unverifiable
a site where consumers could see a document check-list and view which documents had been received as well as outstanding documents, due dates, messages, etc.	unverifiable
right now i am at the mercy of the customer relations manager.	experiential
"it's a ""he said-she said"" battle because i have sent documents,"	experiential
but they say they didn't get them.	experiential
even though i have fax confirmations and fed-ex tracking numbers that show delivery,	experiential
i can't prove what documents were delivered.	experiential
we are a small community bank.  assets of about $225 million.	experiential
we service more than 1,000 loans	experiential
ergo we're not a small servicer.	experiential
cfpb was created by morons  and is run by morons for the benefit of morons.	unverifiable
consumers are going to get protection - good and hard!	unverifiable
however, if either of them changes the address to a p.o. box, or one separate from the home or property, there ought to be a provision that one monthly statement goes to the residence, unless both parties have a new separate address.	unverifiable
it's really important.	unverifiable
the additional communications, as proposed on this site, are a good thing, of and by themselves.	unverifiable
however, i believe there is another problem that should be addressed, in addition.	unverifiable
"especially with the currently low rates , ideally a prospective customer should perform a ""stress-test"" on their own financial situation, and ask realistically could they afford the loan if rates climb in the long term, and specifically how they would accomplish this."	unverifiable
an alert is nice,	unverifiable
but the options are far greater before the agreement is signed.	unverifiable
therefore, my recommendation would be to put equal--or greater--emphasis on clear communication and discussion of options before the loans are signed, with a focus on worst-case increases.	unverifiable
"e.g. ""if rates do climb substantially, and your arm rate goes to it's highest allowed level of __x%__, your monthly payment would be __$xx,xxx__."	unverifiable
even if the prospective customer doesn't provide an answer to the loan officer, that might trigger some very useful discussions among spouses, co-signers, etc	unverifiable
i assume that lenders would detest such a requirement,	unverifiable
but fundamentally we do need to enforce reality-checks at some stage:	unverifiable
history and basic logic indicate that the people who are paid to generate loans are not the best guardians of long-term risk.	unverifiable
i.e. how much of an increase could you really afford.	unverifiable
requiring a prospective borrower do the math might be a useful reality check -	unverifiable
even if the person fudges the numbers, at least the issue will have been implanted in their head.	unverifiable
let me first give you some background	unverifiable
so you can fully understand what has happened.	unverifiable
my partner developed cancer without medical insurance.	experiential
this catastrophic event eventually led me into bankruptcy.	experiential
my partner died 3 weeks before i recieved the chapter 7 discharge.	experiential
three weeks after the discharge, i signed permanent hamp modification documents that lowered the payment on my house.	experiential
it is still my home	experiential
and i want to keep it.	unverifiable
and i paid my mortgage every month for over a year with no issues.	experiential
my servicer provided online access as well as monthly statements.	experiential
"the monthly statements have a disclaimer at the bottom that read: ""aurora bank is a debt collector."	experiential
aurora bank is attampting to collect a debt	experiential
and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.	experiential
"however, if you are in bankruptcy or received a bankruptcy dischagre of the debt, this communication is not an attempt to collect the debt agaiinst you personall, but is notice of a possible enforcement of the lien against the collateral property."""	experiential
this statement protects the servicer against any automatic stay violations,	experiential
it's standard throughout the industry.	experiential
i was lucky to recieve a hamp mod and was one of the success stories about hamp.	experiential
but suddenly aurora closed,	experiential
and the servicing rights went to a non-bank company.	experiential
this is after over a year of success.	experiential
the new servicer is the one not providing statements.	experiential
"they quote ""it is our policy to deny online access to accounts and will not provide mortgage statements to anyone who has had a bankruptcy and did not reaffirm the loan""."	experiential
so this is not about violating any bankruptcy law,	unverifiable
they simply choose to not cooperate, or worse are trying to leverage the statement information to get people to reaffirm!	unverifiable
no bankruptcy judge would reaffirm a mortgage that was $100,000 underwater at the time.	experiential
the judges go out of their way to not approve reaffirmation agreements because it is not in the best interest of the debtor. simple as that.	unverifiable
so the new servicer could easily just pick up where the old servicer left off,	unverifiable
but they refuse based on their own unfair policy.	unverifiable
perhaps because they make more money on defaulting loans,	unverifiable
they keep the fees	unverifiable
and the investor gets what's leftover after a foreclosure sale.	unverifiable
so if they make it difficult for the homeowner, many will just give up and walk away.	unverifiable
"the servicer then gets the ""fees"" after the sale."	unverifiable
also the non-bank servicer does not have to answer to most government financial regulations,	unverifiable
the fdic, treasury, office of currency comptroller do not oversee non-banks, so there is no way to file a complaint with them.	non-experiential
i was lucky to find cfpb,	unverifiable
i just pray you can intervene not only for me, but the many thousands more out there suffering though this latest nightmare.	unverifiable
so in summary, a simple disclaimer is all the servicer needs for bankruptcy cases,	unverifiable
the rules you propose still do not protect bankruptcy cases	unverifiable
because the servicer is not required to include a disclaimer so the bankrupt homeowner can keep getting statements.	unverifiable
same with online accounts.	unverifiable
this major servicer has found a loophole and is exploiting it.	unverifiable
here's a suggestion,	unverifiable
maybe you could propose a rule that the servicer shall make a good faith effort to help homeowners with bankruptcies stay in their homes by offering statements with the standard disclosure phrase.	unverifiable
it's sad that i find myself battling a servicer a year after everything was stabilized.	unverifiable
i am tired of fighting.	unverifiable
i think this is a reasonable solution.	unverifiable
homeowners should be able to get answers over the phone,	unverifiable
but then the servicer should be required to ask if they would like a written confirmation of the information.	unverifiable
"of course, the homeowner should say ""yes, please""."	unverifiable
people will not take your opinions seriously if you are derogatory.	unverifiable
the problem with all of this is that the consumer doesn't understand all of the parties involved in his or her loan and might need that information in the case of a financial crisis of some kind.	unverifiable
in addition to the servicer of the loan there is the question of who actually owns the loan	unverifiable
and, if the loan has been bundled into some sort of security, perhaps the borrower should know that as well.	unverifiable
lack of clear records in this regard was exposed as a major problem during the 2008 crisis.	unverifiable
so it seems to me that whenever any change occurs in any of the above, the mortgagee should receive a clear, concise picture of the situation.	unverifiable
a similar form should be sent when there's a change.	unverifiable
each mortgage loan should have a unique universal identifier so things can be tracked properly.	unverifiable
i.e., when a loan is packaged and sold in a structured security, the paperwork would have the unique ids of all loans included in the package.	unverifiable
like children's birthday party magicians regulators halfheartedly attempt to distract their audience with a shiny object in one hand, such as information management proposals, while looking away from the truth of wall street prosecution failure in the other.	unverifiable
"this has become so common place in local hearings and legislative testimony it has spawned new phrases into the english language such as ""regulatory theater"" and ""enforcement fraud""."	non-experiential
i support error correction.	unverifiable
but error correction only corrects errors, not deceptive practices.	non-experiential
a substantive response from the cfpb would have addressed page 27 of the mutli-state lawsuit and advised when homeowners will be able to call their state attorney general or the cfpb to stop a deceptive foreclosure in progress.	unverifiable
homeowner's insurance should have a guaranteed re-issue policy in place for the mortgage servicer.	unverifiable
the rate should be no more than the insurance cost in prior year.	unverifiable
the mortgage servicer should be required to use this guaranteed re-issue policy.	unverifiable
this simple and straightforward change would remove the potential for servicers and insurers to game the system.	unverifiable
i have to disagree with this thoery.	unverifiable
and everyone needs housing.	unverifiable
your proposal does not take into account that the average single home in san francisco is valued well over $300,000.	non-experiential
and perhaps a $300,000 home in your area is a benchmark for the well to do.	unverifiable
but $300,000 is not even a starter home in some areas.	unverifiable
clearly you are not researching	unverifiable
you are a real estate industry stooge intent on confusing regulators.	unverifiable
you confuse valuations  with economic value.	unverifiable
you equate equate lack of government subsidy a punishment.	unverifiable
in the plan proposed if californians made more or had less other expenses such as transportation then there would be a greater house price to subsidize.	unverifiable
however that is not the case in a bubble economy and a real estate market that confuses recent sals prices with economic value.	unverifiable
for the record i am not in the real estate business,	experiential
so your rant is without merit.	unverifiable
and the median home in your area of co  is only $192,000,	non-experiential
how convenient of you to suggest imposing rules on others that would not affect you.	unverifiable
i will not resort to calling you names,	unverifiable
your actions say it all for you.	unverifiable
it looks like you want a debate,	unverifiable
but i'm not interested.	unverifiable
try a debate team or something.	unverifiable
i am in agreement with the form	unverifiable
in this age of the internet, i think there should be a rule requiring mortgage servicing companies to provide access to loan information online.	unverifiable
i currently have a mortgage from a company who does not offer this.	experiential
the rule does not go far enough in terms of protecting the consumer from errors of the bank and allows the bank to put the consumer in a catch22.	unverifiable
my lender errorneously determined that i was in a flood area and despite my protests  that i was not in a flood area went out and bought flood insurance at very high rates.	experiential
it took many hours, calls, and esacalations, and preliminary discussions with attorneys to get the cost of the unnecessary insurance refunded.	experiential
the system leaves consumers poorly defended and allows the bank to buy insurance at extremely high rates.	unverifiable
*  if the insurance was place erroneously the bank has to refund all insurance payments and pay a penalty.	unverifiable
*  the bank should only be allowed to buy insurance at a rate no greater than the leser of -- 10% of competitively priced polices or 10% greater than the rate the homeowner had been paying.	unverifiable
*  the bank should have a time limit on how long it would have to inestigate.	unverifiable
they are also the ones you spoke with every time you called your lender.	unverifiable
i wrote a qwr to my new servicer.	experiential
it took three weekes for them to send an aknowledgement letter back.	experiential
the qwr was perhaps the only tool available to consumers to get information, eliminating it seems counterintuitive of what consumer protection is all about.	unverifiable
i would be skeptical if that claim comes from the servicers.	unverifiable
my qwr asked for a lot of information because the new servicer won't give me anything.	unverifiable
and if you want to protect the consumer you need to strengthen their rights, not weaken them.	unverifiable
the partial payment issue is a tricky one,	unverifiable
they should be required to accept and post partial payments,	unverifiable
becuse it reduces the amount of interest and other charges on the loan especially for fha and other govt backed loans.	unverifiable
their failure to accept partial payments maximizes their insurance claim to the govt.	unverifiable
there is no way this should be allowed,	unverifiable
if you want govt insurance of mortgage loans, then you the lender must accept and post every dollar to that loan before, you would be allowed to make any claim,	unverifiable
any lender not doing that should forfiet their right to make a claim on a govt backed mortgage,	unverifiable
they should have to credit them immediately,	unverifiable
even if there is no negative reporting,	unverifiable
because otherwise they are still engaging in harassing collection calls to borrowers	unverifiable
"i was told i hadn't made a payment even when i had, and that it ""didn't count"" even tho there were 2 months of suspense fund payments present,"	experiential
rather than working to resolve the actual problem, they seem in some cases more interested in getting an insurance claim for your mortgage than curing the default right now	unverifiable
because the claim is worth more than the forclosed property due to market value changes.	unverifiable
as an aside item, most lenders are now calling from the frist day of the grace period,	unverifiable
i studied the example periodic statment 2.	experiential
if a lender will put a partial payment in a suspense account, why can't the lender apply as much of the partial payment as is needed to bring a late payment up-to date.	unverifiable
to hold funds in the suspense account until the full amount is collected and fees are paid still hurts the borrower who is at least trying to catch up.	unverifiable
even paying interest and then the remainder to pricipal on a partial payment helps the borrower catch up.	unverifiable
the lender will benefit from the additional interest on the principal that is paid down more slowly and the late charges.	unverifiable
otherwise, the suspense account should at least pay interest on the funds equal to the interest on the loan so the borrower is not simply out until he or she can catch up completely while still amassing late charges and additional interest.	unverifiable
the portion of the funds that would be alloted to the escrow for taxes and insurance should be applied as well.	unverifiable
those items must be paid anyway	unverifiable
and there is no reason for the bank to add them to the loan amount and charge interest when there was funds to cover them.	unverifiable
perhaps that should be done first.	unverifiable
if adding the breakdown of the escrow payment,as suggested by versability, it might be more informative to show escrow monies received and paid out in the period.	unverifiable
"when there is an escrow for multiple types of payments - insurance, taxes etc - the regulation requires ""aggregate"" accounting that saves consumers money by using a cash flow method."	non-experiential
also, an escrow disclosure is mailed annually that shows the complete breakdown of the escrow account.	non-experiential
yes i do think the timeframes are more realistic.	unverifiable
not really.	unverifiable
the servicer can still invoke any number of vague claims that thwart the borrower from getting information.	unverifiable
i think the extensive list of reasons why a servicer does not have to answer will be used repeatedly.	unverifiable
not in the normal course of business can be invoked on every request, delaying an answer on the first try every time.	unverifiable
the servicers can and will use any weapon that the cfpb hands them.	unverifiable
i am not a lawyer,	experiential
but i see huge holes in these rules.	unverifiable
there's too much emphasis on making sure the servicers are accomodated, at the expense of the borrower.	unverifiable
calling a servicer does not mean you will get an honest answer.	unverifiable
the assumption is the servicer is honest so the rules are proposed this way.	unverifiable
taking away the borrowers only legal means to force a servicer to cooperate is not consumer protection.	unverifiable
please think about this before weakening the consumer's position.	unverifiable
the problem with paperwork was that they never told us what we were supposed to sign	experiential
and they made us send everything in at least 4 times.	experiential
then when we got it all sent in they informed us that they did not hold the  mortgage	experiential
then they said that they were allowed to have the mortgage set at approximately 31% of our income	experiential
and they are supposedly lower then that	experiential
so there was nothing they could or would do.	experiential
they kept giving us a run around and playing telephone tag.	experiential
but they would not call back when you called them.	experiential
it just seems that since we make about $90,000 a year we are just stuck with the payments since we want to keep the house we have to go without so we can make the payments.	experiential
i have read all the previous comments	experiential
i agree that if your lender is not helping you, then you should be able to turn them into someone that can get you some help.	unverifiable
enter the cfpb, they are here to help the consumer	unverifiable
and that is what they should do.	unverifiable
i disagree with the lender not being able to force place insurance on a home.	unverifiable
yes, the deed is in the homeowner's name,	unverifiable
but if the home burns to the ground because the homeowner didn't pay the insurance, what them.	unverifiable
is the bank just supposed to forgive the debt and take just the land,	unverifiable
because that is all that would be left.	unverifiable
and the lender is only supposed to place enough insurance on the loan to cover payoff.	unverifiable
but understand the more burden that is put on the banking industry the more costly loans are going to become.	unverifiable
be careful what you wish for.	unverifiable
i never did see or receive the 'consumer adjustable mortgage rate handbook'.	experiential
unless borrowers are required to tape record every conversation, i fear oral communications only adds miscommunication and could lead to possible deceptive practices.	unverifiable
for example, prior to my foreclosure calling the title co. only four original loan pages could be retrieved to my loan.	experiential
both the local and corporate offices couldn't find documents to my loan.	experiential
it wasn't until after foreclosure did i learn to contact the department of insurance to file a complaint.	experiential
it was then did i receive some specific loan documents requested.	experiential
i later thought to ask how pages related to the loan application are transferred between the broker, loan originator, and title.	experiential
i called title and was told that the only pages kept on file are per the lenders instructions and that they do not keep copies of loan applications on file.	experiential
this was unfortunate to hear	unverifiable
since that was not my question and title had already previously sent me copies of those pages.	experiential
the example may not be directly related to servicers	unverifiable
unfortunately, i do not recommend this.	unverifiable
my intentions upon taking out the loan and putting down 20% was to avoid having to pay a pmi.	experiential
i had no knowledge that a lpmi policy was in place on my loan.	experiential
but the statutory damages under sec 4907 set a maximum of $2,000 in damages.	non-experiential
the costs of the action and attorney fees don't promote any lawful deterrence.	unverifiable
the servicer wrote after my own discovery that no premiums were add to the loan.	experiential
why don't we use a simple, divided insurance formula,	unverifiable
that solves all the force placed insurance problems.	unverifiable
the bank adds the portion for the structure to the monthly house payment, that includes wind if required and flood if in flood zone and any inside flooding.	unverifiable
the home owner is responsible for personal injury, appliances and personal effects and has to send in the money directly.	unverifiable
if the home owner quits making the payment it is irrelevant to the bank that is responsible for sending in the insurance on the structure if they want it protected their investment until foreclosure.	unverifiable
it is considered part of the house payment and the bank is returned to arms length with insurance companies.	unverifiable
the insurance can't adjust more than once every 12 months.	unverifiable
the insurance company has to give the home owner 60 days written notice if there will be an increase in the rate on the homeowner or on the banks side.	unverifiable
because it is in their payment.	unverifiable
the closing agent collects a 6 month reserve at the closing for the bank structure insurance.	unverifiable
if the home owner does not make the payment the the bank forecloses.	unverifiable
that is if the bank has not committed massive fraud or destroyed the documents.	unverifiable
if this is the case, then the bank should have to make the structure payment for years, to teach them a lesson.	unverifiable
oh, when determining the value placed on the home for insuring, it is very important to subtract the value of the land from the purchase price for structure insurance.	unverifiable
the land isn't going anywhere.	unverifiable
jp morgan was servicing my loan for fannie mae.	experiential
i was shocked to learn after my short sale that i was billed almost  $16,000.00 for one month of force placed insurance.	experiential
i was paying state farm less than $300.00 per month for insurance.	experiential
is this racketeering folks or what!!!	unverifiable
"jp morgan billed me under ""escrow shortage"" on their payoff provided to the closing agent."	experiential
the closing agent also collected on the hud 1 for insurance itemized.	experiential
jp morgan then collected the 11 month prorated refund for unused insurance.	experiential
i complained to the sec about how much i was charged, by my jp morgan fannie mae combo.	experiential
jp morgan really shocked me then, they tried to justify their outrageous bill and sent me a copy of another force placed annual policy they placed on my home 2 months after my house sold.	experiential
this explains why my account was left open for 6 months after my house sold with activity in my account.	experiential
i guess if fannie mae can go to the government and ask for 100 billion and get it when ever they want, then their is a massive incentive to run this bill up, not down, if they are sharing in the proceeds.	unverifiable
i can't think of any other alternatives as hard as i try.	unverifiable
no more pay to play, no more back dated insurance, no more over priced insurance where consumers are taken advantage of at the lowest point in their lives, no changing insurance companies after foreclosure is initiated.	unverifiable
by switching servicers every few months to generate prorated refunds on prepaid annual policies is a very big problem	unverifiable
the insurance company can't change after foreclosure is initiated from the homeowners choice	unverifiable
and the policy stays with the note and mortgage until the property sells.	unverifiable
"my friend had three force placed insurance policies in place with over lapping dates after his foreclosure started with each one including the ""successors and assigns""."	experiential
the loan was moved around real fast to generate policies.	experiential
we need a rule here to prevent this.	unverifiable
no moving a loan for servicing after foreclosure begins.	unverifiable
a standard monthly statements for banks should be set up to allow bank investigators to go into the bank and run a report and identify most problems if the software is set up for maximum use.	unverifiable
this asking the banks to tell us what they are doing wrong so they can be punished is not working.	unverifiable
letting the banks pick a friend to investigate them is also a bad option and is slowing our progress.	unverifiable
this is causing the entire country to loose hope and faith.	unverifiable
it is up to bank investigators to do the investigating	unverifiable
and it needs to be easy and efficient using today's technology if we are going to make any progress from this melt down.	unverifiable
please put all the problems on a flow chart and all the solutions on the chart.	unverifiable
get who ever wrote the software for ancestry.com or ebay or us customs that is amazing to write a linked program that solves all the problems.	unverifiable
original land records should be put on the computer for public viewing	unverifiable
and the original documents should be stores at an sec edgar type location until paid in full.	unverifiable
no more changing or disappearing documents.	unverifiable
the solutions are easy.	unverifiable
most problems only have one good solution.	unverifiable
neither party in a real estate transaction should be able to hold the original documents for obvious reasons and their is only one solution.	unverifiable
take the documents away.	unverifiable
no more robo signing, no more missing documents, no more altered documents.	unverifiable
how easy was that to solve three of the worst problems with just take the documents away from the problem.	unverifiable
the answer is both and they should be one in the same.:-	unverifiable
lack of linked cutting edge computer software is the difference.	unverifiable
it is even easie to trace a $1.00 used item sold on ebay after the sale then a current note and mortgage.	unverifiable
i felt like pulling my hair out trying to put together a chain of title with my note and mortgage.	unverifiable
if an investigator went into us customs they could pull up, on the computer, any container arriving in the usa, where it came from, where it went and what was in it.	unverifiable
because us customes has current standard technology and an amazing detailed code system that could be adapted for banking.	unverifiable
you will then be in search of us customs program writers to solve most of your problems.	unverifiable
the banks could use this same system to print a standard monthly report for an individual or company account and maximize transparency for investigators.	unverifiable
example, jp morgan was charging my loan for drive by inspections after my house sold in a short sale.	experiential
so, i know they were not doing the drive by inspections.	unverifiable
the inspector should be able to go into the bank, punch in the drive by inspection code and compare paid out code to billed to customers for drive by inspections with out asking a question and walk out with a report and know to the dollar how bad the problem is in 2 minutes. and ask for proof of payment.	unverifiable
it is important to put all the bank problems on a flow chart first and list all problems and possible solutions .	unverifiable
can't get an answer for and then meet with the best program writer.	unverifiable
to pick one issue, without a comprehensive plan, that solves all computer problems, that need a solution, is a recipe for disaster.	unverifiable
financial disclosures! loan applications must be present an accounted for.	unverifiable
dates and time of process with signature.	unverifiable
borrowers should not go home with copies having no signatures or dates.	unverifiable
large bold type high risk warnings to certain types of loans.	unverifiable
any and all federal and state required forms or brochures from pre-approvals to the closing of the loan.	unverifiable
contact resources to any and every department that has oversight or jurisdiction over lending.	unverifiable
any other disputed rights. should forever be monitored, addressed, and updated by the cfpb for the borrowers to access and review.	unverifiable
but i also don't believe borrowers are making unreasonable requests.	unverifiable
oh, yes!	unverifiable
but there many examples of lending forms shown over the internet.	unverifiable
for example, i'm looking for a form called the 1008 transmittal summary.	experiential
the vice president of title said they don't know what that form is but will call when they find it.	experiential
that was over a year ago.	experiential
my last letter from the servicer wrote back.	experiential
pursuant to 12 usc 2605 sec, the information that may be obtained on a loan under a qwr is specifically limited to information relating to the servicing of such loan... includes a statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower, to the extent applicable, that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.	non-experiential
"i challenged the ""other information sought by the borrower"" trying to gain access to original documents in relation to my loan."	experiential
my servicer says they do not intend to waive their rights to other various documents sought by the borrower.	experiential
so, access to original loan approval documents are impossible to access since the loan originator is no longer in business.	unverifiable
consumers finding themselves financially strapped in these predatory or deceptive practices can not become overnight legal experts on law	unverifiable
"i've contacted and filed a complaint with every office in this country and wound up with a response stating, "" thank you for informing us but there's nothing we can do. go find a lawyer."""	experiential
moderator i can show you documents where the account number has been changed on things like over lapping force placed insurance policies for example.	unverifiable
when loans change hands to generate expenses you see this.	unverifiable
"i am saying your ""periodic statement"" should have the same originating lender code followed by the account number that was assigned at closing on every statement."	unverifiable
"there should be a government place to ""report an error"" if your account number has been altered or changed."	unverifiable
as you seem genuinely interested in this project i would like to send you my case	unverifiable
and you will see  that there are so many issues that need fixing relating to the big picture.	unverifiable
why fix a few things when you can fix them all.	unverifiable
it's time for national standards	unverifiable
as there is not enough staff to investigate individual banks on every corner with a different system in each one.	unverifiable
and the problems will change instead of improve as new rules are implemented.	unverifiable
i know this has nothing to do with the subject at hand.	unverifiable
but, i wish that the cornell university law school would get involved and figure out why the supreme court won't shut down mers as it is a national problem and the courts are ruling differently in each state, making solving the banking problems worse.	unverifiable
maybe cornell can change banking like the students changed egypt! :-	unverifiable
not only do they claim that they have no affiliation with the originator and that they only purchased the servicing rights.	unverifiable
after the borrower from frustration gives up and enters into default the servicer just calls themselves a debt collector.	unverifiable
the fair debt collection practices act does seem to provide added protection for borrowers.	unverifiable
but i'm concerned when the servicer becomes a debt collector.	unverifiable
at the time i wasn't in default my servicer already classed itself as a debt collector. as shown in this video.	experiential
the servicer stated over the phone that it was their policy to deny online access and not provide statements to anyone with a bankruptcy discharge unless the loan is reaffirmed.	experiential
i just recieved a response to my direct complaint to the servicer.	experiential
"they state in writing ""please be advised that our records indicate that your account has gone through a bankruptcy that has been discharged."	experiential
"if you have any questions please contact our bankruptcy department"""	experiential
as you can see they are trying to use the statements as leverage to obtain a reaffirmation.	unverifiable
i'd go so far as to call it blackmail.	unverifiable
they imply that it is because of bankruptcy laws, and that is what they have told others on the complaint blogs.	unverifiable
but because i have proven it is not a violation against the bankruptcy code,	unverifiable
then this is simply a mean-spirited internal policy the servicer uses to abuse those who have gone through bankruptcy.	unverifiable
here is your opportunity to stand up for the borrower and make the servicer rescind it's abusive policy.	unverifiable
require servicers to provide periodic statements to all borrowers including loans discharged in bankruptcy.	unverifiable
it is not a violation of the bankruptcy code, in fact this is clearly addressed as it pertains to creditors and principal residences of the debtors.	unverifiable
another case in point.	unverifiable
the only way to get them to move toward assisting is to hire an attorney to sue.	unverifiable
we did that with our last home.	experiential
our loan was eventually sold to countrywide.	experiential
we had no say in the matter.	experiential
ok!  everyone of us has similar problems and are trying to do the right thing.	unverifiable
"when does the government ""bail"" us out."	unverifiable
the banks already have theirs.	unverifiable
let's organize.	unverifiable
now is the time.	unverifiable
all banks are required to give you a simple form when you apply for the loan.	unverifiable
it states that the bank will sell your loan, the bank will service your loan and does not intend to sell your loan, or the bank can sell your loan.	unverifiable
if you don't want your loan sold, tell them.	unverifiable
if they will not change, go somewhere else.	unverifiable
you did have a say when you signed that form.	unverifiable
do away with coupon books.	unverifiable
they allow for shoddy service and harmful practices.	unverifiable
for 30 months i used a coupon book to pay my mortgage with boa.	experiential
consequently, i could not see how my payments were allocated and how the principal was affected.	experiential
my new servicer, by contrast, sends a monthly statement that details payment allocation and principal balance as of previous statement.	experiential
to compare allocations between old and new servicer, i requested a payment history  from the old servicer.	experiential
since february 2012 i have been trying to get an explanation.	experiential
"all i have gotten to date from bank representatives is: ""forget about the printed record; trust us, payments were allocated correctly."""	experiential
contacting the cfpb has been no help.	unverifiable
as a sole complainant, it seems that i am not worth the bother.	unverifiable
yet, if this happened to me, conceivably it could happen to anyone who makes payment with a coupon book.	unverifiable
* for most small to mid-size lenders the actual statements are outsourced to a third party due to the cost of creating something in house.	unverifiable
therefore the ability to change the format of a statement is not only limited but very expensive.	unverifiable
in a time of ever shrinking margins  this is a cost that just cannot be easily absorbed.	unverifiable
* if the cfpb is going to require changes to a statement they should create a safe harbor format to shield fi's from being sued by lawyers looking to make money and not protect consumers.	unverifiable
as someone who has been in the industry for well over a quarter i can give some insight here.	experiential
for a small to midsize lender the mortgages will often be stored on a system that is not connected in real time to your core processing system.	unverifiable
this would prevent someone from being able to view their mortgage on their home banking page.	unverifiable
it's not meant to be secretive	unverifiable
but it is just a fact that different computer systems often do not communicate with each other.	unverifiable
i am against having oral and written requests being treated equally.	unverifiable
written requests have, by their nature, a more formal stature and create a paper trail.	unverifiable
"an oral request will create a ""he said, she said"" conflict."	unverifiable
as for safe harbor some other regs specifically state if a fi uses that format they are protected from liability.	unverifiable
the cfpb should do the same.	unverifiable
having spent so long dealing with vendors i do not anticipate a cost savings.	unverifiable
"if anything, i can see a ""compliance surcharge"" being added.  """	unverifiable
a rule is not a rule once you start making exceptions.	unverifiable
ultimately, entities for which the exception was not intended find a way to exploit it.	unverifiable
moderator, steve smith made a great point that is related to insurance and is another example of the narrow scope of the questions, that you have to work with.	unverifiable
your success level with this program will be based on embracing the issues that are relevant and important that are being ignored, like the point steve made.	unverifiable
ultimately, the consumer pays for pmi.	unverifiable
if pmi is required, then the home owner should be able to  shop for the best rate.	unverifiable
banks need to be removed from insurance where it appears they commit massive fraud so banks will  return to focusing on loaning money.	unverifiable
the home owner should shop for the pmi best rate to protect their loan because ultimately they are paying for it.	unverifiable
the homeowner should shop for the best price they can find on structure insurance based on replacement value of the structure including wind or hurricane or flood or fire or water damage, on a need basis and subtract the value of the land for replacement insurance.	unverifiable
structure and pmi insurance is considered part of the monthly house payment just like interest and principle.	unverifiable
this keeps what is mandatory to secure a loan to a minimum so homes will not be lost due to over priced insurance any longer.	unverifiable
nobody should loose their home because they are paying for optional items either.	unverifiable
there is an easy solution for this.	unverifiable
and it is a separate policy.	unverifiable
basically moderator, separating minimum priced mandatory bank insurance from optional insurance is crucial and could make the difference from making a house payment or not.	unverifiable
mandatory insurance should be in the name of the bank and homeowner.	unverifiable
optional insurance should be in the home owners name and paid directly from the home owner to the insurance company if they can afford optional insurance.	unverifiable
the bank sends in the payment every month for pmi and structure insurance.	unverifiable
no more prepaid annual policies to generate prorated refunds by switching servicers.	unverifiable
it is important to stop this game, and only allowed structure insurance for the bank.	unverifiable
the most important thing in this paragraph is the importance of separating mandatory insurance, from optional insurance.	unverifiable
it is crucial to get the price of insurance as low as possible to prevent a lot of unnecessary foreclosures.	unverifiable
it's time to remove bank greed and fraud from property insurance.	unverifiable
it's time to return banks to loaning money.	unverifiable
it was time 4 years ago.	unverifiable
i am but one consumer, one data point, and hesitant to extrapolate my experience into public policy proposals.	unverifiable
but arms are indeed confusing,	unverifiable
and there is a great variety of types of arms.	unverifiable
my experience is that a mortgage servicer will seek to interpret an arm's language to its greatest benefit.	unverifiable
one way this is done, in my experience, is to incorrectly calculate an interest rate at a change date.	unverifiable
i would be happy to see another error added to better address interest rate disputes,	unverifiable
as this may well be one type of deceptive practice the industry employs.	unverifiable
* the regulation should only apply to banks that sell loans and only on the loans that are sold.	unverifiable
* almost all new regulations require training for all employees,	unverifiable
which is expensive and unnecessary.	unverifiable
99% of all banks want to comply with all laws and regulations.	non-experiential
it is either the expense involved or the misunderstanding of the reg. that causes them not to be in compliance.	unverifiable
i am required to have three exteral audits done at my bank now.	experiential
there is no reason this regulation cannot be short, simple, and easy to comply with.	unverifiable
if you need help with it, call me.	unverifiable
i personally think all banks should keep and service all mortgage loans they make,	unverifiable
but then people that can't afford to buy houses whould not get too.	unverifiable
moderator, maybe the government could buy one less military plane and fund this program.	unverifiable
the american people are not afraid that iran or russia are going to bomb their homes.	unverifiable
the american people are afraid of the banks that are already here, that collapsed the economy and are taking advantage of them now, by inflating the fees and then stealing their homes with fake document by hiring a slimy attorney.	unverifiable
they are living with fear and anxiety	unverifiable
because their chain of title has been destroyed with mers and the banks are killing their homes values and stable neighborhoods are turning into rental neighborhoods with run down homes deserted with expensive insurance on them to fix them up	unverifiable
but it is not being used, just billed.	unverifiable
this system would be a lot cheaper than a plane and would save a lot more families from destruction.	unverifiable
it is sad, that something as complex as this situation is being handled in such a fragmented way with little progress in 4 years.	unverifiable
the most important advise i can ever give you for all your questions is the need to start with a flow chart of all the problems and possible solutions.	unverifiable
the fact that this has never been done is appalling!	unverifiable
please have a department at your school take this project on even if nobody asks except for me.	unverifiable
i can fill up your chart.	unverifiable
you have to really know what the problems are in there entirety before the correct solution can even be found.	unverifiable
any thing else is just putting the cart before the horse.	unverifiable
process of elimination after viewing the entire problem will always lead to the best solution.	unverifiable
there needs to be a second chart from the flow chart that shows which government agency is responsible for implementing the solutions.	unverifiable
next, these government agencies need to meet monthly by video conference and present their progress and their goals for the following month.	unverifiable
you know the accountability thing.	unverifiable
we don't have a good system for investigating the banks is the main problem.	unverifiable
this is what lead to your limited questions in the first place and the reason we are emailing each other.	unverifiable
an employee insider that has experienced one of these bank investigations left an interesting blog on your site that explains their process first hand.	unverifiable
your questions are too narrow to address most of the issues my case exposes that need addressing.	unverifiable
steve you have posted an excellent example of how people continue to get the run around.	unverifiable
one of the reasons the servicers or debt collectors seem to not care is because really they are not obligated to the borrower.	unverifiable
the servicer has a contract and a fiduciary duty to the investor.	non-experiential
the borrower is an account the servicer manages on the behalf of the investor.	non-experiential
they view us as accounts.	unverifiable
the servicer does not have a fiduciary duty to the borrower,	non-experiential
so they really do not care about anything except the revenue the account  provide.	unverifiable
the caveat is that the investor wants the account to keep paying,	unverifiable
but the system is designed to bring more revenue to the servicer if the borrower is late or in default.	unverifiable
so getting the servicer to provide information about the investor is like pulling teeth.	unverifiable
the servicers guard this information because they do not want the borrower to tell the investor what is going on...	unverifiable
the wording does not get it right.	unverifiable
when our family went through this, the people representing the lender told us:	experiential
don't worry about arm's, you can always refinance later	experiential
of course, once the collapse hit, refinancing became not an option for many.	experiential
"the wording should specifically say something like: ""warning: you may not be able to refinance later, so you should expect to have to make the higher rate payments later"""	unverifiable
i don't understand how paying an insurance policy for a non-escrow loan is so difficult.	unverifiable
you know the process already because you're obviously already doing it for escrow loans.	unverifiable
i'm not seeing the difficulty in providing the same service to non-escrow customers.	unverifiable
the systems are clearly in place by your own admission.	non-experiential
you're just adding more volume, so hire a few more people.	unverifiable
...so hire a few more people.	unverifiable
we operate on a razor thin margin.	unverifiable
"if i hired ""a few more people"" for every regulation i would lose money and no longer be in business."	unverifiable
a credit union is a not for profit enterprise but it cannot lose money and remain in business.	unverifiable
second, while a data base is in place for escrow accounts no such system exists for non-escrow accounts.	non-experiential
go back and read my post.	unverifiable
once insurance is force placed things go downhill very quickly and the chance of my getting paid back is slim to none.	unverifiable
even if i could find out who to pay i am not going to misuse the credit union's funds to pay for additional riders on a homeowner's policy.	unverifiable
here is a real world example which will illustrate why this proposed rule is unfair.	unverifiable
i am a mortgage originator and loan servicer.	experiential
i hold all the loans i make.	experiential
i have a customer who has stopped making payments on his account.	experiential
he is 6 months past due on his loan and has refused to make contact with us.	experiential
he is in foreclosure.	experiential
i escrow for his taxes and his insurance.	experiential
he has a large shortage in his escrow account.	experiential
his homeowner's renewal is due on october 23, 2012.	experiential
the renewal premium is $1,398.00.	experiential
the proposed rule would require that i pay his insurance premium from his escrow account	experiential
even though he does not have enough money in his escrow account to cover the premium.	experiential
i can write forced placed insurance to cover my interest in his property for $460.	experiential
yes, the insurance is inadequate for his needs,	experiential
but it is perfectly adequate for my needs.	experiential
this proposed rule implies that even if the borrower has stopped paying the loan, i as the mortgage holder and loan servicer have a responsibility to protect the borrower, no matter how much money it will cost me.	unverifiable
in today's world it could take years to finally take back a property.	unverifiable
this rule would require me to pay the borrower's policy premium for 2, 3 or even 4 years, even though i could protect my interest in his property for 1 or 3 the cost.	unverifiable
of course, at any time, the borrower can call the insurance agent, cancel the policy and receive the refund, a refund of my money, not his.	unverifiable
this is not the way the our american system is designed to function.	unverifiable
i know that the public is angry and wants to make wells fargo and bank of america pay for everything, as retribution for the mortgage meltdown.	unverifiable
but small mortgage holders like myself are being forced to pay for the sins of others.	unverifiable
the rule is unfair to me and is simply wrong, based upon how our american system of economics functions.	unverifiable
i strongly recommend that the cfpb rethink its rule and implement a new rule which requires the mortgage servicer to inform the borrower of the situation and give the borrower the opportunity to take responsibility for himself, as i have outlined above.	unverifiable
your arguments make no sense.	unverifiable
as an expert in the loan tracking industry, i can 100% indisputably tell you that there is no extra cost whatsoever to treating a non-escrow and an escrow loan the same.	non-experiential
you're flat out lying,	unverifiable
and i have to call you out.	unverifiable
i've worked in every loan tracking system,	experiential
and i'd be more than happy to consult your supposed credit union on how to accomplish this at absolutely no cost.	unverifiable
otherwise i'd thank you to stop lying in this forum,	unverifiable
"if you are, then you're self insuring, and you're actually not serving your own needs"" since you'd be the one paying out the insurance."	unverifiable
that makes no sense.	unverifiable
you're going to be paying the premium one way or the other.	unverifiable
if you want to call the insurance company to cancel some of the coverages or add the insurance cost to the borrower's loan, that's the purpose of an escrow account,	unverifiable
and if they default, you're insured against that by the investor.	unverifiable
once again, your real world example holds no water.	unverifiable
3 in every case, it is always cheaper and better for everyone involved to have the preferred voluntary policy continued rather than placing a force-placed policy.	unverifiable
you're not being forced out of anything.	unverifiable
....and so ends any attempt at civility.	unverifiable
"really, there is no need to lob ""three score barrels of powder"" at me."	unverifiable
these rules will be tough on a small lending firm.	unverifiable
the consumer needs to take responsibility for his actions.	unverifiable
there are just too many regulations.	unverifiable
although some of these regulations are burdensome, email notification and communication is paramount in this age.	unverifiable
my servicer does not allow me to communicate via email which makes record keeping difficult for me - unilateral for them since the conversations are recorded.	unverifiable
"to maintain clear information that will prevent people from being  ""overwhelmed"" with fraud would require the bank to give the home owner a choice of servicers at closing. just like when you buy a computer you pick your service provider."	unverifiable
for a servicer to change 4 times in a year, to create multiple annual forceplaced insurance policies, is abuse!	unverifiable
"your servicing should not be traded like a stock because, well it's stupid, leads to fraud and leads to people being ""overwhelmed"" for no reason."	unverifiable
the banks have proven they are way too irresponsible to make this decision for homeowners.	unverifiable
it is important that if a house has gone into foreclosure that the payoff information remains the responsibility of the lender not the attorney taking care of the foreclosure.	unverifiable
this is very important because i got a payoff from both the servicer and the attorney to see what would happen, in florida.	experiential
there was close to  a $10,000.00 difference in payoff statements.	experiential
i have proof.	experiential
the servicer still needs to provide service and be held accountable for the accuracy.	unverifiable
"the fbi has determined that florida is one of the worst states for mortgage fraud and with over 90,000 attorneys in florida the florida bar revokes very close to ""0"" licenses."	non-experiential
so, leaving an attorney responsible for payoffs is a risk that is not necessary to take	unverifiable
and i don't think it should be allowed.	unverifiable
moderator, i think the list of reasons that the servicer does not have to respond is open for abuse and continual stalling.	unverifiable
most information that consumers ask for or need are just a few keystrokes away for the servicer,	unverifiable
but they make it difficult if not impossible for consumers to access that information.	unverifiable
i hope the new rules will bring relief to homeowners,	unverifiable
but right now the servicers have no real obligations or duties to the homeowners.	unverifiable
the entire mortgage servicing system is flawed from the start.	unverifiable
i appreciate the financial difficulties small servicers may face.	unverifiable
however there are options e.g. subservicing,  which can lower cost, improve service and comply with the proposed regulations.	unverifiable
if customer service is the goal then the size of servicer should not be a criteria as there are small servicers that do not provide adequate service.	unverifiable
a single point of contact needs to be as described; and needs to be cross-trained to provide real and accurate answers.	unverifiable
if an answer is not available, the spoc needs to follow up with the client in a reasonable time to provide an answer to their questions.	unverifiable
often times clients are assigned to a spoc that is unable to assist them, and does not have accurate updates.	unverifiable
another problem is that often times even though a spoc exists, other account reps from various departments at the same servicer  continue to contact or send letters to the client which confuses them as to which documents have been received, what needs to be provided, and what the status is.	unverifiable
for example, a client was approved for a trial mod	experiential
but after signing and returning her documents, she received a notice from another department stating that she needed to provide documents for an approval.	experiential
then when she called that department the account manager said they didn't receive the documents that she had signed and overnighted to them, and had no notes regarding the approval.	experiential
at that time i told her to contact her poc  and verify that everything had been received and approved...	experiential
it had.	experiential
it was an internal error which caused more stress on the client,	unverifiable
and i have witnessed it happening many times to many clients.	experiential
i don't have time to address each category individually, so i want to make a plea here for common sense!	unverifiable
while there may be legitimate reasons for delays or missing information, oftentimes obfuscation and complicating tactics mean there are things they don't want you to know, or they hope you will just go away.	unverifiable
this happens in many industries--health insurance is a good one.	unverifiable
if the government's job is to facilitate commerce, and also prevent fraud, both could be served by simply requiring mortgage businesses to behave transparently.	unverifiable
it's the old golden rule applied to business!	unverifiable
if they won't agree they should have a legitimate explanation or be denied the opportunity.	unverifiable
what about people like my husband and i who had multiple circumstances causing financial issues,	experiential
we request a loan mod. and the lender and attorney we hired said the lender will not even begin to negoiate with us until we where behind on our mortgage, something we where not.	experiential
long story short i have the proof they said it all documents covering my hiney and i am 1 year out of short sale and started the whole this in 2007 and due to all the non-contact and screwup's we just finalized it sept, 2011	experiential
our credit was perfect before and after only the one problem due to bad legal advice.	experiential
we are now trying to buy a home and cannot get a loan with less than 6.7% for 20 years and we have 700 credit scores, with 20% down not to mention everything we paid off and no minimual credit cards.	experiential
i have gone to 3 banks ,	experiential
im told to get a good rate it has to be 2 years and i already have one gone.	experiential
they wont even consider the extenuating circumstances.	experiential
25 years in law enforcement and perm disability guarnteed income and still have to wait 1 year.	experiential
i need to find a company that does better than the others,	unverifiable
its a no brainer we  are  a great investment.	unverifiable
pass on any help you can i need it.	unverifiable
also i have stacks of documents showing they lost my paperwork ,	experiential
some comments are , they cannot find it ,	experiential
then its been given to collections,	experiential
which there was no reason for that,	unverifiable
"then every other time they would misplace ""lose"" my documents, then switch peole and they loose it."	experiential
i have the conversations where the realtor and the rep at the bank tell each other they lost my stuff ,	experiential
"also the documentation and notes from the attorney we paid to ""help"" us they marked down man times that there is a hold up do to misplaced papers"	experiential
what do you do when all you wanted was a loan modification and chase would not discuss or negoiate with us until we where behind in our payments, and the attorney we hired to help us told us we had to stop making payment before they could do anything	unverifiable
and i still cant find a decent interest rate.	unverifiable
6.75% for 20 years just because i have 1 year left.	experiential
my credit is perfect besides that	unverifiable
someone help me!	unverifiable
yes, i think it is feasible to expect servicers to make the accommodation of having a spoc for all outbound and inbound communications with clients and housing counselors, and that they are able to answer questions , and have direct contact with underwriters .	unverifiable
it would be ideal if housing counselors were able to have direct communication with underwriters and eliminate the third person in between which would also be more cost effective due to a reduction in communication problems, time, and the amount of re-dos because of inaccurate rejection issues.	unverifiable
i agree britt,	unverifiable
this information belongs to the consumer.	unverifiable
forcing a querant into discovery is unfair, expensive and very often a lengthy process.	unverifiable
the burden should not be on the consumer to retrieve all information in their mortgage file.	unverifiable
to do less not only harms the consumer it harms the public records.	unverifiable
stop negotiating with these banks,	unverifiable
force the banks to organize their records and reconcile them with the registries.	unverifiable
enough already.	unverifiable
"i disagree with the ""send it back to the borrower"" idea."	unverifiable
this does not make sense and does not benefit the borrower.	unverifiable
this will only incur late fees to the benefit of the servicers.	unverifiable
the borrower should be able to send payments to the old servicer up to 60 days after the transfer date without fear that the payment will not be applied.	unverifiable
the borrower should only be concerned with making the payment on time.	unverifiable
the old and new servicer are already in a contractual agreement, so tranferring the payment from the old servicer to the new servicer is a simple electronic transaction.	unverifiable
it is applied on the same day the old servicer recieves the payment from the borrower.	non-experiential
so this talk about sending payments back to the borrower is detrimental to the borrower,	unverifiable
this is against the entire purpose of the cfpb protecting the borrower.	unverifiable
do not send payments back to the borrower!	unverifiable
the old and new servicer shall implement policies and procedures to ensure the payment is posted correctly by either servicer.	unverifiable
here is another force placed insurance problem that is not being addressed with the current force placed insurance solution.	unverifiable
"the current solution, which is a ""warning"" to the borrower that will some how prevent force placed insurance."	unverifiable
because the homeowner can not make their property insurance payment, because of lack of funds, the bank is going to highly inflate the insurance, is some how the current solution.	unverifiable
this makes the problem worse and is not a solution but another problem.	unverifiable
i have linked the following problem because i'm surprised this problem is not all over the web.	unverifiable
i would guess this ladies problem was probably created because the banks collapsed the market after running the market up with artificial demand leaving her upside down.	unverifiable
this lady's house is now worth $59,000.	experiential
she owes $84,000 on the house.	experiential
her insurance company will not insure her home for  more than it is worth.	unverifiable
so her lender put a force placed insurance policy on her for $84,000 instead of the difference is her complaint,	experiential
this is so sad, and needs a solution.	unverifiable
this board needs transparency and versability because we will tell them what they have wrong and right based on personal experience.	unverifiable
"please do not tell me ""0""."	unverifiable
i love elizabeth warren and the cfpb	unverifiable
and i want this program to be hugely successful,	unverifiable
because it is our only hope, for bank reform and is the only reason that i am sending you some of my suggestions that fall under the scope of your questions.	unverifiable
24 cfr 3500.17 should be amended to explicitly prohibit collection of an amount greater than that needed to pay taxes and insurance.	unverifiable
account cushion at all times.	unverifiable
this equates to an interest free loan to the servicer for the life of the loan.	unverifiable
and chase threatened to foreclose after admitting the money was not needed to pay the impounds.	unverifiable
i would be happy to share my lenghthy correspondence with chase over this.  i then refinanced.	experiential
failure to pay impound expenses:  a prior lender, bank of america let my homeowners' insurance lapse -- despite collecting the money, and my forwarding 3 notices that the insurance would be, and then was being cancelled for non-payment.	experiential
after it was cancelled, b of a said that i would have to pay to reinstate,	experiential
and they would eventually reimburse me.	experiential
there needs to be a penalty for every time this occurs.	unverifiable
i refinanced.	experiential
i am concerned about underwriters being overwhelmed by calls from clients and understand how difficult it is to constantly be interrupted while trying to review detailed information...	unverifiable
however; the reps also interrupt the underwriters to find out information for clients and counselors	unverifiable
so it wastes time adding a 3rd person to the mix when the information at hand is critical to the decision making process.	unverifiable
i don't think the average turn around time for evaluation decisions is accurate.	unverifiable
so they are able to accurately complete the evaluation.	unverifiable
instead, clients must re-apply from the beginning which wastes time that could be spent on new client applications, and prolongs the foreclosure process.	unverifiable
my suggestion would be for clients to have a spoc for both inbound and outbound communication, and for the housing counselors to have direct contact with underwriters with the understanding that housing counselors will be contacted for any needed information or decisions before client files are closed in order to avoid declines based upon missing information, misunderstandings, or the reasons stated previously.	unverifiable
in response to the exclusions mentioned in  and the process of updating borrowers, i recommend it to be updated as so...	unverifiable
"in any event, where the servicing of a mortgage is transferred, sold, assigned, and or or other from the original mortgagee that will change any information pertaining to the payments of a consumer loan, the servicer must provide the ""updating borrower"" letter regardless of how the servicing is contracted."	non-experiential
it shall be the responsibility of the mortgagee that decides to sell the servicing rights, to create a documented trail of the transaction that is visible to consumers and provide any or all methods available to the consumer that ensures all payments are directed to the appropriate department, company, contractor, affiliate and or or other that will provide services on the behalf of the original mortgagee.	unverifiable
my point is simple,	unverifiable
and i understand that added stress on the company,	unverifiable
but as much is added to the consumer.	unverifiable
as mentioned in the time frame allocated to such a transfer, 15 days in my eyes is short and should be at least 30-45 days.	unverifiable
"why, simple...most mortgagor's pay their mortgages ""once every month"","	unverifiable
so what is happening is that the burden of making an adjustment in 15 days is left to the mortgagor	unverifiable
which is unreasonable.	unverifiable
"as a mortgagor, i would ""always investigate"" any or all changes to who recieves my payments,"	unverifiable
and 15 days is just not sufficient.	unverifiable
so, to resolve the issue, extend the notice time to 30and days,	unverifiable
and should the mortgagor continue to make the payment to the old servicer,	unverifiable
pick up the phone	unverifiable
and make contact with your client, as you have profitted from his or her payments.	unverifiable
in addition, a letter explaining that any future payments must be made to the new servicing company to avoid additonal penalties being assessed to your account...basically 2 letters and a phone call to those that didnt get it or do not understand.	unverifiable
"periodic statements... unless you want to get paid ""peridocially"" you should send consumers  ""monthly statements""...therefore collecting your payment every time you send a statement."	unverifiable
we are talking about mortgages, if not the largest, surely one of the largest investments consumers will make	unverifiable
and we see how connected it is to our global economy,	unverifiable
as soon as the little guy is not making payments, the world practically collapses.	unverifiable
it is vital, to not only mortgages, but to any business...	unverifiable
you should always maintain a connection with your clients to ensure your relationship is one of good standing that will continue for many years to come.	unverifiable
as to the itemization, i find it surprising that not all servicers provide this detail of consumers accounts.	unverifiable
if the servicer does not know about the itemization and current standing of the consumers account, well then they need to apply some sort of system that allows them to maintain these records...	unverifiable
asking the consumer to pay for it, is just ridiculous.	unverifiable
this is similar as to asking a local community, to pay for the construction, permits, taxes, infastructure and other costs to open a mcdonalds on the corner.	unverifiable
yes, i might like thier burgers,	unverifiable
yes it might be convenient right down the street,	unverifiable
when the government required fast foods to contain a nutrition label, i didnt get a call from mcdonalds saying, since you eat here, we need to charge you x so that i can continue to accept your business.	unverifiable
the burden of being compliant is always on the one providing the services or products in exchange for profits.	unverifiable
in response to info...it should be the standard practice to all businesses...	unverifiable
the better informed your client is , the better your relationship or the better chances of you  getting paid.	unverifiable
as described in the fraud act 2006... fraud by failing to disclose information.	non-experiential
a person is in breach of this section if he-	non-experiential
bintends, by failing to disclose the information- .	non-experiential
ito make a gain for himself or another, or .	non-experiential
"simply said, it is considered fraud to not provide ""info""."	non-experiential
if your collecting payments for the next 30 years , info associated with the account it is surely part of the business obligation.	unverifiable
to close, if at any point, your client  is at risk of not making payments, it surely becomes your duty to protect the contract by offering solutions...	unverifiable
"or in this case ""info""."	unverifiable
when...is surely tough when crediting an account when payments are inconsistant and completely understand the complexity of the matter when providing up to date information to the client in a timely manner .	unverifiable
as i feel there is no one answer that conforms to all needs...i feel what is important is creating an incentive that encourages most people to act, ultimatelty streamlining most of whatever process.	unverifiable
in the past, consumers where offered discounts on the mtg interest  if you signed up for electronic payments.	non-experiential
as they say in the service business, different strokes for different folks.	unverifiable
and that should be up to company and or or its affiliates.	unverifiable
surely a tough situation for both ends.	unverifiable
i would add though, it is to often that computers become unreliable therefore making paperless accounting very risky.	unverifiable
i know that saving trees is extremely important, but buyer beware with anything electronic.	unverifiable
in todays age, an area that works along side with an electronic system is identity theft and viruses.	non-experiential
it is just as improtant, should you decide to go paperless, make sure you print a receipt...because the burden of proof is on the consumer, not the organization!	unverifiable
i understand the lender or servicer's fears that the integrity or independence of a review may be compromised by the coaching of clients by their underwriters;	unverifiable
however, that is not what i was implying,	unverifiable
and i doubt it would be an issue as the underwriters are working for the servicers, not the clients;	unverifiable
so underwriters would have no incentive to coach clients.	unverifiable
yes, in a perfect world housing counselors would catch all errors,	unverifiable
so we are coming in during the middle of the process.	unverifiable
2 examples of avoidable denials based upon obvious errors which could have been corrected...	unverifiable
a client was denied due to an obvious miscalculation in the expense column of her rma;	unverifiable
another client was denied because although she wrote a detailed explanation of her hardship, she did not check the hardship box.	unverifiable
i believe the transferring servicer should not be allowed to contact the borrower subsequent to the transfer date for any reason.	unverifiable
if contact is necessary such as to follow up on an nsf the new servicer should be required to make the contact on behalf of the old servicer.	unverifiable
any requests to borrower to send another payment, for example, should come from the new servicer	unverifiable
this will ensure that the borrower will not get caught up in a dispute between services.	unverifiable
consumers should have access to their information whenever they need it.	unverifiable
ultimately it should be up to clients if they want to receive periodic statements in the mail; would rather have them emailed; or want neither, but are able to request a statement when it is needed.	unverifiable
there are plenty of primative inexpensive software programs available to small businesses.	unverifiable
small servicers should not be exempt from sending periodic statements if the client requests them, but should be allowed to solicit their clients for waivers or alternatives to save money.	unverifiable
"because of your lack of education on the acts that now govern and control how you or your organization works with consumers, let it be a ""demo"" of what happens with you make exceptions."	unverifiable
based on the safe act...i will say, maybe a long shot...but, you are not a licensed mlo, maybe just registered...	unverifiable
and if an executive of the bank, you did not even submit a background check or credit report.	non-experiential
thats impossible!	unverifiable
as a fairly tech savy person and experinced programmer, though my screen may be designed differently, with different buttons or colors, it does not affect data.	non-experiential
the data is consistent regardless of computer or screen or access...	non-experiential
it just might be aranged differently,	unverifiable
fine, okay...but one guy has 8 payments on your account	non-experiential
and the other guy has 36 payments on your account,	non-experiential
this is just unrealistic to the purpose of maintaining data.	unverifiable
simple solution, if you have a database and are considering a servicer or subservicer or whatever...create a restricted and secure access point to only specific information for this contractor so that the information is consistant on your screen aswell as on the contractors screen	unverifiable
"you see this now with almost everything, credit card companies, power companies, almost anyone that has adopted ""payonline"" options, has these access points for account holders"	unverifiable
...again, i cant believe this is even a problem!	unverifiable
"surely push ""good information management"" through, its a no brainer."	unverifiable
i agree britt.	unverifiable
i believe the intent of the consumer is to retrieve all internal comments .	unverifiable
all of this information belongs to the consumer.	unverifiable
oral testimony mean zip, zilch, nothing in the context of servicer abuse.	unverifiable
less than zero.	unverifiable
i am going to have to disagree with mpick76.	unverifiable
banks use depositers money to lend.	non-experiential
in addition, files that qualify for sale on the secondary markets are sold in order to create liquidity...	non-experiential
therefore, now they have the cash to lend again.	non-experiential
banks charge fees  to create the loan, plus collect a premium on the sale of the loan due to the projected value over the next 30 years of payment.	non-experiential
all banks or lenders need to be held to the same regs regardless of size,	unverifiable
and if you have anyone handeling loans, they should conform to the safe act	unverifiable
which right now, banks  are not, because thier loan officers are not required to tested.	non-experiential
it is impossible for anyone to know the law unless your obligated to comply.	unverifiable
i can only say one name...washington mutual.	unverifiable
and they were a bank .	unverifiable
problem: every place where there is not transparency in lending there is fraud.	unverifiable
solution: all account activity directly and indirectly in your account has to be on the monthly statement addressing companies by name not category.	unverifiable
"problem: ""depending on circumstances"""	unverifiable
solution: no, all circumstances	unverifiable
"problem: ""the servicer would not have to respond to requests that come more than 1 year after the loan is paid off."	unverifiable
solution: no time limit to expose mortgage abuse.	unverifiable
problem: allowing servicers to charge for information on your account.	unverifiable
this is not an alicart restaurant.	non-experiential
this should not be an issue if the homeowner had escrow for insurance.	unverifiable
the servicer should pay the original insurer.	unverifiable
notice should be sent to the homeowner that the policy was paid on every anniversary with the name of the insurance company.	unverifiable
we have submitted 5 complaints to the new york state banking dept. of homeowners who received forced placed insurance that was 5 times more than the policy on record.	experiential
when a servicing transfer is done, insurance information is rarely transferred alongside the mortgage information, despite the fact that it is often the same insurance tracker that acts as both loan servicers.	non-experiential
because of this, many borrowers are saddled with false placement of force-placed insurance.	non-experiential
escrow accounts have entirely too many unexplained fees.	unverifiable
loan servicers should be forced to explain every fee on an escrow account on a monthly basis so borrowers are made aware of what they are being charged and why.	unverifiable
also the loan servicer should not be allowed to create an escrow account for borrowers with a non-escrow loan without explaining why.	unverifiable
the tax balance and insurance balance should be kept separate to prevent the borrower from being pushed into foreclosure for nonpayment of taxes due to the loan servicer's erroneous placement of force-placed insurance.	unverifiable
i've registered as a consumer	experiential
but to be clear i'm an attorney who has done real estate closings	experiential
though it was never a practice area.	unverifiable
further, my comments that follow are admittedly not directly on point for this section but of the section choices this seemed the closest to my concern.	unverifiable
two weeks ago i closed my own mortgage refinancing simply to get a much better interest rate.	experiential
the closing documents totaled 127 pages, exclusive of the title report and home appraisal.	experiential
the closing documents required approximately thirty signatures, and initials on almost every remaining page.	experiential
my closing took an hour and a half and i  understood what i was doing.	experiential
if i was representing someone, particularly the buyer, who wanted each document explained, the closing process would have been much longer.	unverifiable
this is information overload and unnecessarily, in my opinion, complicates the process and dilutes comprehension.	unverifiable
now, in my case, i recognized that not all these documents were required by regulation for consumer protection.	non-experiential
nevertheless, a simple home mortgage refinancing should not require 127 pages to protect all parties with an interest in the transaction.	unverifiable
in giving the banks 5-45 business days to respond to information requests, i am left to assume that the cfpb has been watching too much mad men and is attempting to regulate a bank in 1960.	unverifiable
if i were to use my debit card to make a 2purchase anywhere in the world, it will show pending on my account instantly.	unverifiable
that check will clear the instant it is scanned by anything attached to the internet.	unverifiable
we are no longer living in the checking times described by tom hanks' character in catch me if you can.	unverifiable
there's not a 10 day delay in a check clearing because it has to be mailed through central depositories and to corporate offices, etc.	non-experiential
the banks who made this process instantaneous are the same ones servicing our mortgages .now.	non-experiential
no matter who you have an account with, whether it's a bank or credit union, large or small, it doesn't matter...	unverifiable
walk into a branch and ask for account information.	unverifiable
that representative will immediately pull your information up and tell you what you need to know.	non-experiential
if there's a discrepancy and you're arguing with them, they'll even turn their monitor around and show you what they're looking at right then and there.	non-experiential
if you ask for anything in writing, they will hand it to you.	non-experiential
if you ask for a screenprint, they will provide it.	non-experiential
the line at the bank today still moves faster than it did in your grandparent's day.	non-experiential
you mean to tell me it's an instantaneous process to deduct a check card transaction from the balance of my arizona-based account for a $10 purchase i made in china,	non-experiential
somebody please explain to me how that's considered acceptable in any way.	unverifiable
no matter what it is, you can figure out how everything in the world works, is made, etc...except in the financial and insurance industries.	unverifiable
1. this rule only works if there are requirements to notify on denials, with harsh penalties for failure to send notice of a denial timely, including loss of right of forclosure for a proscribed period	unverifiable
and that the clock would not start until person was sucessfully contacted via certified signature required mail.	unverifiable
2. servicer denies appeals as a rubber stamp of their own actions.	unverifiable
does nothing.	unverifiable
3. borrowers rejections must have ample time to evaluate the situation 48 hour decision windows, on real estate transactions like your primary residence should not be allowed.	unverifiable
4. this should also have an appeal window.	unverifiable
absolutely critical to construct this culture and structure of support for accurate and continual exchange of information with the main affected party: at-risk owner.	unverifiable
i would propose that the owner have access to the full checklist of documents that he or she must satisfy for the completion of the process in question, and see the same documents that the service can see.	unverifiable
hearing someone tell you over the phone that they can't find a document that you delivered over and over again is about the most frustrating and alienating and helpless shady experience i had while trying to short sale my home.	unverifiable
my continual and repeated efforts where futile and inefficient.	unverifiable
at the beginning of our struggle all we wanted was to convert our option arm loan to a 30 year fixed at a lower interest.	experiential
our calls were ignored for months and we were transferred to one person after another,	experiential
each time we had to begin again with our explanation and information!	experiential
when at last we had to get another loan to avoid the continuing financial slide, countrywide sends us e-mails telling us what a good customer we were and offering us a 30 year fixed rate.	experiential
this should not be allowed!	unverifiable
how...you've given a concrete stance w or  absolutely no statistics to back it up.	unverifiable
i've given well thought out and detailed arguments for why everything should be treated evenly.	unverifiable
right now your proposed rules for avoiding foreclosure presume every foreclosure is lawful, which is absurd.	unverifiable
unlike the national foreclosure fraud settlement, your proposals do not address wrongful foreclosures.	unverifiable
however, even though the national foreclosure fraud suit alleges deceptive practices in wrongful foreclosures,	non-experiential
the administration of the settlement will not stop them.	unverifiable
"your proposed rules for ""avoiding foreclosure"" need to add a provision to stop an unlawful foreclosure in progress"	unverifiable
and you need to enforce the national foreclosure fraud settlement	unverifiable
because the state attorneys general have no intention of doing so.	unverifiable
page 27 of the multistate complaint, which is posted on nationalmortgagesettlement.com brought by the state attorneys general, the doj and other regulators specifically names the deceptive practices used by banks to take homes they have no right to foreclose on,	non-experiential
and, by identifying these violations as deceptive practices, acknowledge these acts are under the purview of state attorneys general and the cfpb.	unverifiable
the state attorneys general having brought suit over wrongful conduct related to foreclosures, but now will not investigate it or stop it, so it is up to the cfpb.	unverifiable
* none of the state attorneys general offices or the cfpb will investigate and stop in progress the deceptive practices described beginning on page 27 of the lawsuit.	unverifiable
* none of the state attorneys general offices or the cfpb have a consumer complaint form on their website which seeks information about violations of the deceptive practices described beginning on page 27 of the lawsuit.	non-experiential
* none of the state attorneys general offices or the cfpb will acknowledge over the phone they have the authority to investigate and stop in progress the deceptive practices described beginning on page 27 of the lawsuit.	unverifiable
stop wrongful foreclosures based on deceptive practices in progress.justice will not happen on its own.	unverifiable
we could use some help.	unverifiable
since the new servicer is essentially the 'buyer' of the right to service the mortgage why does this proposed rule not require full disclosure of all information provided by the prior servicer within a reasonable period of time.	unverifiable
it seems to me that by acquiring those servicing rights the servicer should also have responsibilities regarding completion and accuracy of information transfer from 'old' to 'new' servicers.	unverifiable
with full disclosure to the borrower of the information obtained from the previous servicer within 30 days.	unverifiable
this should enhance transparency by making this all available to the borrower in this process.	unverifiable
the effects of a bubble economy are simply to onerous.	unverifiable
the problem is that the real estate industry has resisted and whittled down all attempts to limit those mortgages containing a government guarantee.	unverifiable
the underlying economic value of a home in the economy by the top 30% wage earners should be used as a basis for cutting off government mortgage subsidies	non-experiential
part of this is the mortgage home deduction.	non-experiential
there should be a maximum value this deduction based on the maximum earning capacity of the 70th percentile.	unverifiable
this would be in many markets in the $200k to $300k size.	unverifiable
mortgages should not be guaranteed above this amount.	unverifiable
so if a $700k mortgage was originated only $300k would be tax deductible	unverifiable
and only $300k mortgage would be government guaranteed,	unverifiable
this would also apply to tax free income from sales of homes.	unverifiable
those homes that sell over $300k would not be eligible above $300k for the gains.	unverifiable
so if a home sold for $400k then the 100k would be taxable.	unverifiable
what i mean by the 70th percentile is traditional formulaes say 1 or 3 of income to service debt.	unverifiable
that means that when interest rates rise these values change also.	non-experiential
no i recognize these values are arbitrary so 70th percentile could be 80th,	unverifiable
and that increased interest rates could be averaged to minimize economic forces.	unverifiable
however overall we need to discourage bubbles through our taxation and guarantee policies.	unverifiable
that's easy, existing laws.	unverifiable
the financial industry already decided on which borrowers should receive a lmo for their own financial protection, the homeowners who if foreclosed on would cost the investor to lose a guaranteed portion of their initial investment proven by a andnpv.	unverifiable
any homeowner with a loan to value above 80%  would cost the investor to lose a significant portion of the capital investment, a postive net present value regardless of the homeowners personal financial status	non-experiential
since no other branch of the govermnent has enforced existing laws,	non-experiential
"it is up to the cfpb, which was in my proposal to the government in the fall of 2008, to get the ""fox out of the henhosue""."	unverifiable
it is in direct violation of the law when two homeowners with the same negative equity  do not receive the same consistent similar financial incentive to remain a negative equity homeowner	non-experiential
following is a partial list of the violations occurring : unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices,misrepresentation that modifications are about affordability when a andnpv is required, the reasonable reliance that main street has that the government and wall street would act in good faith and fair dealings or the fact that every time a homeowner is denied a negative equity modification for his or hers social economic status being put at a financial disadvantage discrimation occurs.	unverifiable
a partial list of business, tort and civil violations occurring on a daily basis	unverifiable
wall street will not change their ways as long as there are no penalties that are enforced	unverifiable
since most homeowners do not have the financial whereitall to sue and the banks have the governments blessing and taxpayers money to do whatever they want,	unverifiable
and most important until the taxpayer paid entities of the gse's and the fha are included into standard capitalistic lmo's, of a modification for every negative equity homeowner,	unverifiable
the solution has been given to all seven governmental agencies back in the fall of 2008.	non-experiential
the proof is in the pudding so to speak,	unverifiable
the occ, and the ag's have included partial numerous guidelines from my proposal, unitedinprosperity.org to stop the foreclosure crisis from continuing, such as single point of contact, dual tracking, staffing, time limits, communications, standards etcc..	non-experiential
but all without including the underlying principle that housing is a capitalist product not a socialistic one.	non-experiential
"the mortgage clause of ""dont pay be foreclosed on"" was changed to ""let me modify you if you have negative equity, not if you can't afford it"""	unverifiable
because of the governments actions and inactions and the lenght of time past,	unverifiable
it is crucial that the solution be enforced now not in another 6-9-12-15-18-21 months.	unverifiable
i would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with any member of government at their convenience.	unverifiable
a check list of disclosures and rights to legal disclosures should be required at every closing on the front page.	unverifiable
a borrower shouldn't have to hire a third party or search over the internet to discover what legal disclosures they are entitled to.	unverifiable
prior to my foreclosure, a third party  was hired to send out a qwr;	experiential
it consisted of six pages sent certified on 4-19-2009 requesting documents to which i never would have known i had any rights to.	experiential
the servicer replied on 08-10-2009 to the third party and never cc any copy over to me.	experiential
when the third party sent me a copy, the letter stated that the servicer responded enclosing the adjustable rate note and mortgage	experiential
but the remaining request were internal business records and did not need to be furnished under respa 12 usc section 2506 .	experiential
the third party in my opinion knew what to ask for.	experiential
why further place any more restrictions.	unverifiable
the servicer in the same response letter stated that they had nothing to do with the loans origination and that they were not affiliated with the original lender.	experiential
the servicer included a contact address and phone number to where the loan originator could be reached.	experiential
what i found out later at the security exchange commission website was the bankruptcy purchase agreement between the loan servicer and my bankrupt loan originator.	experiential
1. there is a great need for a third party service since consumers are limited on knowledge.	unverifiable
2. notice the four months it took for the servicer to respond.	experiential
3. i did not receive an account history until after foreclosure, and after filing a complaint with department of corporations.	experiential
4. i don't see how a servicer who purchases servicing rights, the building, and assets can inform a consumer to contact a defunct originator in which they know is no longer present.	experiential
i do not see any points in protecting servicers if their designed intent is to stall, collect, and use deceptive practices that further damage consumer rights.	unverifiable
i do not think the cfpb should be equating any such leniency for servicers.	unverifiable
the 4 letter original lender code followed by a dash then loan number needs to be on the closing documents.	unverifiable
it is important that this combo can not be altered for the life of the loan.	unverifiable
if i punch in on line for example bofa-123756327 then i should be able to pull up a chain of title linked to property records, leins, taxes etc.	non-experiential
we have had the technology for so long.	unverifiable
the worst problem is that people can't defend themselves in court with out a chain of title and banks are adding additional force placed insurance policies by altering the loan number on the policies so they are hard to trace.	unverifiable
make it simple,	unverifiable
we have the technology.	unverifiable
this way the banks will have to clean up their behavior	unverifiable
because they will not have a choice.	unverifiable
we purchased a home in ca in 2005 via country wide with an adjustable rate interest.	experiential
we also took out a 2nd with citi.	experiential
citi purchased our first from country wide.	experiential
we are currently 40% underwater.	experiential
we worked with naca and waited 5 months to be approved for a lower fixed interest rate on our 1st two years ago.	experiential
we fell behind on our 1st due to multiple health related issues .	experiential
we jumped through hoops with citi for 5-6 months, again, via naca regarding the 1st.	experiential
we stopped making payments in jan 2012 due to the lack of income during the injuries and in order to persuade them to work with us.	experiential
they resently sold our 1st to carrington, after telling us that we made too much money to qualify for any type of loan modifiation .	experiential
meanwhile, we put the majority of our house payment money in a savings account.	experiential
citi via naca refused to negotiate with us on our 2nd.	experiential
now carrington is telling us that we qualify for a fha 30 year fixed rate mortgage  6.50% and that they will pay off the 2nd	experiential
citi now is willing to take only $7,000 for a $95,000  7.75%.	experiential
we are both still employed,	experiential
but we are facing some possible lay offs due to sequestration in jan 2013 and will have a large increase in our health insurance, beginning oct. 1st, via the employer, along with furlough days.	experiential
more furlough days may be on the way after the november 2012 elections .	experiential
we are working with naca to see if we qualify for the hamp,	experiential
but they do not think we will qualify based upon our income, right now.	experiential
we physically have recovered, for the most part, from our injuries and have some current pending litigation which will take years to settle.	experiential
i am not in such a hurry to follow through with the refinancing until i hear about the decision regarding the hamp.	experiential
we now have credit scores of 630 and 650 instead of 730 and 720 .	experiential
a 6.50 interest rate sounds very high	unverifiable
and we are current with all of our creditors.	experiential
it does make sense to provide statements  to discharged borrowers who continue to pay the mortgage.	unverifiable
i agree that some may no longer want statements, perhaps because they are walking away.	unverifiable
but those who filed bankruptcy in order to save thier homes should be allowed to request and receive statements and online access to properly manage the accout.	unverifiable
the proposed rule requires that the mortgage servicer continue to pay the homeowner's insurance   from the escrow account even if the customer is in default on the loan.	non-experiential
this places an undue burden on the mortgage servicer.	unverifiable
it is often the case that forced placed insurance is much cheaper than the cost of a full blown ho ins policy, particularly with small balance loans where the servicer only needs to protect its interest in the property, not the full value of the loan.	non-experiential
if a customer is in default and has not made payment for many months , the home owner is being unduly enriched and the mortgage servicer is being harmed by having to payout much more than it otherwise would have to to protect its interest in the property.	unverifiable
the commentary suggests that the mortgage servicer pay the ho ins premium monthly to avoid having the customer cancel the policy and run off with the funds.	unverifiable
i strongly believe that this is an untenable situation for the loan servicer, which now has 12x the amount of work to do.	unverifiable
consumers need protections,	unverifiable
but enough is enough.	unverifiable
if a consumer stops paying their loan, the servicer should be free to place forced fire insurance.	unverifiable
the real question is the definition of default.	unverifiable
1 or 2 months behind is clearly not enough.	unverifiable
but if a consumer hasn't made a payment for 6 months, the servicer should be free to inform the cutsomer that it no longer will escrow for ho ins.	unverifiable
the consumer can then look for their own insurance.	unverifiable
if they get it, great.	unverifiable
if not, then the lender can place forced insurance.	unverifiable
once the lender stops escrowing for ho ins, it must rerun its escrow analysis to make sure a refund is not due back to the consumer.	unverifiable
however, let's be honest, with 6 months of missed payment, a refund will never be due.	unverifiable
i believe this is a very reasonable resolution to this issue.	unverifiable
the answer to this question needs to be guided by the long history of contract law in america.	unverifiable
if the customer makes his payment after the grace period has expired, then the customer is contractually obligated to pay the late charge.	non-experiential
so the answer is yes, the customer must pay the late charge before the monthly payment is to be considered fully paid.	unverifiable
the cfpb should not be issuing a rule which over-rides a legal contractual obligation of the borrower to the lender.	unverifiable
excluding the late charge is arbitrary and not based on any solid legal foundation.	unverifiable
excluding the principal portion is no more arbitrary than excluding the late charge.	unverifiable
please make rules which are based on the legal contractual obligation between the borrower and the lender, not based upon a feel good approach that views lenders and loan servicers as evil and borrowers as angels that are never in the wrong and  have no responsibilities to live up to.	unverifiable
my comment about email is a more a general one, that it should be a required form of communication due to the prolific use of email at this time.	unverifiable
not sure of the cost but i imagine that most correspondence is boiler plate.	unverifiable
sending an email is less expensive than postal mail.	non-experiential
i think our laws lag in this area due to the alleged strain it would put on customer service departments.	unverifiable
in my opinion most organizations have divested in this area and consumers experience huge gaps in this area.	unverifiable
"one of the pitfalls for us with ""too big to fail"" organizations."	unverifiable
i recently refied a mortgage through a small firm in charlotte, nc.	experiential
they informed me that my mortgage would be sold.	experiential
during the waiting period, i had to make payments to them and the payments were recorded correctly without any problem.	experiential
approximately 30 days ago, i received a letter from citi that they bought my mortgage.	experiential
the balance stated was wrong as i had made extra principle payments.	experiential
i then received a statement from them and the history of the account was totally blank other than one payment.	experiential
i was informed that it was my problem and i should have not made the payments to the charlotte company.	experiential
it is my understanding from the citi letter that any payment made before 9 or 1 or 12, the payment was to go to the charlotte company.	experiential
looking at my mortgage balance on the citi website, citi is showing a mortgage balance of close to $10,000. more than what is owed.	experiential
i have even faxed them the history from the charlotte company for them to check and review the problem.	experiential
nothing has been done.	experiential
no phone calls, no email, no acknowledgement by citi of the reported problem.	experiential
in today's world where banks can post transactions daily, provide ach transfers, allow high frequency trading, why is it so hard for someone at citi to pick up the phone and resolve this issue.	unverifiable
the system is broken and the link is that big banks can not perform simple functions.	unverifiable
"not one person is complaining because they have ""too much information""."	unverifiable
"if all activity in a borrowers loan account is disclosed to the homeowner monthly, their would be no ""unduly burdensome"" phone calls to the servicer."	unverifiable
why is the cfpb complicating things further by separating what information only an attorney can get as opposed to what a borrower can get.	unverifiable
splitting the disclosure up between different companies without a simple monthly transparent statement is ignoring the real problem.	unverifiable
keep in mind this is not a regular bank statement with lots of entries.	unverifiable
this a 1 simple loan statement	unverifiable
"and there should only be a few entries under ""transaction activity"" each month with transparency."	unverifiable
"for example, if jp morgan gives assurant money for a force placed insurance policy and assurant cuts a check back to jp morgan or a subsidiary of jp morgan for 75% of the policy and both activities are related to my loan then the servicer needs to record both under ""transaction activity""."	unverifiable
if the servicer charges for a drive by inspections after your house sold then the company name and phone number need to be in transaction activity showing the payout.	unverifiable
"if your servicer and the closing agent both collect your current years property taxes at closing, the day it was paid out should show up in your ""transaction activity"" so you can find it."	unverifiable
if the bank is going to keep your account open for 6 months, after your closing, charging you additional interest, to use up some of the over stated closing money, then the bank should send you monthly statements, for 6 months, showing what they are doing behind your back.	unverifiable
limited disclosure like you are proposing is bad but you should see what happens, after the closing, when no disclosure statement is mailed out and your account is left open.	unverifiable
you don't know the half of it.	unverifiable
because this entry was not required, on the monthly statement, is the reason so many people, have been so badly abused and why this went unnoticed for so long.	unverifiable
"you say the banks claim it is ""unduly burdensome"" to tell me what they are doing to me."	unverifiable
let's dissect the banks objections and make some real progress.	unverifiable
transaction activity transparency is the category where the problems and solutions rest	unverifiable
"and it is being swept under the rug, with your plan, with very little disclosure and you are not hearing the ""ordinary"" people."	unverifiable
"moderator, please get a list from the cfpb of all the ""unduly burdensome"" issues the bank claims is beyond the roll of ""servicing"" a loan, that they are afraid to disclose."	unverifiable
unless someone is being over paid or generating some third party fraud that requires information to be hid, the banks should be happy to put everything on the monthly statement, to relieve the servicer, of the burden of all the phone calls.	unverifiable
the truth is the banksters know, that they have to put up with, unduly burdensome phone calls	unverifiable
and people will no longer need to call.	unverifiable
with full disclosure, the banks and the cfpb's phone should hardly ring, in reference to mortgage loans.	unverifiable
if you leave this category, the way it is now, you have just enabled the circus to continue.	unverifiable
it is up to the government to set the standards high not low, with transparency.	unverifiable
"why will obama not tell richard cordray to demand full disclosure, from the banks, for the ""ordinary"" people, if a bank wants to be able to continue to lend money,"	unverifiable
end of story!	unverifiable
which would allow servicers not to respond to certain types of information requests according to you.	unverifiable
"i get real nervous, when you talk about a ""new disclosure system by attorneys, rather than ordinary people""."	unverifiable
what is even more scary is your solution for the question that we are currently discussing that addresses not being able to get information from your lender.	unverifiable
"your solution talks about the cfpb's worry about ""the risk of overloading consumers with too much information""."	non-experiential
i have been alive for 50 years and nobody in any conversation has ever complained that their lender has given them too much information.	experiential
i realize that adam levitin, that just joined the cfpb, as an advisor, is an attorney and could benefit from this rule	unverifiable
but after reading some of his amazing papers i would love to know what he has to say about this.	unverifiable
the ordinary people should not have to pay out any money to get information on your loan	unverifiable
it should be provided monthly.	unverifiable
look at the earnings of the largest servicers even with all the lawsuits	non-experiential
and the banks probably cannot even believe they are getting away with providing such little detail.	unverifiable
borrower problem: borrowers not given information	unverifiable
solution: borrowers get all relevant information monthly, timely.	unverifiable
servicer problem: unduly burdensome phone calls where answers are few	unverifiable
solution: borrower gets all relevant information monthly eliminating unduly burdensome phone calls	unverifiable
warning a borrower about force placed insurance is irrelevant to addressing the problem, symptom or solution.	unverifiable
"after reading your link to 2024.37 force placed insurance 2viii i realized that the only solution that is being offered for all the force placed insurance issues is that the banks have to tell the borrower that they are about to place a force placed hazard insurance policy on them that ""cost significantly more""."	unverifiable
in other words, if you can't make your property insurance payment, our solution is to increase the price of the insurance.	unverifiable
providing a borrower a written statement that you are going to take advantage of them is not the solution but part of the problem.	unverifiable
trust me, after watching 4 years of abuse, the homeowners know they are about to be screwed over,	unverifiable
providing it in writing, mandated by the cfpb  just means that the government approves of this behavior,	unverifiable
which makes the pain even worse.	unverifiable
this is deplorable!	unverifiable
that is like saying, if you don't send in your $100.00 electric bill payment on time, we are going to charge you $500.00 per month for electric instead	unverifiable
"and we are going to add a creepy middle man, to share in our electricity scam that ""cost significantly more""."	unverifiable
the government wants to increase transparency, so i have to give you heads up to the scam in writing.	unverifiable
problem:homeowner has run into a financial issue and can't make their property insurance payment.	unverifiable
my 2nd provided solution: get the insurance payment as low as possible by eliminating all optional coverage	unverifiable
and only insure the structure for the bank at the lowest price possible.	unverifiable
allow the bank to place this on auto pay monthly and charge the homeowner interest on this amount just like their home loan.	unverifiable
if home is 3.5% interest then 3.5% on the insurance balance paid out monthly on auto pay.	non-experiential
if the combined balance at the bank between principle, interest and property insurance ever equals 3 months behind then foreclosure is an option.	unverifiable
if the bank cannot continue the same policy then they have to find one at the same price or lower.	unverifiable
remember this policy has a lot less things it covers because the homeowner side is removed	unverifiable
"so it actuality  is still considered ""significantly more"" at the same price because it covers less categories now and nobody has addressed this."	unverifiable
if you kick people when they are down instead of helping them up or just not kicking them and see if they can get up on their own is a better option.	unverifiable
just got a copy of it a couple of months ago.	experiential
multiple policies at the same time that include successors and assigns as obligated parties to the policies.	unverifiable
as shocking as this was, it is even more shocking that  the cfpb just wants banks to notify borrowers that they are about to be kicked them while they are down as a solution.	non-experiential
and they don't need a warning because they know what's coming	unverifiable
and this is irrelevant to any solution.	unverifiable
and so the size may not be the deciding factor on quality of servicing.	unverifiable
"but since there is not fiduciary duty between the borrower and the servicer, the quality of service to the borrower is simply ""voluntary"" at best."	non-experiential
the servicers have a duty to the investor, and do not work for the borrower.	unverifiable
so really there should be no exemtions at all, unless a fiduciary duty is imposed there will always be bad behavior and trickey to the detriment of the borrower.	unverifiable
small servicers may  have a better relationship with the borrowers, but it is not by obligation.	unverifiable
exceptions are simply loop holes for the opportunity to take advantage of the unsuspecting or uneducated...	unverifiable
this is absolutly out in left field.	unverifiable
in short, equality is vital...big or small...mom and pop vs chains...	unverifiable
the rules need to be the same.	unverifiable
the minute you feel your company is overwhelmed, create a job	unverifiable
there are plenty of people that need jobs...	unverifiable
it would be a great time and opportunity to grow your business and take your business to the next level...	unverifiable
get out of your comfort zone.	unverifiable
"you might sit and say, ""this is alot for little old me with only 1000 files"","	unverifiable
"but rest assured that the company with hundreds of thousands of files is saying, ""holy cow, this is going to cost me millions""..."	unverifiable
you are just at a different level.	unverifiable
equally the same for everyone, big or small.	unverifiable
it is amazing that this is even a topic or option,	unverifiable
of course it should be, or should have been in place.	unverifiable
where i get lost with this as the mortgagee.	unverifiable
as a mortgagee...mortgagee:	unverifiable
i really do not care about your house, i want my money.	unverifiable
your home is yours, your families nest.	unverifiable
as the mortgagee that extended you the money to purchase your families home, i simply want to make any or all arrangements possible to collect the money you agreed to for the home you decided was best for you and your family.	unverifiable
unfortunatley the money is tied to your home.	unverifiable
the bank does not want your house...	unverifiable
i promise they dont,	unverifiable
they want money.	unverifiable
not having a dept or case mgr within a company that will help the company aquire the original reason behind the transaction, is just flagrant.	unverifiable
in a case of asset-based lending, i could see the bank giving the run around,	unverifiable
he will make more profit reselling the property...which surely this is the basis behind hoepa, now prohibiting asset-based lending practices...	unverifiable
but does not make sense to properties that are upside down and a borrower trying to make good.	unverifiable
"for sure, ""continuity of contact"" ...one guy or gal, one number that can play the role of intermediary reducing the ""lost in translation"" effect between borrower and company..."	unverifiable
that would only or should apply if they are buying it...	unverifiable
what is happening is that service companies do just that...	unverifiable
again, as long as the borrower pays...everything is smooth.	unverifiable
it is not until the borrower doesnt pay is when we see inconsistencies with these loans and how the data is handled.	unverifiable
problem: every place where there is not transparency in lending there is fraud.	unverifiable
solution: all account activity directly and indirectly in your account has to be on the monthly statement addressing companies by name not category.	unverifiable
"problem: ""depending on circumstances"""	unverifiable
solution: no, all circumstances	unverifiable
