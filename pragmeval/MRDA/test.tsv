i i i think that uh the possibility uh can be that uh	Offer
if you add a good very good v.a.d. that works as well as a v.a.d. working on clean speech.	Statement
uh so in in fact it was pretty related to what liz and andreas did uh except that this was not with meeting stuff it was with	Floor Holder

and some preliminary observations.	Statement
but i'm not sure if that's of general interest or not.	Floor Holder
is he on the mailing list?	Rising Tone
um and then secondly we had you may remember um the problem with the re phrasing.	Floor Grabber
not a big deal.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh yeah the next thing is i started to play	Floor Holder
i think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals we need to change the interface so that they can do that.	Offer

you could do it about you.	Offer
in my brief uh encounter with it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is the only reason okay so i guess if we have a another bayes net to deal with this stuff the only reason we can design it is because we know what each question is asking?	Understanding Check
pitch.	Collaborative Completion
um but it's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly mismatched.	Floor Holder
i mean you're right.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these.	Offer
it's just saying as a baseline we know	Defending/Explanation
but if suppose you use the real boundaries that that you were in fact were given by the v a d and so forth.	Statement
but it was just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah he he didn't say he hasn't said anything to me about it.	Acknowledge-answer
and then it's coupled with the problem that sometimes you know with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off.	Rising Tone
no i won't ask the next question then.	Commit
i i have.	Accept
and to make it really clear that they knew it.	Defending/Explanation
uh i mean calendar year two thousand one.	Statement
yeah i i believe all that.	Floor Grabber

but when you abbreviate yourself as the basman you don't use any h s.	Statement
no they can only display one.	Reject
and they just filled it in.	Statement
counter balance.	Collaborative Completion
that subject always rephrase sort of the task that uh we gave them.	Rising Tone
rather than just them just going in and correcting it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she would be interested enough and have her read	Offer
this one thing.	Statement
but what you do want to do is take the even if it's klugey take the segments the synchronous segments the ones from the h l t paper where only that speaker was talking.	Statement
or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask?	Or-Clause
is there a bakery around here?	Yes-No-question
and you know you could fire up a transcriber interface for you know in different windows multiple ones one for each channel.	Offer
stop breathing.	Action-directive
no well that's a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
and by the late eighties there were uh we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets.	Statement
if there are things that you know are intention specific then we should put them up somewhere.	Offer
but i like i like what liz is saying about	Assessment/Appreciation
i just don't think a winner take all type of thing is the	Dispreferred Answers

thank you very much.	Thanking
like the transcription.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i don't know yet the what happened tuesday.	Other Answers
but anyway i i'd it'd be neat to have that.	Floor Grabber
in the in the measurement uh the average uh dividing by the by the um variance.	Rising Tone
but so anyway i think that looks pretty good.	Floor Grabber
what does it put out?	Wh-Question
i think andreas was leading to this topic.	Downplayer
kind of inspired by the stuff by larry saul with the uh uh learning articulatory feature in i think in the case of his paper with sonorance based on uh multi band information where you have a a combination of gradient learning and uh e m.	Expansions of y/n Answers
whatever other frames you have involved they have to match up in in nice ways.	Statement

there is some some very silly bug somewhere.	Defending/Explanation

yeah very low.	Accept
or or well matched case.	Misspeak Self-Correction
uh and it's used for a lot of different types of data.	Statement
i guess that makes sense.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but it completely got rid of the speech.	Statement
uh in the final thing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah so i think for the stuff liz was talking about we have something that'll work now.	Floor Grabber
what if you used a smaller window for the delta?	Wh-Question
yeah yeah yeah yep.	Accept
some speech over it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and and that bothered some other people.	Statement
oh so you uh so you really set it to zero the f.f.t.	Understanding Check
i don't remember getting anything.	Other Answers
because we'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime.	Defending/Explanation
oh i guess it	Acknowledge-answer
where you did something differently for each um uh i don't know whether it was each mel band or each uh um f f t bin or	Expansions of y/n Answers
which we are.	Statement
and you don't do anything else.	Expansions of y/n Answers

even if they were listening to it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
half open?	Declarative-Question
i don't know exactly to think what we can improve.	Rising Tone
but the um noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak.	Statement
uh yeah wait	Acknowledge-answer
so that we can you know show a clear path.	Defending/Explanation
and all the names could should be taken cum grano salis.	Offer

but i i don't if i would i would need to have have that.	Reject-part
forceful.	Offer
that's that's going to be better.	Assessment/Appreciation
this is what what do you uh what's in the paper there?	Rising Tone
is she?	Understanding Check
and so and it does correspond to a realistic situation in the sense that um people might really be trying to uh call out telephone numbers or or something like that in in their cars.	Floor Holder
and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise.	Statement
it's uh ranging from zero to clean.	Rising Tone
i don't know if it's the first one.	Other Answers
you mean they have some.	Correct-misspeaking
i think he's right.	Accept
if we have something like this here.	Rising Tone
the department has many mayors.	Humorous Material
but that it should be down for an hour.	Downplayer
versus if they heard a slightly different one.	Expansions of y/n Answers
though maybe not.	Expansions of y/n Answers
how did you get your voiced and unvoiced truth data?	Wh-Question
okay that's interesting okay.	Acknowledge-answer
and and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame?	Understanding Check
maybe they should have said focus or something.	Offer
or or or or will it just	Understanding Check
and they put the number in when they hear it.	Offer
for the tandem net you mean?	Understanding Check
but it would be really interesting to see if they're good enough.	Offer
for each	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean without noise compensation certainly c zero is better than log energy.	Statement
say that last part again.	Action-directive
i've noticed that yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it's very exciting.	Assessment/Appreciation
or uh i extracted it incorrectly.	Statement
it sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is going to be.	Statement
uh no that's quite possible.	Floor Holder
but the solution to that is just set the option so it doesn't compute the shape file and it will work.	Offer
uh so if you trained on half as much and made the net uh uh half as big then it would be one fourth the amount of time.	Statement
so um i'm still tinkering with it.	Floor Holder
the nice thing about c v s is is you can be on a different machine.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh i i think that's nicer for a lot of reasons.	Assessment/Appreciation
and um then it would it would uh be something to to discuss in the meeting.	Floor Holder
but weren't you cheating in those experiments?	Rising Tone
um yeah we we should just have you have you read it but i uh we've all got these little proceedings.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
uh actually yeah.	Accept
i didn't look uh more closely.	Defending/Explanation
pretty straightforward.	Assessment/Appreciation
you're shifting the feature space.	Statement
um um the i i'm really very i'm extremely fortunate with the people who uh applied and who are transcribing for us.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
damn this project!	Exclamation
and yeah like multiple multiple video cameras covering every everybody every place in the room.	Statement
yeah just a two three two four that would be	Accept

it's pejorative to ourselves.	Statement
zero percent error?	Declarative-Question
i mean i don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i'm yeah i'm i'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely.	Downplayer
yeah it's there.	Accept
um and um the other thing uh	Floor Holder
so there's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions.	Floor Holder
yep it's sort of one of those that's it's more like a decision tree if if you want.	Floor Grabber
is that your point?	Rising Tone
so uh oh though thilo isn't here.	Floor Holder
well so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words.	Understanding Check
yeah it's machine machine experiments.	Floor Grabber
yeah there certainly is that yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and so this would be a useful thing um to know in terms of like which which um which of these categories are are good for um speech recognition.	Defending/Explanation
but they will um	Statement
and that doesn't work.	Statement
run like this.	Offer
well i think it's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same.	Statement
when you this uh	Statement
so for example um if i know where voicing occurs and everything um i would do a phone um phone recognition experiment.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so what if you then uh since you know this what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions?	Offer
yes again.	Acknowledge-answer
but you could	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah the l.d.a.l.d.a. we don't know is like is it very crucial for the features right?	Understanding Check
i'm just glad that i don't have to work it out.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean when we did our first experiments and i was uh creating s r i feature files from the icsi front end i just had perl scripts you know and hacked a bunch of stuff together.	Statement
you have ninety features?	Declarative-Question
depends.	Maybe
and so i think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them.	Statement
no we originally we did that.	Reject
the which one?	Rising Tone
there's a threshold.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and well it's a little bit better but not	Statement
so as i uh but it's not perfect.	Downplayer
so so i guess that's sort of a last	Floor Holder
this picture?	Declarative-Question
uh i mean go backwards from what the nonlinearity would you know would be.	Offer
that's just aligned to the beginning of someone else's speech uh in that segment.	Statement
so was i not in the loop on that?	Rising Tone
yeah and all that sort of stuff.	Accept
yeah just subtract that	Floor Grabber
yeah there's uh the the standard deviation of the signal gives you a good clue.	Floor Grabber
yes uh	Floor Grabber
and it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth.	Defending/Explanation
what are when are we are we going to do that?	Rising Tone
within the segment.	Collaborative Completion
and if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough um then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well.	Offer
uh first order for speech recognition you say i don't care about the source.	Statement
how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries?	Wh-Question
so i'm like rad.	Humorous Material
or or twelve.	Offer
yeah because you can get a number uh for that with the other as well.	Accept
so you should weight those other conditions very you know really small.	Understanding Check
so when you were saying we need to do a re run of like	Understanding Check
that mean that the v t s huh with the v t s we obtain	Defending/Explanation
yeah that's a good like error checking approach i think.	Accept
yes i understand now.	Acknowledge-answer
well thanks for the filter.	Thanking
do you remember who the groups were that we're doing?	Rising Tone
and i wanted to maybe take a picture of that.	Statement
well uh it's it sort of came into my mind that sometimes even two could be on and would be interesting.	Offer
two words.	Collaborative Completion
but that's a separate training.	Negative Non-no Answers
which is a five processor machine.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean we we could do different interfaces.	Offer
okay so why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically.	Floor Grabber
and it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy.	Statement
just like really basic stuff.	Downplayer
because what i was suggesting in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole thing you'd have to have the the tonal differences between the two kind of small.	Defending/Explanation
two hundred million dollars.	Humorous Material
but you're saying for this for the adaptation you mean.	Understanding Check
i find it really convenient the way the way it's set up right now.	Statement
it's the spectral envelope.	Expansions of y/n Answers

if they were going sequentially through it why wouldn't we give them	Wh-Question

you could have um each speaker in the meeting say beep and record it.	Offer

it still has the median filter.	Assessment/Appreciation

the forced alignment might not work then.	Rising Tone
i i have received some suggestions for change which i've made.	Statement
because it doesn't have it have less of of france telecom stuff.	Defending/Explanation

well i mean there's this cyber transcriber service.	Understanding Check
that's better than running into problems.	Statement

because what you're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced.	Defending/Explanation
they can do experiments.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
here obviously it's not.	Statement
but and and some of what you i mean you also appear quite a bit in that cross talk.	Floor Holder
then you'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word.	Statement
for for all the channels.	Understanding Check

theoretically the construction parser would do that.	Misspeak Self-Correction

well you have distance and you have	Negative Non-no Answers
and is are are are any deltas being computed of of them?	Understanding Check
right so you can	Accept
yeah it just seems like you know if it were bootstrapping or if it were i mean there are other ways to maybe get the point across.	Floor Grabber
so that's it i think for the on line normalization.	Rising Tone
it's just uh that it	Statement
and and then when the the the proposals actually came in and half of them had v a d's and half of them didn't.	Statement
okay go on to uh whatever.	Floor Grabber
this is this.	Rising Tone
which is in a way uh something like the smoothing the wiener filter.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then do then alternate in more depth.	Offer
which is direct.	Statement
so basically the idea is to to feed the output of that belief net into another belief net.	Understanding Check
um given that we're going to have for this test at least of uh boundaries what if initially we start off by using known sections of nonspeech for the estimation?	Offer
and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit.	Offer
what if you were to preload all the channels or or initially?	Offer
and we should have like we should have decoder meetings and stuff.	Offer
finals was that.	Statement
using the close talking i think would be much better.	Assessment/Appreciation
really that's sort of a cartoon picture about what's voiced and unvoiced.	Defending/Explanation
you did?	Understanding Check
either you let people do it themselves or you don't.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we've got great headphones	Statement
the i don't know myself joke.	Rising Tone
and i think like when mari and katrin and jeff are here it'd be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts.	Offer
i have several in my head.	Statement
anyways so i i guess	Floor Grabber
self	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

depends on t.	Statement
however it is uh you know sort of these sort of things are imaginable.	Defending/Explanation
scenario based.	Collaborative Completion
pretty simple.	Repeat
just so that they're continuing to get the distant uh information.	Defending/Explanation
she said she has something.	Rising Tone
so do you get a score for each alignment?	Rising Tone
i think that you'd end up with a better system overall.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i mean you know we we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without without worrying about it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and i think wouldn't it be better to to have a little longer sequences for the recognizer?	Rising Tone
why don't you go ahead and start?	Offer
well the only the only question about that that i have is um i think brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape.	Statement
i mean it seems like	Statement
so basically that will store the the object that is	Statement
so this is supposed to be under that little protuberance.	Understanding Check
and i can calculate this.	Rising Tone
which is because that's what we've been using so far.	Defending/Explanation
in other words everybody can check out anything.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but but if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it just letting them log in to icsi might be okay.	Offer
which is the italian mismatch.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so just truly chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting.	Understanding Check
but it's running under windows.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no it's certainly not this.	Reject
might be beyond what you want to do.	Statement
and so you know i've i've sat here and watched sometimes the breathing.	Statement
but then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly.	Negative Non-no Answers
i want to see die dukes von hazard.	Humorous Material
having the baseline be the m f c c's means that people could choose to pour their their effort into trying to do a really good v a d.	Statement
so when we get closer we'll find people's plane schedules and let everybody know.	Rising Tone
well i have i will.	Commit
there is ten that comes from the l.d.a. filters also.	Rising Tone
but uh um i decided not to do that after all.	Floor Holder
the fact that is has so much technological jargon in it it makes it considerably harder to um to transcribe and to to double check and all those things.	Defending/Explanation
sort of a text template.	Statement
well it's different for different tasks.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students.	Accept
you won't it'll be hard to decide.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i see yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
i mean you have twenty for delta computation.	Understanding Check
i mean we could check.	Defending/Explanation
and if you saw that then maybe you it would something would occur to you of how to deal with that.	Statement
so are we going get an external service or are we going to do it?	Rising Tone
when is the development set i mean the uh uh test set results due?	Wh-Question
yeah it's the same training set.	Accept
not eva?	Declarative-Question
it's a speech act.	Statement
but on the other hand if everybody is trying different kinds of noise suppression things and so forth it might be good to standardize on the piece that we're not changing.	Offer
oh i meant this.	Floor Grabber
i mean my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk.	Offer
basically things you ignore get marginalized over.	Statement
um i do several experiment with the spanish database first.	Floor Holder
this like that ..	Expansions of y/n Answers
some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on	Statement
i'm not sure if anyone's still using it.	Other Answers
so there is a a first feature stream that use uh straight m.f.c.c. features.	Rising Tone
he's on the standing on the bus waving to me.	Statement
so maybe we should just say it.	Offer
eurospeech is due on friday.	Statement
that was at least forty five minutes.	Understanding Check
yeah so we have this new speaker adaptation.	Floor Grabber
liz you want to talk about recognition?	Humorous Material
i had suggested it before.	Statement
i thought somebody had.	Statement
if it's individual um we can probably run a forced alignment.	Statement
an example would be nice.	Offer
and which is a a a simpler problem perhaps but which is perhaps important for noisy speech.	Floor Holder
everyone's adjusting their microphones of course.	Humorous Material
but uh just let me say with reference to this idea of um higher order organization within meetings.	Statement
one more remark uh concerning the s r i recognizer.	About-task
we're talking about we're talking about that demo.	3rd-party-talk
no you can	Reject
yeah i can worry about the ontology interface.	Commit
so i don't think that's a good solution.	Assessment/Appreciation
so hynek will try to push for trying to combine uh different things?	Understanding Check
yes it'll be pretty horrible.	Accept
i i could set someone on that tomorrow.	Commit
because we've been arguing about it all week.	Statement
like if we want to study um speaker habits but we can't do speaker detection.	Statement
there must be.	Statement
yeah they're all gender dependent.	Accept
make a time suggestion.	Commit
oh you meant pastries then?	Acknowledge-answer
so do we have a meeting that that's been done with?	Rising Tone
i mean it's not artificially added noise or anything.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it would be much easier.	Assessment/Appreciation
so so if the endpoint if the go there is yes and no then go there discourse will just be fifty fifty.	Statement
and and they um they run l.d.a. on the features right before they train the models.	Statement
okay um why don't we get started on that subject anyways?	Floor Grabber
and uh in rectangular kind of coordinates.	Floor Holder
no that's how i've been looking at it.	Accept
is that what the keith node is?	Rising Tone
though yeah.	Statement
no the idea was i guess to to use them as as features.	Defending/Explanation
and it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the	Understanding Check
so we have this good system with good v a d.	Rising Tone
so i did two experiments.	Statement
and we get a certain we have a situation vector and a user vector and everything is fine.	Rising Tone
there were i think fifty five segments um in in x waves and and sort of did a crude check.	Statement
do you know who was who was since we weren't in on it uh do you know who was in from o g i?	Rising Tone
and say okay	Statement
that's done.	Accept-part
and if the performance goes down in the t.i. digits mismatch high mismatch like this	Statement
i actually really like them though.	Assessment/Appreciation
let's uh yeah they're	Statement
we can go ahead and talk about that a little bit.	Offer
yeah you can search for beep or bleep.	Floor Grabber
yeah i think that's what it is.	Accept
because you because you up here you have the a plus b.	Defending/Explanation
and so once i get that done then i'll generate the p files i need.	Statement
yeah that's an interesting thing to try to see if what's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition it's um causing deletions by having this silence probability up up too high.	Acknowledge-answer
um well i should have we should have added an an x m l example.	Floor Grabber
and you could have also indicated that by saying enter what are the kinds of action i am.	Understanding Check
there was something you were going to uh some parameter you were going to vary depending on the frequency.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz let's say?	Wh-Question
so what what about um what	Wh-Question
okay it's off so you can put it on.	3rd-party-talk
this is these are things we will find out.	Sympathy

key	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah like do do uh one for each one for each person in the meeting you can only hire people who have perfect pitch.	Floor Holder
i think i just tried it on speechdat-car.	Defending/Explanation
so then you're going to feed the those into some standard recognizer?	Understanding Check
well we had we had talked about doing maybe e d u as a good choice though.	Negative Non-no Answers
yet	Floor Grabber
in my view.	Statement
it's already pretty slow to load.	Assessment/Appreciation
what you you	Wh-Question

and that's what i just thought he was doing.	Statement
inexpensive.	Correct-misspeaking
as for to decide the response.	Defending/Explanation
this is one it's one hour of of of speech?	Understanding Check
um and then just seeing if that is enough to to handle the transcript changes.	Offer
so i was adding a white noise energy.	Rising Tone
because they have a related source path goal schema in our tourist domain.	Defending/Explanation
and the one we came up with is friday two thirty.	Understanding Check

that's ten words?	Understanding Check

you're subtracting in in in power domain or log domain?	Or-Question
one is when sometimes someone will start laughing when they're in the middle of a sentence.	Rising Tone
and then they went to	Rising Tone
yeah but it's a good thing anyway to have shorter delay.	Acknowledge-answer

which would mean then then mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like well more than sixty percent improvement on	Statement
i can't see you now.	Dispreferred Answers
is there any word yet about the issues about um adjustments for different feature sets or anything?	Rising Tone
so they went up being microsoft they went up to a billion.	Statement
so you have these twenty four features.	Floor Holder
so nobody would be there probably right?	Understanding Check
for these meetings?	Understanding Check
when when you do these same improvements to proposal one	Understanding Check
yeah he	Floor Grabber
unfortunately there's coupling between them.	Reject-part
then what have we done so far?	Rising Tone
that's just the the language model.	Expansions of y/n Answers
wouldn't that be?	Tag-Question
but the the wavefile part looks looks good.	Assessment/Appreciation
well trouble isn't a container.	Statement
add him.	Action-directive
now you could set up multiple windows each one with a different signal showing and then look between the windows.	Offer
because sometimes people will say and then i and there's a long pause.	Defending/Explanation
i mean you know i don't know	Other Answers
so they are	3rd-party-talk
as well as mappings?	Understanding Check

and between now and then yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and as the noise you add is the same is the shape it's also the same.	Statement
it's one mixture of the model right?	Understanding Check
they just switched position.	Defending/Explanation
right you can also	Floor Grabber
you you clip that part over your ear.	Statement
yeah but is is if	Floor Grabber
so x schemas then i would like to do	Statement
we have all that data.	Defending/Explanation
well they don't speak such clear english.	Rising Tone
because we wouldn't have the correct node.	Defending/Explanation
there's there's four and there's seven.	Understanding Check
and uh you could have one of them but and and see you know which of them helps.	Floor Holder
like on a highway.	Expansions of y/n Answers
this is just sort of an overall.	Statement
but i guess what's confusing me is if we have a bayes net to deal another bayes net to deal with this stuff.	Rising Tone
in other news.	Floor Grabber
and um hopefully it is by by means of keith that we will be able to get a a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is.	Floor Holder
and we can uh put this inside.	Rising Tone
might be.	Maybe
i'm uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
with a weight or whatever.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what is uh	Wh-Question
and then then there was some some modification of the cepstral parameters where they	Expansions of y/n Answers

for today.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the list of majors in the department?	Understanding Check
so we still have to do that.	About-task
okay so the way you're imaging is they kind of play it.	Acknowledge-answer
so so um	Floor Holder
and and i was just thinking that um if it were possible to bring that in like you know this week	Offer
if you think about a wavefile sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen.	Assessment/Appreciation
i'm not sure whether you want to do the demo live anyway.	Other Answers
they might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing.	Statement
so whatever.	Statement
so you always send up here i am i am this person and i can have these parents.	Statement
so you could argue in fact that the well matched is something you shouldn't be looking at at all.	Statement
so that'd be good from for analysis.	Humorous Material
you know it's it's um	Statement
you're just using the full ninety features?	Declarative-Question
and then also should we go ahead and get another wireless system?	Yes-No-question
but um basically it was about um uh going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using using data from something else and adapting and how well that works.	Floor Holder
too too high?	Expansions of y/n Answers
to try to to do uh uh a fast a fast uh experiment to to prove that nnn this uh general feature uh can solve the the the problem.	Statement
well no i mean it's uh four gigabytes for forty minutes.	Reject
and to or just to use a neural network.	Rising Tone
yeah maybe we can include that also in our second uh data run.	Floor Grabber
well we can start gathering those those ideas.	Offer
yeah if you have two and they're at the edges it's like here and here.	Accept

you just want to know where it is.	Statement
yeah let's let's see where we are at three thirty.	Action-directive
how about i'm in a hurry?	Open-Question
i actually think that thilo's in a in a a you know when you do the pre segmenter and you and you run across troubles he he runs across some of these that are	Statement

not really and.	Statement
so there's the the l.d.a. is is right there before the h.m.m.'s.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because we'd have to completely redo those meetings and we have like ten of them now.	Defending/Explanation
uh actually i have to to go.	Floor Grabber
when you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only and didn't have this side path um uh with the the pure features as well did it make things better to have the neural net?	Rising Tone
and the l.d.a. that we are applying is only in time.	Statement
but it's not pejorative towards the data.	Dispreferred Answers

so they're they're looking at a mixed signal?	Floor Holder
no no the question is do you want to do you want to construe do you want to constr strue	Reject
is two hundred the	Yes-No-question
think also that um we can have one or as many as we want links from from the schema up to the action um description of it.	Rising Tone
if it gets an unambiguous result then you're definitely in a in a in a in a uh region with speech.	Repeat
yeah yeah that's fine.	Accept
even if the general kind is the same the exact instances are different.	Expansions of y/n Answers

is this for a voiced segment?	Yes-No-question
but you might want to this is rip off a bunch of the slides on the	Offer

i have a quick question about microphones.	About-task
it's better than a	Assessment/Appreciation

it's slow.	Assessment/Appreciation
if somebody does we maybe we add that.	Offer
yeah pretty much.	Accept
that's that's really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time.	Assessment/Appreciation
so the speech recognizer also works.	Collaborative Completion
so we could have eight.	Statement
so i'll i'll listen to it and find out since you'd actually split it up by segment.	Commit
but it gives us a nice handle.	Assessment/Appreciation
wish you a good trip.	Topic Change
oh right oh that's	Acknowledge-answer
okay what what are the different uh classes to to code uh the the overlap you will use?	Floor Grabber
the action schemas basically have extra	Statement
no this is the useful.	Downplayer
and so you know a couple times they got it wrong.	Expansions of y/n Answers
huh so it's just uh the next two where there will be there you know may as well be meetings.	Statement
like in conversation analysis i've never heard people use this.	Defending/Explanation
so you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated uh within themselves.	Defending/Explanation
roughly yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh this is the composition of the dictionary.	Statement
right which should be pretty straight forward.	Accept
uh or or and the trajector should be coming in there as well.	Offer
no just kidding.	Downplayer
do this in perl.	Self-talk
well maybe maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful.	Floor Grabber
i don't want to make people self conscious.	Defending/Explanation
and i'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition.	Statement
but but you know i haven't spoken with them about that recently.	Defending/Explanation
you you put it over the corner of your ear.	Rising Tone
i'm just ignorant about the software architecture of this thing.	Defending/Explanation
what does c v s do if they if they do overlap?	Wh-Question
chicken run.	Statement
well the term itself is.	Negative Non-no Answers
so so there's a mike that plugs in	Understanding Check
yeah it's different.	Floor Grabber
the but there are some issues of this timing um in the recordings.	Negative Non-no Answers
but i guess if you're keeping the number of gaussians fixed in the recognizer then	Statement
so you'd the source would be outside and path is to the door or whatever.	Statement
that's true we could just subset it.	Accept
we don't know them perfectly but we know that some kinds use more memory and and some other kinds use more computation.	Rising Tone
yeah but presumably most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they're embedded in the heavy overlap section.	Floor Grabber
well we have steps forward.	Dispreferred Answers
and you're playing around with this.	Statement
what is it that you're supposed to do better than.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh yeah there's that pressure.	Acknowledge-answer
at nine nine frames of	Expansions of y/n Answers

if it's you know if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing	Rising Tone
but with the neural network.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i'm just thinking that from a data keeping track of the data point of view it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces.	Statement
do we want the schemas just blump blump blump blump?	Rising Tone
there's all sorts of stuff going on.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because they weren't working with meeting type data.	Defending/Explanation
it was two three weeks for training up for the large broadcast news test set training set.	Statement
so i guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date johno.	Rising Tone
it can't match up the	Statement
and then they could just fill that in.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and so i think it was it was it was very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say hey i know i'm doing something that isn't kosher.	Statement
yet.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's actually probably the right thing to do.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah you can	Accept
yeah nobody will remember how to repair a jimbox or a jimlet or a	Floor Grabber
that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the i guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to i b m?	Rising Tone
oh oh i see okay fine.	Acknowledge-answer
and then when you want to build the p files you just want to get one of those files off each of the sessions.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and and it'll be because it's being segmented as channel at a time with his with thilo's new procedure.	Statement
and then it's construed as something.	Statement
we tested uh trying to go down.	Expansions of y/n Answers
this happened.	Downplayer
where are we?	About-task
we should if you were having problems with the words we should figure out why.	Offer
we're discussing this.	About-task
that would just be info on or location?	Understanding Check
um that's kind of a contentious point between the two of us.	Floor Holder

one mean for the silence and one for the speech.	Expansions of y/n Answers
some s s h tunneled c v s.	Expansions of y/n Answers

yeah we started with hand marked data or with uh you know hand transcribed data.	Accept
do you mean the kind that hang from the ear sort of thing?	Understanding Check
uh this seems like an obvious mistake or something.	Defending/Explanation
and then after that then this would probably work.	Assessment/Appreciation
so then the bayes net that would merge there that would make the decision between go there info on and location would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted.	Statement
and we should go around the room at one of the tuesday lunch meetings and say you know what what was good about the conference.	Commit
it's not that we need it to be automatic.	Statement
it's just really the language is awful.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then we can uh possibly run one of them uh transformations?	Understanding Check
okay which is a a a lapel.	Floor Holder
okay then i will just go do that.	Acknowledge-answer
and we have a real interesting subject which is ron kay.	Rising Tone
but but that might be useful just for speech.	Floor Holder
so i think the right thing to do for that is figure out how to do c v s without uh compromising security.	Offer
oh not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel.	Negative Non-no Answers
uh that's fifteen d b below the maximum energy of the utterance.	Expansions of y/n Answers
do you have the mean for the auto correlation?	Repeat
um we would really need ideally a transcriber to time mark the you know the at least the beginning and ends of contiguous speech.	Floor Holder
three?	Understanding Check
cold calling at lunch time uh dinner time i mean.	Statement
okay so we can promote enter view all all up a bit.	Floor Grabber
so we need to have some mechanism for um handling changes in the future.	Offer
uhhuh!	Exclamation
let's talk about that for a second maybe.	Offer
i can hear it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but in this case it's really like there's a means that you know for achieving some other purpose.	Statement
they're supposed to imagine that you know do they think the person wants to go there or just know where it is.	Rising Tone
huh and	Floor Grabber
it was just adding noise.	Defending/Explanation
okay so we're okay we're still okay for another couple days then.	Acknowledge-answer
i guess the trouble in my mind is that it that it's not a very neat corpus.	Assessment/Appreciation
i'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone's still using it.	Statement
we're running a little short here.	Statement
so um in particular i was thinking um in in the hybrid framework just taking those l n a files and um setting to zero those probabilities that um that these phones are not voicing.	Floor Holder
you mean javier's?	Understanding Check
was was was hynek involved?	Rising Tone
um it's very important to normalize c zero.	Floor Holder
yeah it's it's interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
or you only have a million words for your some new task.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so we could compare before and after.	Offer
see i should listen.	Commit
but this is a technical detail.	Statement
especially the batteried meter popping up.	Statement

kind of a different level of analysis.	Assessment/Appreciation
that would help get them synchronized.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
there were other other people also who didn't fill out the speaker forms in addition to the n s as.	Expansions of y/n Answers

that kind of thing?	Declarative-Question
if it's two hundred if we shaved off twenty we could we could uh meet it by moving the delta back.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah the first one.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and then you have a markov model for each?	Declarative-Question
so what would we do for training?	Rising Tone
i mean longer term if it's if it turns out to be useful one one might want to do something else.	Offer
and log of	Self-talk
can i i i just	Yes-No-question
oh you want a lexical example.	Acknowledge-answer

i'll send an email.	Commit
not not unless you really really want to.	Accept-part
yeah the linear fit.	Accept
but for for scoring you can do it or not do it as you choose.	Statement

but if that's the hypothesis at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that.	Defending/Explanation
how far is it from here.	Statement
but isn't	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

maybe i i've heard this at i c s l p for years and years and years though.	Maybe
well they have a choice.	Floor Grabber
so do you have more stephane?	Rising Tone
all of these adaptations	Collaborative Completion
that's true i guess.	Accept
i i don't know enough about it.	Other Answers
no actually	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i wanted to ask one other question which is a different matter.	About-task
that and the correlation between stuff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh do we know about disk?	Floor Grabber
so our	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

so this is almost ten percent.	Statement
that hangs has the mike on it.	Statement
what do you what do you	Wh-Question
on mel scale twenty twenty critical bands and then loudness.	Statement
maybe that's a better place to go.	Statement
and then when you get the spectrum the average complex spectrum um actually divide it out.	Defending/Explanation
okay but more emphasis on the computational or emphasis on the linguist?	Acknowledge-answer
so we switch off with this?	Declarative-Question
maybe that they're a lot worse.	Defending/Explanation
and for that well the goal is to obtain um estimate a p d f for the noisy speech.	Rising Tone
we will not end this discussion anytime soon.	Commit
this is the uh what the action planner uses?	Understanding Check
high low is pretty straightforward.	Assessment/Appreciation
but if you if you go from the well matched case to the medium it's not an enormous difference in the in the the training testing situation.	Repeat

well reference is one thing.	Downplayer
river street.	Statement
yeah we can do it this week.	Accept
the best that we can get that means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances.	Mimic Other
yeah we were talking about that.	Acknowledge-answer
and how much of it is just due to the fact that you're not accurately finding enough regions that that are really noise?	Wh-Question
um so the delta at the end is how much?	Floor Grabber
so that's uh	Statement
um i'd like someone who's more familiar with it to look at it.	Offer
this is wonderful to have a direct contact like that.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then they have to transcribe what that number is each time.	Statement
well if we don't have anything else to discuss we should uh turn off the machine and then say the real nasty things.	Floor Holder
or the tell me something about.	Expansions of y/n Answers
babble it's a stationary background plus some voices.	Statement
and he can weigh in as well.	Statement

which one is these?	Rising Tone
well it's okay.	Floor Grabber
that's not clear.	Negative Non-no Answers
people have the inverse problem with my name.	Statement
so which which meetings what meetings do we have?	Wh-Question

no no i'm sorry.	Reject
oh you did wear it this morning?	Rising Tone

everybody likes action.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh the yeah the the mikes in the middle the head mounted mikes the lapel mikes the array uh with	Floor Holder
eva?	Declarative-Question
uh out of curiosity is there a reason why we wouldn't combine these three nodes into one smaller subnet?	Floor Grabber
and so it would be much better to get uh dave gelbart to do that than me.	Statement
i wasn't planning on doing it simultaneously.	Dispreferred Answers
and then doing group slightly differently.	Offer
and that works fine.	Assessment/Appreciation
but it's just that it it it does seem to be uh a lot of work to do a good job on on that.	Defending/Explanation
but if it's a problem of extra beeps rather than missing beeps then um that's easier.	Defending/Explanation
um somehow putting in the the uh the perfect knowledge that i have about voicing.	Floor Holder
so basically you'd have a decision tree query go there?	Understanding Check
yeah because it doesn't just follow what's there.	Floor Grabber
using the the noise at the beginning of the sentence.	Expansions of y/n Answers
just the clip.	Negative Non-no Answers
but y is what?	Declarative-Question
but but for but for	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

it's the same as in the the smoother for the i b m thing.	Rising Tone
i mean make it a hundred or so?	Understanding Check

i thought that one thing with the h.t.k. is that is has the as we're using the configuration we're using is is being bound by the terms of aurora.	Statement
i don't know if i'm going to answer your question or not with this.	Downplayer
i mean it's if we can actually you know get it so that we can out of one utterance activate more than one schema i mean then we're already pretty good.	Statement
he said it's hard to find things you say wrong.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right so if we if we fed the hand segmentation to javier's and it doesn't work then we know something's wrong.	Floor Grabber
about heads?	Collaborative Completion
but it sounded like they were pretty well thought out.	Statement
if well you in a to a broader audience you could call it a diagnostic experiment rather than a cheating experiment.	Floor Grabber
yeah it's a schematic tourist map.	Accept
so you just scroll a screen and it would you know go kur chunk!	Exclamation
so do you maybe make errors in different places?	Rising Tone
it will it will miss	Statement
um so you know in in principle then it'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this.	Floor Holder
yeah something like with their cell phones.	Accept
and it's sort of a a hack but i mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form.	Defending/Explanation
uh well at least with the current on line normalization scheme.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is that because the transcripts get longer?	Rising Tone
so forth.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh but other than that you're you're basically done.	Floor Holder
um well that's that's one one thing is that we can link up.	Floor Holder
well to to obtain a statistical model on these features.	Floor Holder
you know give them a little cue about where they are.	Statement
which means that it's it's doing a slightly better job than the previous v.a.d.	Expansions of y/n Answers

is it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very uh sort of abstract things?	Rising Tone
this is one.	Statement
as long as you're not wearing your your headphones.	Collaborative Completion
well first you have to filter the whole training set and re train.	Offer
i don't see your point.	Negative Non-no Answers
each module will try have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh you know entity can have which parents.	Statement
and maybe they have the native code compiler or something.	Statement

but then we we should firm it up by next next thursday's meeting.	Action-directive
oh it's it's a	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah that's funny.	Accept
well okay so the limits of the of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful.	Floor Holder
and so what i'm doing is um putting in the stream reader into the quicknet libraries for the s r i feature files.	Statement

there's a k.l.t. after the neural network as as before.	Dispreferred Answers
uh you know on the same channel the same speaker.	Floor Holder
because it was like a weird feature set.	Defending/Explanation

but this helps a lot.	Assessment/Appreciation
seems like you should be able to spawn that off into a background process.	Statement
that's connected.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah so that's one of the slides they put up.	Statement
okay well i feel better now.	About-task
and just hand over the ones where we have a winner.	Offer
it's a weighted average.	Statement
so you need the word you need the word to sort of control the relative location.	Defending/Explanation

i don't know about that.	Dispreferred Answers
we can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount.	Defending/Explanation
but you could always send me comments per electronic mail.	Rising Tone
so so these i mean the in the in the speech side the thing that always occurs to me is that if you	Floor Holder
because they don't have these you know mismatches that that you guys have.	Defending/Explanation
um uh that's one one aspect of it.	Floor Holder
it's in	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
we could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it.	Offer
yeah maybe we can add some context from these features also as dan did in in his last work.	Acknowledge-answer
you mean you want to cheat.	Statement
um we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones.	Floor Grabber
um actually is there a way though to use whatever you're using for background noise to check post hoc that a microphone was constantly on?	Yes-No-question
per utterance.	Acknowledge-answer
you assume everything's equal.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so since they have these three categories it seems like the reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those.	Floor Holder
so you're talking about tightening up time boundaries.	Understanding Check
yeah oh.	Continuer
and maybe you've posted it before.	Statement
yeah to decide which one is	Floor Grabber
we have lots of choices of microphones.	Statement
a lot of different ones.	Statement
uh with something that's still relatively realistic it's still very very hard to do very well.	Floor Holder
because even a casual user can always send email to whoever's in charge.	Defending/Explanation
which is a hard task.	Assessment/Appreciation
i know you're willing to not work for an hour.	Humorous Material

middle june?	Declarative-Question
and then you know somebody either the computer or the user says all right well i know i want to do a source path goal action so what are my choices among that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there's identity basically between things?	Floor Holder
so is the only reason we can make all these smaller bayes nets because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions?	Rising Tone

um might be nice because we save those out already um to be able to do that.	Floor Holder

well right i i just did ten per page i could easily do twenty per page.	Floor Grabber
looks like it.	Expansions of y/n Answers

just say speaker one or	Offer

uh currently um we use special words.	Floor Holder
so there's a lot of things to work with.	Floor Holder

we should add him.	Offer
okay because then once we have it sort of up and running then we can start you know defining the interfaces.	Accept

because people i mean there isn't going to be just one system that people train on.	Defending/Explanation
i think uh i mean uh my guess is that means it's just that if it's if it's near field the mathematics of beam beam steering is different.	Statement
uh so the the right now the the system that is there in the what we have in the repositories with uses fifteen.	Floor Grabber
which will probably be richer and fuller and have other stuff in there.	Assessment/Appreciation
well and the other thing is maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process	Floor Grabber
what are they doing?	Wh-Question
that would probably be uh sufficient to train models.	Statement
sort of feed you back to our original problem.	Rising Tone
but i think i think that um um it's probably best to start talking with him just to	Offer
so that the um the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kinds of things you would have to do?	Understanding Check

because otherwise i was going to say we have to cancel.	Defending/Explanation
so there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion.	Statement
yeah can you go back to that one?	Acknowledge-answer
yeah i mean but there's a good question here.	Floor Grabber
so what i was thinking is we could get a few more of the sony ones.	Offer
for instance just the fact that people sit in different positions different times.	Defending/Explanation
so uh so we would we would instantiate the s p g schema with a source path goal blah blah blah.	Floor Holder
and so this is saying well if you really do have that sort of vocal tract envelope and you subtract that off what you get is the excitation.	Statement
well i mean it looks better.	Downplayer
one of the experiments we're going to do is um we're going to um train the a broadcast news net.	Commit
you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline.	Statement

and and the thing i i have in mind is uh maybe you'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse.	Defending/Explanation

and for the last three rounds they do seven iterations of re estimation in each of those three.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh you i think in some case you got some little improvement.	Floor Holder

it's too hard usually.	Assessment/Appreciation
each time that i detect noise.	Expansions of y/n Answers

are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation?	Yes-No-question

i mean you could just take the best system and say that's the standard.	Offer
which you know isn't relevant to the scoring of the speech recognition output.	Statement

you're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the sonys.	Understanding Check

italy huh?	Rising Tone
and and then see if when they're breathing it's showing.	Defending/Explanation
um a third thing is um that instead of having a fixed time constant i try to have a time constant that's smaller at the beginning of the utterances.	Floor Holder
yeah i was going to say like	Accept
estimate the new mean and the variance of the noisy speech.	Rising Tone
another one just bit the dust.	3rd-party-talk
we've got lots of bits of noise.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

two two fifteen hundred.	Collaborative Completion
instead of channelizing and having the uh uh you know elaborate coding of the backchannels.	Offer

uh regardless of of of the input	Statement
so if we if we were then it seems like giving them something whatever they had gotten up to would be better than nothing.	Statement

so um since we have a bit farther to travel than some of the others uh we'll have to get done a little quicker.	Floor Holder
well well.	Assessment/Appreciation

we have all those parameters just set as they are.	Statement

it seems to me we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting.	Offer
so running out of it definitely has a process aspect to it.	Statement

they're sort of separate.	Accept-part
well if they if they record a meeting and they create a key file and they find an error in their key file they shouldn't have to tell us about that.	Defending/Explanation
it's just saying if it's in this corpus it's correct.	Statement
yeah you you you can.	Accept
they were doing similar enough things.	Understanding Check

that is right.	Accept

is there an extra copy around?	Rising Tone

no whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript.	Reject
um it seems to improve on the well matched case.	Floor Holder

you'd like so you're saying you could practically turn this structure inside out?	Understanding Check

so is the end of the month still the the	Understanding Check
um if you do a second term does it get too complicated because of the nonlinearity?	Floor Holder
it's fixed the dictionary.	Defending/Explanation
i know for a fact that one of those she could really well she could judge what what the number was based on the on the waveform.	Floor Holder
but this doesn't hurt.	Defending/Explanation
yeah you oh and each of these words has a dedicated phone.	Accept
doing this kind of thing is pretty robust to noise?	Rising Tone
oh when how many constructions do people have?	Understanding Check
i thought he's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it.	Understanding Check
is this are these twenty-millisecond frames?	Rising Tone
so out of these these high level categories the subject can pick a couple.	Rising Tone
and um how we can make it work for us.	Rising Tone
you've got to have a saturday overnight.	Defending/Explanation
and so i did some some modifications in those parameters.	Defending/Explanation
so it i mean all i'm saying is whatever our input is we're always going to get the full output.	Reformulate/Summarize
like every time i say it it's horrible.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean it's going to be terrible.	Assessment/Appreciation
but let me give you the opposite argument.	Action-directive
but it's it's unfortunately this is not really something a tourist would ever say.	Negative Non-no Answers
i mean we tried a lot of things in a hurry.	Statement
it seems quite robust to noise.	Statement
i i may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that i've always viewed things.	Rising Tone
yeah you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we're having say on speechdat-car.	Acknowledge-answer
okay so sorry.	Acknowledge-answer
i am doing something like an adaptation of the noise.	Defending/Explanation
but as far as the orthogonalizing transformation you were trying that at one point right?	Understanding Check
a lot of people ask that if they actually just want to go there.	Defending/Explanation
well that's one way to do it.	Accept-part
there's there's	Statement
well ryan could come.	Floor Holder

the other thing one could do is couldn't	Offer

where where's it going to be this year?	Rising Tone
um so it's makes forty five features that are used as input to the h.t.k.	Floor Holder

probably not transcripts.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well that's that's debatable.	Maybe
forget about the ones where it's all sort of middle ground.	Offer
so there's a bit a redundancy.	Understanding Check
that that's one computation i did for sixteen channels sixteen bit.	Statement
might want to say.	Offer
are we going to i mean is it going to be over there or is it going to be in there?	Rising Tone
so that's what's going to happen.	Understanding Check
so there's a question of how easy or how hard to modify.	Statement
anyone here?	Rising Tone
but one one would think that each it	Statement
i have the mean.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
okay i guess what i'm i'm thinking is just in if uh when these are presented in an interdisciplinary context it might be nice to add that explanation.	Acknowledge-answer

okay so this is morgan.	Floor Grabber
because the the histogram for the the	Defending/Explanation
or a plus b is not the um log of e to the a plus e to the b.	Misspeak Self-Correction

so there's there's the continuing process of cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that.	About-task
uh because he's been in europe.	Defending/Explanation
um i was thinking more like using them as as the inputs to to the detectors.	Floor Grabber
but it was marginally better with this configuration.	Defending/Explanation
like when people do this kind of thing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's oh okay so they're not talking about how far apart the mikes are they're talking about how far they are from the speaker.	Acknowledge-answer
an expert can't even tell what they're talking about.	Statement
but the speechdat-car data that you're seeing is also reduced in noise.	Negative Non-no Answers
i have to to check that.	Defending/Explanation
because you have to know which ones match which.	Defending/Explanation
well so so that's something that the transcribers will have to have to do.	Floor Grabber
or if i try to make it work on that it's just the italian or something it doesn't work on the finnish.	Defending/Explanation
did we did we spend our the budget already that we had?	Rising Tone

aurora has a clean subset.	Statement

you're saying it's it's about an hour meeting.	Understanding Check
no more qualifiers than that.	Expansions of y/n Answers

but walked into the cafe and ordered a drink and walked into the cafe and broke his nose.	Negative Non-no Answers
so do you want to say something about that?	Floor Holder
um the i mean i i in principle i could imagine writing a script which would approximate it to some degree.	Floor Holder
and may not.	Downplayer
where you include the beeps as words and pretty much figure out where the errors are.	Statement
so um you can scale it down by	Floor Holder
they should come when they're done their stuff basically whenever that is.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
the idea is so imagine we have a library of schema.	Statement
make make sure carmen talks as well.	Action-directive
because here the f f t is only with two hundred fifty six point.	Defending/Explanation
but it it matters more in some situations than in others.	Rising Tone
i'm thinking also a about dan's work where he he trained a network not on phoneme targets but on the h.m.m. state targets.	Statement
or if it's below	Or-Clause
i got this crazy idea that um in the future people will just walk around with the microphones that they use for their cell phones.	Rising Tone
well we should be able to just go buy some preamps i would think.	Offer
we just want to show.	Statement
it's a shame we can't do that.	Assessment/Appreciation
okay so we're degenerating.	Floor Grabber
uh so it goes to two.	Statement
but anyway i'm i'm open to our consideration.	About-task
then uh whhh	Statement
and someone else sort of implied that well we you know all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are.	Statement
because that's yet another	Defending/Explanation
um so when we put some noise compensation the um l d a filter that that's derived from noisy speech is not more anymore optimal.	Floor Holder
i mean if it's two if if it's uh if it's two fifty then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty.	Expansions of y/n Answers

other than lengthening the transcript i think it would be very helpful.	Assessment/Appreciation

and what i did so far is i just used our old munich system.	Floor Holder
nice meetings by the way.	Assessment/Appreciation
that's what i was saying earlier.	Statement

can you hand me your digit form?	Action-directive

um i've been playing with first the um v.a.d.	Floor Grabber

you on friday or on saturday?	Declarative-Question
so um everything that we did could probably just be added on to what alcatel did.	Floor Holder
i mean that's more of an information kind of thing.	Defending/Explanation
i'll ask her if she can track some of them down.	Commit
uh because because we've had with the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time uh we've really had no no trouble with this at all.	Defending/Explanation

i don't think we'll go much longer.	Statement

okay great well thanks a lot.	Assessment/Appreciation
well that'll teach them to roll their window up.	Humorous Material
is that the band center?	Rising Tone

and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on.	Defending/Explanation
i have here the same frame for the clean speech.	Rising Tone
that's all i have.	About-task
yeah although it it it it may be separating out these numbers from the rest.	Accept
um and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segments to	Floor Holder
um i wouldn't well it they didn't say hate.	Floor Grabber
well um maybe once we have this noise compensation i don't know we have to try that also whether we want to go for c zero or log energy.	Floor Holder
should we start on thursday?	Rising Tone
and they're certainly going to want to change tools.	Statement
maybe we can figure out how long it'll take to to do	Offer
that'd be	Statement

i think that's sort of the big deal.	Assessment/Appreciation
okay so we're live.	Statement
the proposal one.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh we can write that the estimation of the clean speech is equal at an expected value of the clean speech conditional to uh the noise signal the probability of the the statistic of the clean speech and the statistic of the noise.	Repeat
um i mean on the one hand um sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there.	Floor Holder
or we could mix we could mix the the headset mikes you know just to make a single high high quality.	Offer

no it's makes sense to look at low frequencies.	Statement
i could send brian the um the transcript.	Statement
you're never going to be copying them around and making working copies of them.	Defending/Explanation
because often the recording person isn't in the room.	Defending/Explanation

oh oh yeah yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah you can get that.	Accept
uh we ran out.	Defending/Explanation
just sort of okay what what what would you like to buy.	Statement
so fifty three is what you were getting with the old v.a.d.	Understanding Check
yeah yeah i guess.	Statement
and it's going to part of the m three l a p a p i filed by the end of this year.	Rising Tone
i can calculate i can i calculated this value uh with the statistic of the noisy speech that i calculated before with the v t s approximation.	Rising Tone
but um i mean it's just tracing down these bugs.	Floor Holder
i mean what do you embed it in?	Wh-Question
so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it	Offer
instead of just having uh those cleaned up cepstrum should we feed some additional information like the the	Yes-No-question

i don't think we could do it on the mixed signal.	Rising Tone

but i don't think we need to do that in this meeting.	Statement
and on and on the um um t.i. digits also?	Declarative-Question
and we're going.	Statement
and if we look at the result that sunil sent just putting the v a d in the baseline improved like more than twenty percent.	Rising Tone
and then it's going to be even much nicer.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's only the first try.	Defending/Explanation
well five with wireless.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the thesis proposal you got	Statement
yeah it does look good.	Accept

what happen with the second step?	Wh-Question
about plato and the book?	Understanding Check
um i mean when when the uh the neural net uh wave hit in the mid-eighties	Floor Holder
well but you have a choice.	Defending/Explanation
but that's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels.	Statement
so are do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically or as word models or what?	Open-Question
well that would be good.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh we we know that for example the log of e plus b is equal to log of e plus log to b.	Statement
well i i i mean i don't know.	Other Answers
very good.	Assessment/Appreciation
no it does not the c v s doesn't work that way.	Reject
yeah so it's coming along.	Floor Grabber
so so i mean that was that was kind of you know it's a good point.	Floor Holder
which i can even email you then.	Offer
it shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that uh and i also wouldn't think the c p u uh would be much either for that part.	Statement
because for all kinds of studies we don't really enjoy meetings where some of the where the signal's going off at times.	Defending/Explanation
you used thirteen.	Expansions of y/n Answers
still it's possible that we're getting in some more noise.	Statement
so maybe we should maybe we should do a uh simultaneous digits digits read in the interest of of getting the snacks.	Offer
and at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them what is the output of the recognizer.	Statement
would they both be listed here in	Yes-No-question
and the thing is it's not just a pure average because there are these weightings.	Statement
however not only was the common census were among all participants of friday's meeting was it's going to be very laborious to to make these drawings for each different things.	Rising Tone
um so that's a nice feature of what what we did.	Floor Holder
over a meeting that no person has ever listened to or transcribed.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks.	Floor Holder
but i would think that's what you want to do.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh why i added more mixtures for for the speech.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and if it's if	Statement

well i don't know what you want to do yeah.	Statement
i i i think it's kind of arbitrary too.	Assessment/Appreciation
click	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but i i it it it's all worth looking at.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well yeah actually it's it's not the the l d a filter.	Statement
uh throwing away the first?	Understanding Check
why twenty eight?	Rising Tone
so it's not the same.	Defending/Explanation
well it sort of was.	Floor Grabber
well i mean we have we are transferring the v.a.d. to the back end.	Statement
i can get it in here.	Repeat
for adaptation right.	Mimic Other
so so okay.	Floor Grabber
t i digits was one of them and uh wall street journal.	Rising Tone

log of x omega.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you know you know where	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
well i guess what i'm thinking of is that that a lot of times there will be they'll put in question marks that represent some unknown amount of speech.	Floor Grabber
and we're going to try out that.	Statement
oh it doesn't have it doesn't have any temporal uh	Understanding Check
well we could.	Accept-part
the one that we we submitted the last round?	Understanding Check
i i i there's no not much difference between the the one second and the two second one.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah sometimes things belong and	Floor Holder
how they're doing it.	Acknowledge-answer
that sounds great.	Assessment/Appreciation
and in a sense that was cheating.	Statement
in somebody else's turn.	Statement
but uh it's there's a mismatch between the car conditions.	Floor Holder
so i i will be i mean he's taking a very early flight.	Statement
yeah well that we can do something about.	Floor Grabber
what what do they need to do left?	Rising Tone
um is	Floor Holder
also these things may or may not get their own structure in the future.	Floor Grabber
just plain p.l.p.'s or m.f.c.c.'s.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so on average we could we don't we we wouldn't use all the channels necessarily.	Statement
yeah some of these things are captured by yeah um by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever.	Floor Grabber
and i i think that it's um	Statement
so to to uh actually um uh specify the the tasks.	Statement
and i don't want that to happen.	Statement
because i couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector.	Statement
v t s.	Mimic Other
which uh you know is a pretty low frequency kind of thing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well i think the reason they can do that is that they assumed that text that they get off the web like from wall street journal is correct and edit it.	Floor Grabber
oh yes but this is not important.	Accept
it it's going to be imperfect.	Statement
so is the idea that you're going to take whatever features you develop and and just add them onto the future vector?	Understanding Check
and so they did like you know eight different methods that everybody you know uh argues about about oh my my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine.	Statement
i might not work.	Self-talk
is that what you get?	Expansions of y/n Answers
um for those who don't know	Floor Holder
so the so the the mouth noise uh word has just a single phone.	Defending/Explanation
if you uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i don't think it can handle french.	Humorous Material
you can back everything out.	3rd-party-talk
was it that many?	Rising Tone
so brian did tell me that in fact what you said that uh that our	Statement

and check the segmentations.	Collaborative Completion
overlaps are uh not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and uh detailed a way as it might be.	Statement
they prefer to have them on.	Statement
okay i will.	Acknowledge-answer
and so i thought at first um that uh what i should do is unwrap the phase.	Statement
about what?	Rising Tone
and and you and you train it up entirely from uh nonspeech sections in the test?	Understanding Check
then aligns things.	Statement
okay so you might as well run the automatic thing over the entire meeting.	Offer
they can be very different.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so it's only the highly mismatched.	Statement
uh they they think it's a terrific improvement.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
we uh i with a i looked with a student i looked at the entire database that we have on heidelberg for cases of metonymy.	Rising Tone
okay okay all right.	Acknowledge-answer
so how does	Wh-Question

oh hang on.	Action-directive
so that this means we can start using it basically now.	Statement
um i had another question briefly about transcription.	Floor Holder
they felt they wanted to set a limit.	Statement
let their	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

this is being sent.	Statement
i mean should we feed the v.a.d. flag also at the input so that it it has some additional discriminating information at the input?	Yes-No-question
but i what i'm saying is what's between the beeps we don't really care about.	Defending/Explanation
so they do it right at the beginning of the semester.	Statement
right but it'll it'll grab the next beep in other words.	Acknowledge-answer
that would be a really interesting prosodic feature.	Assessment/Appreciation
am i missing something here?	Rising Tone
so should we simply assert that this week we are recognition and next week data issues?	Rising Tone
is the t is egual is equal to uh log of	Statement
right but if you	Accept
oh oh oh i see.	Acknowledge-answer
um the right now i'm using the unadapted models for the forced alignments.	Floor Holder
i really would like to suggest looking um a little bit at the kinds of errors.	Offer
or what is the situation type?	Rising Tone
you know and and naturally everything gets	Floor Holder
do we have an e d u meeting at four?	Yes-No-question
this is the left side of the dummy p d a and this would be the right side.	Statement
because i read halfway but i didn't see a castle thing.	Statement

these actions	Statement

not of the	Understanding Check
that's not that bad.	Defending/Explanation
so where do the outputs of the net go into if you're doing phone recognition?	Rising Tone
because some of them will be wrong.	Defending/Explanation
eventually we could could just	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah i guess it's the power spectrum of noisy speech.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i mean we could try it.	Offer
yeah that was an interesting discussion.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh so it's two hundred and ten.	Floor Holder
does you have any thoughts about what else you're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time?	Rising Tone
aren't we always computing all?	Understanding Check
yeah i was just thinking that actually temporally just uh uh uh an increasing tones so that	Floor Holder
so with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule.	Understanding Check
then you have to say it's either one of them.	Rising Tone
what kind of filter is that?	Rising Tone
are you saying that all of these estimates are done using um estimates of the probability density for the noise that are calculated only from the first ten frames?	Understanding Check
timit uh phone recognition with timit.	Expansions of y/n Answers
get you can get the uh you can get it to switch audio?	Understanding Check
that way there's lots of work to do.	Humorous Material
uh it seems like a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
does it make sense to try to take what we have now which are the ones that you know we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time tightened and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings or is it better to just you know forget that and	Or-Question
well we don't it doesn't need to be backed up.	Statement
okay but that means that you're going to have to be available for people all the time who say there's an error here.	Acknowledge-answer
but you said it was somewhat better say five percent better for the first two conditions and fifteen percent worse for the other one?	Understanding Check
it's not so easy to find.	Rising Tone
for for even feature normalization for uh vocal tract length estimation	Expansions of y/n Answers

it's i think it's whitening this the portion that are more silent.	Statement
um so is it a fixed number or or do you leave it open it could be between one and fifteen?	Rising Tone

hang a five pound weight off the off the back.	Humorous Material

i i guess i don't remember either.	Other Answers
because viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and or actually going from one place to another to take a picture in this in a	Defending/Explanation

and ugh!	Exclamation
and anybody doing this task uh is going to have some sort of voice activity detection at some level in some way.	Defending/Explanation
and maybe some major streets and their names.	Rising Tone
well no okay the question i still have about what we're going to do is what is what uh okay so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we're in a situation where we can with you know ten minutes of preparation we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording.	Reject
and the reason is um if i understand that cheating is a term which is used to apply for basically what all of linguistics corpus linguistics does and what what my transcribers are doing and what i do which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark things in the data.	Statement
delta at input to net?	Understanding Check

oh in the presentation here.	Statement
but we could talk about this stuff.	Offer
do you think the battery ran out?	Rising Tone
are are is it a small enough group that they would could just have accounts?	Yes-No-question
if you add more data?	Rising Tone
so it's a very simple change to make.	Defending/Explanation
so you're saying feed that also into the neural net.	Understanding Check
that's actually what i thought of loading the chopped up waveforms i mean you know that that would make it faster.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
rad's a great term.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then it's i b m.	Expansions of y/n Answers

when we look at at the um m f c c that result from this they are a lot more smoother.	Rising Tone

you know there's arguments on both sides.	Statement
okay so whatever people sort of wear to use	Floor Grabber
oh yeah you do.	Dispreferred Answers

uh and we also have these we have the advantage of having distant mikes too.	Floor Holder
of sorts.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right so it's really it would be really easy to re do it.	Floor Grabber
i don't know if we can get some hand labeled data from other languages.	Other Answers
but it would be	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and actually you want them large.	Expansions of y/n Answers
does does the h go before the a or after the a?	Or-Question
no well.	Reject
the trouble is that	Statement
so uh as a result of that we have a reduced um transmission rate for the bits.	Floor Holder
uh uh that's a good question actually.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
that's probably better.	Assessment/Appreciation
and don't let anyone check it out	Offer
you know i understand it in that context.	Defending/Explanation
so you essentially take the values that that you get from the triangular filter and extend them.	Understanding Check
so there is this the mismatched is um the same kind of thing.	Floor Grabber
that's sort of one level higher.	Defending/Explanation
how hard is it to repartition?	Wh-Question
let's so let's think about this from the point of view of construal.	Action-directive
so you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting in the sense that you know not everyone as you just said you won't be there.	Offer
and that's why the bindings become useful.	Statement
because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word.	Defending/Explanation
it was a little bit worse.	Dispreferred Answers
you cannot miss it.	Repeat
well but all we'll get	Floor Grabber
maybe maybe you're going to run a trial tomorrow.	Statement
or even i could you know i could do the actual	Offer

because i i am finding that um in double checking i've run across um one data set where the microphone was off early on.	Statement
problem is if you are going to run this on different test sets including large vocabulary.	Negative Non-no Answers
all right thanks.	Thanking
it's like i mean shastri would say you know binding is like an essential cognitive uh process.	Statement
bo eep be oop!	Exclamation
i don't think that would work.	Statement
oh so just from clustering you might be able to cluster it better because of that.	Acknowledge-answer
i think that's correct.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

oops i'm sorry.	Apology
no no no but not for your talk.	Reject
i don't know if that's something that i should do when i look over it or if we want someone else to do or whatever.	Offer

you know i mean here's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity.	Floor Grabber
i'm sorry i don't	Apology

what what we need is a just a mechanism that says aha there is	Offer

yeah susan lindner.	Floor Grabber
you can compute uh the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes given some other nodes.	Defending/Explanation

right now it's a weighting on on improvement.	Statement
so so i think using a a good aligner um actually can can help a lot.	Reformulate/Summarize
the opposite argument is you're never really going to have a good sample of all these different things.	Statement
there're times when i want to hear the mixed signal.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i don't know if she knows about it.	Other Answers
also um	Floor Holder
so that would be even that wouldn't change this number down here to sixty two?	Understanding Check
because you're doing these canonical mappings from timit labelings.	Defending/Explanation
i mean it only takes to run the the two test sets in just in computer time is just a day or so.	Statement
what's the situation like at the entity that is mentioned?	Rising Tone
i'm changing this.	Statement
i think the hope would be that it would uh it would work well for the good cases.	Statement

i mean you know you you do whatever you want.	Statement
in terms of not him doing it.	Expansions of y/n Answers

however the uh it seems to be sensible to me to to view them as mutually exclusive.	Rising Tone
they they they measure the relative importance of having different um portions of the modulation spectrum intact.	Statement
then when they're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know the start points and end points of overlaps.	Offer
so why does that smooth things out?	Wh-Question

oh oh you're downloading a whole meeting.	Acknowledge-answer
will we have time to um to prepare something that we in the format we were planning for the i b m transcribers by then?	Rising Tone
oh they can	Statement
little bit of noise.	Statement
and partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories.	Defending/Explanation
so when you're running things if you run it on the old	Statement
for the frame i guess.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
look at that struct in the output?	Understanding Check
i mean maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff we can just not use that.	Offer
so it's it's extremely important that the two of you are also present in this town during that time.	Statement
since i considered those preliminary i didn't.	Defending/Explanation
so i think they should be able to hear.	Statement
well huh	Floor Grabber
uh like speaker adaptation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
can you write unread on that?	3rd-party-talk
do it.	Action-directive
so so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say well if you really look at it you just need our rad.	Statement

is the cogsci department that you were talking about?	Rising Tone
which i compared.	Expansions of y/n Answers

i think it's a neat thing.	Assessment/Appreciation
how standard are these?	3rd-party-talk
it's based on things like uh there's going to be a node for go there or not and there's going to be a node for enter view approach.	Defending/Explanation

i leave in the afternoon.	Defending/Explanation
um i don't think say that as clearly as it could.	Floor Holder

but i mean the thing is if if uh if you're actually asking you know if you actually uh need to do place along an f f t it may be it may be pushing things.	Defending/Explanation
and now he's he's requiring it to be done first.	Defending/Explanation
oh rich	Acknowledge-answer
but what if you put ran the other kind of l.d.a. uh on your features right before they go into the h.m. m?	Wh-Question

they're putting uh so in curly brackets they put inhale or breath.	Statement
the reason is why i think it's a little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is	Defending/Explanation
meaning we can reference.	Statement
but that has nothing to do with what we're testing on right?	Understanding Check
and they have these tables with uh various language model weights insertion penalties.	Statement
and we still don't have the neural net in.	Statement
between you guys?	Understanding Check
okay so you probably did get that.	Acknowledge-answer
because yeah sunil told me that he was trying already to put some kind of uh filtering in the france telecom.	Defending/Explanation

it's just our our old munich uh loudness based spectrum.	Statement
we could skip the digits.	Offer

i don't see how that will work though.	Statement
what i mean is he's an active member and he's still here.	Statement
columbia have anything?	Declarative-Question

that's what that's what we're going to do next.	Defending/Explanation

whereas source is just an attribute?	Understanding Check
which is a million filter.	Expansions of y/n Answers

uh oh i i think i mentioned at the last meeting.	Floor Holder
i mean have someone do some routine whatever.	Offer

how's that how it can be finite again?	Rising Tone

do you how much of that do you think is due to just the particular implementation and how much you're adjusting it?	Rising Tone
that's copy and paste from something.	Offer
um but the the real point was that the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place.	Floor Holder
only with v t s and nothing more.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah we haven't done that.	Statement
and and and therefore you bring it in.	Statement
and that might help cue the transcriptionist.	Statement

what if you did the	Wh-Question

uh that's right that's right.	Accept
do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that?	Rising Tone
uh so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output.	Statement

he said that?	Understanding Check
well what i think you know would be more what you'd want to do is is is uh put it into another neural net.	Action-directive

but if you included uh broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases.	Offer
in the uh whatever.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data?	Rising Tone
maybe we can work on doing displaying multiple or displaying one and playing back the other.	Offer
well uh i guess the work that's been done on segmentation would be most.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
like when i	Expansions of y/n Answers
like this the you know short version.	Expansions of y/n Answers

pastry	Mimic Other
but anyway i i i think it's it's just the the it's it's it's not really the conclusion they came to so much as the conclusion that some of the uh uh commenters in the crowd came up with.	Topic Change
because they have this document explaining the recognizer.	Defending/Explanation
well some voiced sound can have also like a noisy part on high frequencies.	Defending/Explanation
you want to read?	Offer
but it sounds like a a a a short conversation with brian might be might be helpful to get a sense of what's going on.	Offer

the other thing that i just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you're supposed to meet your friend there or	Statement

it's weird.	Assessment/Appreciation
at that point where you can really lock a file.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh they're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between.	Defending/Explanation
one is just do like non lapels if we can get good enough alignments.	Statement
it's like if you say what's the what's the best way to do an average.	Expansions of y/n Answers

no because i mean if we i mean we're sure going to interface to we're going to get an x m l document from somewhere.	Reject
oh geez.	Assessment/Appreciation
right because if we have a fixed number of neurons.	Accept
so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session?	Understanding Check

is that a good characterization?	Rising Tone

reminds me of when when herve and i were first playing with uh context dependent things for nets.	Statement

in the future though the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action a domain object and a rich action description.	Statement

i'm going to read some numbers now.	Statement
more disk is better.	Dispreferred Answers

or more generally i guess what what is causing the degradation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
when you say it's a little worse.	Expansions of y/n Answers

probably getting some kind of single channel merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple sound file of some sort to a transcriber to deal with it rather than this massive thing.	About-task
on that one?	Understanding Check
that that yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
so are we worrying about that or not for now?	Or-Question
now you can all turn off your	Action-directive

is that power spectrum?	Rising Tone

that maybe that's an interface issue that might be addressable.	Maybe

and i wouldn't have to change the code.	Defending/Explanation
i'm talking about next week.	Negative Non-no Answers

it's the ratio?	Understanding Check

then it's something to do.	Statement
oh you can do that?	Maybe
and then average that with a weighting?	Understanding Check
with at least like at least with you know being able to search over certain amount of meetings.	Downplayer
they just chose that.	Statement

what it is is just that	Statement

forty eight kilohertz yeah.	Statement
for the to get this mapping.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so was the training set same as the the february proposal?	Rising Tone
so it would be considered valid if we have an s p g action enter and no s p g schema but a forced action schema.	Statement
whereas i think it's probably something pathologic.	Statement
i know that there's complication in the overlap sections and with the lapel mikes.	Statement

it's hard to find anything that you say in these.	Assessment/Appreciation

is it already?	Rising Tone
and the offices are in in the glass half dome.	Rising Tone

no i mean that there's no point in going through all of that if that's the bottom line really.	Defending/Explanation
i agree with that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

i really think it's better not to transcribe a meeting that's going to have problems once you've spent all this effort.	Offer
something that is transitional in nature.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and since we have one already um	Statement
but these are these are some good ideas i think.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah and and there will be a a a relatively high level of redundancy.	Floor Grabber
when you say we have that does sunil have it now too?	Understanding Check
so then you could use c v s.	Offer
and we really did get feedback from a few people some of whom were you know fairly senior that that um well you know you you you we're really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate.	Statement
but they don't run experiments.	Statement
how would we do that with the hybrid system?	Wh-Question
meeting time rescheduling.	About-task
to have more or less uh silence portions inserted.	Statement
the first thing is what's you know showing on t v.	Statement
i mean they they were people who didn't have accounts at icsi.	Defending/Explanation

when is the evaluation?	Wh-Question
uh you're going to be gone for the next three weeks or something?	Understanding Check
yeah it's the same.	Statement
i mean if you re ran the recognition then you just run it	Understanding Check
not very quickly.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well and then you have the gender detection.	Statement
so training is done on different conditions and different microphones.	Floor Holder
so we're going to end up with these same kind of sheets that have the the percentages and so on just for the	Floor Holder
yeah is uh it right.	Accept
i think that for the recognizer for the meeting recorder that it's better that i don't speak.	Offer
oh do i have it here?	Self-talk
you couldn't you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things?	Understanding Check
because when i was looking at it we seemed to have lots of stuff going on when no one's saying anything.	Defending/Explanation
in a sort of	Statement
nobody reported it?	Understanding Check

we have absolutely no means of enforcing that.	Statement
the training and testing.	Collaborative Completion
you should do both.	Mimic Other

that that you know that would help in terms of encoding of overlaps.	Rising Tone
the edge.	Dispreferred Answers
the other thing you can do	Offer
well but that's not	Floor Grabber
so that's maybe a problem with what i was just saying.	Statement
and then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition would be interesting to do.	Offer
okay turn the mikes off and let's talk.	Action-directive
so these sort of calibration issues.	Statement
uh transcript tied to a single channel uh audio.	Statement
so if we used another method to get the first pass i think it would probably work.	Offer
but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and um someone not talking.	Downplayer
you first look at the lowball ones.	Understanding Check
to the wrong we should just explain what it what it means here and that it's a common term.	Offer

only one of those things are going to be lit up when we pass this on.	Rising Tone
in other words we're we're not going to attempt to build uh it do the real work of building a portable device that's little that is doing all the computation we want to do for the recognition and the far field mike uh compensation and all that stuff.	Statement

yeah that's doesn't make it a great term.	Acknowledge-answer
uh actually i was talking to dick karp about it a little bit.	Floor Holder
an arithmetic average or a geometric average?	Declarative-Question
um and you know then with the time marks you can do an automatic comparison of your of your forced alignments.	Floor Holder
so i take it that was similar to the what what we did for the parsing.	Understanding Check
and there were a hundred and twenty three	Understanding Check
it it i it's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
obviously just a simple number absolute number isn't going to work.	Statement
sit here.	Action-directive
um now one of the things that's nice about what we did is we do have a a uh a filtering which leads to a a uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum which allows us to downsample.	Floor Holder
right and that that included a fair amount of fiddling around since it's it's more or less the first time we've tried to do it.	Accept
oh well not not look.	Acknowledge-answer
well is it?	Tag-Question
right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here.	Floor Grabber
so you have to	Action-directive
and uh i'd almost argue for weighting that highest.	Floor Holder
oh i see the see uh specifically in our situation d and o are going to be uh	Acknowledge-answer
well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area.	Negative Non-no Answers

which is probably true.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well of course it was a bug.	Statement
uh leave it on.	Action-directive
i didn't think so either.	Accept
guaranteed.	Expansions of y/n Answers
a simultaneous digit okay.	Acknowledge-answer
it does it automatically actually.	Expansions of y/n Answers
assuming she's coming to this meeting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so what happened to is it possible at all to display the words in their aligned locations?	Floor Grabber
huh cool.	Assessment/Appreciation
and um how how where is the end?	Rhetorical-Question
or cantonese as the case may be.	Expansions of y/n Answers
situational context?	Understanding Check
twenty?	Understanding Check
for whatever that's	Statement
let's assume this is the output.	Action-directive
it will tell you	Statement
wait this is on on sunday?	Declarative-Question
yes i mean	Accept
but you wouldn't tell you which ones were wrong.	Defending/Explanation
and but it runs much much faster.	Statement
yes except that the command has to not take a password.	Accept
um and then it's a pretty small neural network which use um nine frames of of six features from c. zero to c. fives plus the first derivatives.	Floor Holder
uh that i agree.	Accept
and it's used before the delta computation.	Statement
so maybe there is a way in c v s to effectively lock something if you don't want people to make any changes?	Understanding Check
that's your indicator there and twenty three that somebody happens to say in a meeting.	Statement
that will be really interesting to see.	Assessment/Appreciation
where instead of using the current frame it uses adjacent frames also in designing the wiener filter.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's actually set to zero?	Understanding Check
you you mean for noise cancelling or	Understanding Check
definition.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote.	Statement
and it looks and so i looked at all of the utterances from you chuck in that one conversation.	Statement
when are his prelims?	Rising Tone
and then the person is presented with what's running on t v.	Rising Tone
it may be that they're making them better in some ways and worse in others.	Defending/Explanation
it's number three it says but we'll be able to figure it out.	Statement
yeah because some of our non natives are pretty non native.	Floor Grabber
to de correlate it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the buying snack schema.	Rising Tone
forty.	Self-talk
okay great!	Acknowledge-answer
just like you picked some version of h t k and made that the baseline.	Statement
again	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
uh it's been a while.	Floor Holder
the whatever you uh tested with recently right?	Understanding Check
and sometimes it's not.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i appreciate that.	Thanking
you're just going to have to explain it to me then on tuesday.	Action-directive
what we want to do with that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
okay we we're going to bleep that out.	Acknowledge-answer
the uh the in terms of why is it's laid out like this versus some other	Statement
okay so now once you get that that one then you then you do a or second order or something taylor series expansion of this.	Acknowledge-answer
the way we absolutely have those means that are even part of the m three l a a p i.	Rising Tone
your quals and your triple a i.	Rising Tone
yeah so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief net.	Accept
uh not last i tried.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
i actually don't see how you get that.	Other Answers
well it's too clean.	Statement
um that's actually a little tricky in english.	Assessment/Appreciation
let's just assume our bayes net just has three decision nodes for the time being.	Action-directive
got it all right.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah like the entropy of the the output.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the v a d then that's so be it.	Statement
so i mean there's other	Statement
and we are currently testing with putting the neural network in the k l t.	Rising Tone
and you guys will argue some more?	Declarative-Question
so looking at the data where you know what's the what's what's what's characteristic.	Floor Holder
and um andreas and i talked about it.	Floor Holder
yeah i'll i'll i'll write him an	Accept
i i don't know the answer to that.	Other Answers
they both	Statement
yeah otherwise it'd be a good idea.	Accept
so not everybody will be reading digits.	Statement
did you solve speech recognition last week?	Humorous Material
uh it's really useful	Assessment/Appreciation
why why	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
like i said i'm sure i'm just hitting everything with a hammer that i developed.	Downplayer
when i added the the neural network it doubles the number of deletions.	Statement
there's a clicks?	Rising Tone
uh the compensation of the dictionary one time.	Floor Holder
with timit okay.	Acknowledge-answer
a bug is what i mean.	Statement
if this component were perfect.	Expansions of y/n Answers
under so under action schema there's a list that can include both both things.	Understanding Check
i mean we weren't talking over a telephone here.	Defending/Explanation
or having is also um associated with location.	Floor Grabber
but the it's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box.	Statement
so the enter view approach the the the eva um those are fixed slots in this particular action.	Statement
but yeah if you take	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i think they would.	Accept
yeah is film the trajector?	Acknowledge-answer
and then we can sort of this instructor can say well uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here.	Statement
and when	Floor Holder
okay i understand now.	Statement
yeah we we've tried including the full full bank.	Acknowledge-answer
well i mean you yeah of course you're you're also	Statement
uh it's just a single uh you know a single phone in the pronunciation.	Floor Holder
certainly you can get some	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
just so that	Understanding Check
so we should try to do it internally.	Offer
so i won't be here for	Topic Change
i can't i'm having competing microphone headphone problems here.	Statement
i had mentioned this a couple times before the the commercial devices that do uh uh voice uh you know active miking.	Statement
and we wanted to use that uh kind of analysis.	Statement
because um the noises are from the t.i. digits right?	Defending/Explanation
uh this is slightly off topic.	Topic Change
less memory.	Statement
this is another linear relation that this to develop this in vectors taylor series.	Statement
that that's a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
the filter.	Expansions of y/n Answers
once you get a real recognizer at the back end.	Statement
how many mikes are we recording right now?	Rising Tone
this bud's for	Self-talk
so where are we?	About-task
which is that the constructions that uh nancy and keith and friends are doing uh are in a way quite general.	Assessment/Appreciation
and um this is not too complicated.	Floor Holder
m s g yeah.	Collaborative Completion
do the simplest thing first.	Offer
i always write down the wrong things.	3rd-party-talk
and then at the end about our bayes net.	Statement
does s t m do it per word or per utterance?	Yes-No-question
oh i guess it's the same sheets.	Understanding Check
they've got headphones.	Statement
which is um m f c c.	Expansions of y/n Answers
go there and not go there.	Rising Tone
aurora.	Statement
uh if we use the the old l d a filter i mean the l d a filter that was in the proposal we have like eighty two point seven percent recognition rate.	Statement
but um that's not as frequent as just laughing between speaking.	Floor Holder
you're you're you can assume similar distributions.	Statement
hand checked?	Understanding Check
wait so you're saying next tuesday is it the whole group meeting?	Understanding Check
so if these are two different channels and somebody's talking here and somebody else is talking here just that word.	Statement
and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me.	Floor Grabber
then it then it falls back this way so it's	Statement
so so what they were saying it's one of these things is you know all you need is more data sort of.	Floor Holder
yeah that's that's the dummy dummy p d a.	Statement
yeah so perhaps we could have a a large gain uh just by looking at improving the uh recognition not of phonemes but of phoneme classes simply.	Floor Grabber
yeah no but run into does.	Acknowledge-answer
well they're very	Statement
but i mean just in general adding information	Statement
those are interesting examples.	Assessment/Appreciation
so so this is the the other approach which is what do we do in the future to try to make this less common?	Rhetorical-Question
every construction.	Misspeak Self-Correction
that was interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
i didn't just say that no.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah i think it's it's five frames.	Acknowledge-answer
it's the last week of april until the fourth of may.	Statement
like are we adapting to it?	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i think the the whole reason for having as long as we have which was like a week and a half is is because of bugs like that.	Statement
am i sure about what?	Yes-No-question
okay that is a bit more than i thought.	Self-talk
from the re synthesis.	Collaborative Completion
that's the one that's painful that hurts it hurts so bad.	Defending/Explanation
as of what point?	Understanding Check
i mean the only advantage to using the longer threshold would be that you run less risk of missing some some speech.	Understanding Check
so it's forty five.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because we're still testing.	Defending/Explanation
that's very good.	Assessment/Appreciation
well we should we we should work on compressing the heads and	Offer
and i fix this for all the all the sentences.	Statement
well they wouldn't look at it at this point.	Dispreferred Answers
and cameras.	Statement
right because you haven't done any training.	Floor Grabber
if you are wearing this over your ears and you've got it all the way out here.	Rising Tone
i'm i'm confused.	Defending/Explanation
so you have a good set of features that everybody's worked really hard to make.	Defending/Explanation
develop.	Rising Tone
you have to be willing to jump to something that's quite different.	Statement
the other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back.	Humorous Material
and this was one of them that was kind of funny.	Statement
so like this is from a stop to to a a vocalic.	Expansions of y/n Answers
presumably to handle some um inertia in the in the production system.	Defending/Explanation
bread rolls?	Understanding Check
yeah it's the crown.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um i it was	Floor Grabber
could we capture that?	Rising Tone
i sent you know that one?	Rising Tone
so you could've had a repeat count in there or something.	Understanding Check
um just as an example for you know the future of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphones.	Floor Grabber
because well we tried several thing.	Defending/Explanation
but can come up with their with their own	Statement
i thought he i thought he said in that mail that he would need to take it down another time.	Statement
i mean can we keep the microphones and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head?	Rising Tone
not witch like.	Statement
and that cuts down the time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean i might even mention that this work you're doing is sort of also with the m p i in leipzig.	Maybe
so when you whiten it then it's like you the the only noise to to first order the only noise that you have is white noise.	Floor Holder
especially because of the the strange c c one shape.	Defending/Explanation
i i thought was like three two two five.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
right quicknet is a very nice stream based library.	Floor Grabber
so there are there was like some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when i try different thresholds.	Statement
uh let's see this is the sixteenth?	Floor Holder
and and and then i guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you're feeding into the v.a.d. and feeding it into the other one as well.	Offer
i mean like if we were to choose i don't know if i were to choose between one or the other i'd rather have it played.	Offer
so this is a two dimensional tile.	Repeat
well no we can store them here.	Reject
you could put them at the back of the queue or something.	Offer
and then if we find any problems have the transcribers listen and	Offer
if we can't then we can fake it even if we're we report you know we're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time.	Rising Tone
uh that was the second thing.	Acknowledge-answer
if you are using	Statement
well but it was an m s g like thing but it wasn't m s g.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
the crown of pain.	Humorous Material
yeah just doing a digits on it uh connected digits.	Floor Grabber
so for example if we alternated between two beeps a high and a low.	Statement
or we can do it.	Offer
no no!	Reject
how do we make the decision on as to which one to listen to?	Rising Tone
so we have uh believe it or not we have all the bottom ones here.	Rising Tone
oh was it trimodal ? okay.	Rhetorical-question Continue
how what's happening there.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right so this would work well for uh pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that.	Floor Grabber
so you have constraints that are dependent on the actual specific filler uh of some attribute.	Understanding Check
so they'll be given this map which means that they won't have to like ask the system for for like high level information about where things are?	Understanding Check
i have not the slightest idea.	Other Answers
which is like the number of m f c c that we keep and other small things.	Expansions of y/n Answers
how many how many institutes can you say do that?	Wh-Question
but the first um word of what he says often i.	Statement
demo.	Collaborative Completion
but it's kind of painful for because basically if we put them on c ds then each c d will have all the channels for one recording.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh car i think.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that i mean that the top one does not imply the second one.	Defending/Explanation
i yeah i don't want it on.	3rd-party-talk
wasn't there some experiment you were going to try?	Rising Tone
about other experiments?	Declarative-Question
you know casual users who are just browsing can just get it read only.	Offer
and we don't really know	Other Answers
are too close.	Collaborative Completion
how do we how do we specify which ones are on?	Wh-Question
okay so this is february second uh two thousand.	Statement
and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour if you used all if you used all	Understanding Check
which use a new filter that's much shorter.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the other thing is that you actually have direction here.	Statement
but i mean yes.	Statement
but i think it's close.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah i think there are probably ways that you can say that you know only certain users are allowed to change things.	Floor Grabber
not v a d.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so is the right now are the ideas the rich rich the r a d or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention.	Understanding Check
how many how many beeps are there and how many do were they were were off?	Wh-Question
this is the difference.	Acknowledge-answer
one with i think twenty four channels and one with sixty four channels.	Expansions of y/n Answers
m one hundred.	3rd-party-talk
and also i've been talking to um andreas and thilo about the um smartkom language model.	Statement
future activities something?	Understanding Check
that headphone the headphone that you have to put on backwards with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it.	Rising Tone
speech nonspeech?	Understanding Check
well what i did is is to take um to measure the average	Statement
and it would it seems like it would help them.	Defending/Explanation
less robust.	Mimic Other
every meeting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you saw that?	Rising Tone
uh or the sub actions category.	Offer
and it worked pretty well.	Expansions of y/n Answers
just write it down.	Action-directive
is it on?	Rising Tone
how long did it take you to set this up?	Wh-Question
what does this tell us?	Wh-Question
so the basic requirement fulfilled.	Understanding Check
there're separate ribbons.	Acknowledge-answer
not thirteen.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah so it's different.	Acknowledge-answer
and it loads faster certainly.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but the principal distinction between having the the pure schema and their instantiations on the one hand and adding some whatever more intention oriented specification um on parallel to that that this approach seems to be uh workable to me.	Assessment/Appreciation
so we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments.	Reformulate/Summarize
uh i mean you'd have to do the nonlinearity part and deal with that.	Statement
well you know the the thing is that if you look at the numbers on the on the more difficult cases um if you really believe that was going to be the predominant use none of this would be good enough.	Negative Non-no Answers
those transcriptionists need to know their place.	Repeat
uh they were doing this it wasn't word sense disambiguation it was	Floor Holder
like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this.	Offer
right so we need to run thilo's thing on it.	Floor Holder
the the ear thing comes out to here.	Expansions of y/n Answers
to to to generate that it's it has to distinguish between.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but uh the way the mean is adapted um it's signal dependent.	Floor Holder
i don't know how much you'd be training on.	Statement
we this doesn't concern you anymore robert.	Defending/Explanation
well let's why don't we talk about microphone issues?	Offer
sixty four?	Understanding Check
i'm sorry yeah.	Apology
i'm mostly looking at child language which you know will have some overlap but not total with the kinds of things that you guys are getting.	Statement
now they're they're not being awfully precise.	Statement
i'm sorry for interrupting.	Apology
or three days.	Misspeak Self-Correction
you know what's going on?	Declarative-Question
completely irrelevant.	Expansions of y/n Answers
also uh i mean there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data.	Floor Grabber
and then feed it to h.m.m.	Defending/Explanation
i haven't thought it through.	Statement
would you really say that?	Maybe
so if you add these components it goes to a hundred and seventy.	Statement
so we have to come up with values for this and this this this and so forth.	Action-directive
um anything to add?	Open-Question
are are are we done with uh m r business?	Rising Tone
and so it just was not doable with the current interface.	Statement
but they are channelized ones though?	Understanding Check
um we're	Statement
uh okay yeah so the only	Acknowledge-answer
is it due to the fact that um the probability of the silence at the output of the network is	Yes-No-question
it's pretty simple.	Statement
because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better.	Defending/Explanation
and he was the first first stuff he did was transcribing chuck.	Rising Tone
or in this action schema	Misspeak Self-Correction
what's september sixth?	Rising Tone
so speaking of linux so there's some impetus at um s r i to actually uh build support linux as a platform.	Floor Grabber
this this one is has a couple of cheezy electrettes and	Understanding Check
how should that be done?	Wh-Question
what what is why do you need the um the forced alignment for the h l t i mean for the eurospeech paper?	Rising Tone
well two to the power of the number of neurons.	Accept-part
i think i think the the meeting is on the thirteenth or something.	Maybe
because you could then really localize where the error is.	Defending/Explanation
so is	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
is this just this little	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so this would be sixty two?	Understanding Check
yeah and i i think that they're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals.	Statement
because uh i have the results uh of the study of different energy without the law length.	Rising Tone
oh yeah i wasn't necessarily saying it should be better.	Acknowledge-answer
oh i you want audio?	Understanding Check
well well you know it might be something we'd want to do with some uh small subset of the whole thing.	Offer
was the threshold uh how far down?	Rising Tone
it's real noise condition.	Statement
but is it better than nothing?	Rising Tone
so actually i'm not sure	Statement
is due to some inherent limitation to the method for these tasks?	Yes-No-question
and then it's then it's then it's the transcribers tightening stuff up.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so you have uh you have uh nonspeech single person speech and multiple person speech?	Declarative-Question
but the but um the other thing	Statement
and uh i guess the main topic will be uh you telling us what happened.	Floor Holder
so i think he	Statement
oh okay sorry.	Acknowledge-answer
but it's it's easy to make up plausible ones.	Dispreferred Answers
but we can f t p stuff over.	Understanding Check
because it has um this sixty four hertz cut off.	Defending/Explanation
so it should	Statement
and did you uh forward morgan brian's thing?	Rising Tone
a new transcript.	Collaborative Completion
oh they didn't.	Acknowledge-answer
is there more to be said?	Open-Question
like the english language sentence of it is these are the you know the following films are being shown or something like that.	Understanding Check
do you want to say something about the parameters that you change?	Rising Tone
it's i i understand.	Acknowledge-answer
because you have to uh maneuver around on the on both windows then.	Defending/Explanation
phoneme.	Collaborative Completion
i mean maybe the where is something question as a whole you know can be construed as locational versus instructional request.	Maybe
i'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things.	Defending/Explanation
maybe that's hopeless anyway.	Maybe
just in the spatial domain are rare.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean when when when you use a product like dragon dictate they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on.	Statement
it's good to have some uh cases of the same utterance at different different times.	Defending/Explanation
i've been eating a lot.	Humorous Material
this week?	Declarative-Question
and with this you can specify the what's happening in the situation and what's happening with the user.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but but i'm just i'm just saying that if you were to compare that with running that on the new data that it would be an a more optimistic outcome.	Defending/Explanation
high correlation.	Collaborative Completion
so this just adds one.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
for every question?	Declarative-Question
or was it sunil?	Or-Clause
so what i need to do is make it so that the the quicknet stuff can read those.	Statement
so i mean that would be a fine use for for that machine.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah i'll	Accept
are not.	Collaborative Completion
okay that's that's a good point.	Acknowledge-answer
it just some user like meeting root or something.	Offer
because we are dropping it at the back end after everything all the features are computed.	Defending/Explanation
was were there folks from b b n presenting?	Rising Tone
were you using the the normalization in addition to this?	Rising Tone
so if if raw speed is the problem this thing is written in tcl.	Floor Grabber
i'm sure it's something wrong with my head.	Downplayer
i mean the aurora.	Misspeak Self-Correction
and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that.	Rising Tone
you know like do you say all right i'm going to uh do an s p g action?	Yes-No-question
so five frames that's twenty.	Statement
yep yep yep.	Accept
yeah yeah that's true.	Accept
so so if you get one	Statement
i hadn't even thought about that although it'd be kind of interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
you have several some unvoiced?	Rising Tone
then you have the l.d.a.	Statement
i mean we might be able at the very worst we can get transcribers to correct the cases where	Offer
oh yeah you're right yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah hopefully i think what we want to have is to put these features in some kind of	Acknowledge-answer
yeah both channels.	Collaborative Completion
where were they when we needed them?	Humorous Material
but each one of the mixture components	Statement
with uh manolo pardo and javier uh ferreiros who was here before.	Expansions of y/n Answers
instead of just on the	Expansions of y/n Answers

so one thing is that you'd have to do i think	Offer
well they are trained on the same data as the final h.m.m. are.	Statement
oh yeah that's really hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
so we have we have one point for one energy for each filter bank.	Rising Tone
because that's part of what you're learning in it.	Defending/Explanation
right now nobody would be there.	Mimic Other
uh maybe i'd	Statement
i don't get it.	Statement
and those show up on the mixed signal?	Understanding Check
well not the ones that	Dispreferred Answers
where is the castle?	Wh-Question
yeah i didn't think so.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh well this doesn't help neither.	Floor Holder
because what does that tell us?	Rhetorical-Question
lee you liked that	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
subway right?	Expansions of y/n Answers
some silly stuff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because you've optimized the other system.	Defending/Explanation
and it it was okay.	Statement
and we have all the top ones.	Statement
it's something that's also short enough in in latency.	Statement
and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth.	Offer
so it's done it's done new for each new utterance.	Understanding Check
and and uh in fact since the others are somewhat better	Floor Holder
on the highly mismatch.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i worry about you.	Humorous Material
because you can have multiple channels.	Defending/Explanation
yeah we should do this the upcoming days.	Accept
because you're like it's a state of there's resource.	Defending/Explanation
seventeenth?	Declarative-Question
uh and there's also the uh uh air conditioning.	Floor Holder
well andreas how well did it work on the non lapel stuff?	Rising Tone
that we've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to i b m and have them try it out.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but i didn't want to i i didn't want to get into it because uh you know it was the application was one i didn't know anything about.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah the numbers are a good idea.	Floor Grabber
it's it's certainly related.	Statement
yeah then we just map it to a reject model.	Floor Grabber
and that and what they're doing is in both cases just saying curly brackets laughing after the unit.	Statement
i systematically add the noise.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah over the corner of the ear.	Acknowledge-answer
well the first thing maybe is that the eurospeech paper is uh accepted.	Rising Tone
like during fricatives or during speech pauses.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so that's after you explore these other alternatives that might be another way to start looking is is just improving the training set.	Offer
but then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation.	Statement
as if i understand it correctly it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes.	Defending/Explanation
um pfff	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
because we're going to want to know that anyway.	Defending/Explanation
guess we're done.	Topic Change
right so so you'll have to i	Floor Grabber
and i imagine they still plan to.	Statement

the non pathological native speakers.	Expansions of y/n Answers
twenty ninth.	Statement
x times one plus uh n uh n n n minus x?	Understanding Check
so this is just again an x m l schemata which defines a set of possible uh permissible x m l structures.	Rising Tone

so it was to get it was to get more data and better to to squeeze the boundaries in.	Understanding Check
maybe even not.	Maybe
oh you totally unadapted.	Acknowledge-answer
but it's this.	Dispreferred Answers

would you would you want to do this kind of uh difference thing after you do spectral subtraction?	Rising Tone
uh i've been trying different slightly slightly different approaches.	Floor Holder
that's a little bit of stuff to do.	Statement

what kind of uh front end processing did you do?	Wh-Question
i mean i i think one thing that's probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where you know we can say that for sure there's no problems with any of the transcripts.	Defending/Explanation
in terms of it being windows versus	Statement
so why don't we just around and people can give updates.	Action-directive
are we?	Yes-No-question
so uh sunil will be in oregon.	Floor Holder
so um you had like an action schema and a source path goal schema.	Floor Grabber
because you also see the breaths on the waveform.	Defending/Explanation
because even in people like they don't know what you're talking about if you're using some sort of strange construction.	Defending/Explanation
so you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose it doesn't the wind doesn't hit the mike.	Statement
and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad.	Rising Tone
are we going to do one at a time or should we read them all at once again?	Or-Question

who who are we buying these from?	Rising Tone
i i um	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

how much space is that using up?	Wh-Question
when are you two getting back?	Rising Tone
the sentence ordering one was that barselou and these guys?	Rising Tone
there isn't any k.l.t. or anything?	Declarative-Question
yes we could we could try	Statement
it's not pejorative at all.	Assessment/Appreciation

i mean it's it's it's always the same thing.	Statement
and just as long as we have a little warning.	Collaborative Completion
so we have to make it convenient for them to make changes that they want to make.	Offer
it's not a simple not a simple problem.	Statement
fff!	Exclamation
um anybody has anybody you guys or or naren uh somebody tried the uh um second second stream thing?	Floor Grabber
yeah and i don't need to be here particularly deeply.	Accept
i'm just worried about letting everybody go in and make changes.	Statement
and then so the only reason way we would know what question he's asking is based upon	Understanding Check
um however we just have one result.	Floor Holder
so probably it it would do that.	Self-talk
oh you mean just break the one hour into a few chunks.	Acknowledge-answer
well yeah but in the uh let's just deal with the the simple case of we're not worrying about timing or anything.	Dispreferred Answers
which you know i i we were aware of.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um and this uh action two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do.	Floor Holder
yeah so is it because with any luck there'll actually be a a there'll be collections at columbia.	Rising Tone
it was really hot.	Statement
but it was robustness rather than e d u so i guess depends on whether we're willing to use robustness.	Statement
or the worst case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons.	Misspeak Self-Correction
and when we put the the them v a d the result is better.	Floor Holder
which is with respect to um this thing that you've been working on for the recording monitoring script.	Rising Tone
let's assume this is our our question.	Action-directive
yeah i didn't intend to say that every possible	Statement
yes but if you do that then someone who isn't the owner can't unchange it.	Accept
and one a guy from s r i who was at one of the s r i meetings.	Defending/Explanation
i mean there is interesting stuff in terms of how language works.	Assessment/Appreciation
because you have scores for that for the other case.	Defending/Explanation
well we could just	Dispreferred Answers
okay that makes a lot more sense to me now.	Floor Holder
you want to talk about recognition?	Declarative-Question
because they're too big.	Defending/Explanation
one minus epsilon.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what's wrong with	3rd-party-talk
if the speech-nonspeech were perfect to begin with the detector that would already be an improvement.	Statement
but not to modify them.	Understanding Check
anyway it's just an idea.	Downplayer
but after the meeting's done would they want to?	Defending/Explanation
all we mean by that is that we're giving the recognizer more information than it would have if you were running it raw.	Downplayer
yeah if you don't have one more than one mike you don't have a very good handle on location.	Floor Grabber
i mean that's that's that's a fairly strong indication of dislike.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then and then later we can uh replace it with	Offer
yeah we we can try and look at that together.	Offer
comments on that?	Open-Question
what i was going to say is that um maybe maybe with the noise removal uh these things are now more correlated.	Maybe
what if i were what if i were to call you eva?	Open-Question
currently.	Accept-part
so we'll perhaps try to convince o g i people to use the new the new filters.	Commit
and um they they differed in some respects.	Floor Holder
this is what uh	Statement
same thing?	Understanding Check
yeah and and tell her you know tell her your specific problem.	Floor Holder
it it doubles.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um you know this of course does not make sense in light of the statue of liberty.	Floor Holder
those are the bottom things are inputs also.	Defending/Explanation
even we don't do anything else doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster.	Statement
because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch as it was the case for the.	Defending/Explanation
good good good.	Continuer
so you you end up with a vector that's the same length as the f f t vector.	Understanding Check
you don't have to use the acronym.	Offer
did you just did you just stick the the the the microphone actually in the tea?	Rising Tone
it's not part of a v a d system that you're doing?	Rising Tone
that's all i have for today.	About-task
what is the first variable in that probability?	Rising Tone
this not.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah but but there's there's really not much difference between the one second and the two second.	Floor Grabber
and and have a beep model.	Statement
hhh	Floor Holder
because you can automatically pretty much merge things if you've only got twenty words or so in an utterance.	Defending/Explanation
one was rehearse your talk	Statement
i can't put this over my ear.	Statement
yeah sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together.	Floor Grabber
well you can do you can you you can do certain normalizations like you know gain control	Statement
uh a link between the action schema a field in the in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use.	Floor Holder
one plus n by x.	Self-talk
because it seems like just adding information shouldn't give worse results.	Defending/Explanation
we also still have to make a decision about mike issues.	About-task
no but that would be a good idea.	Reject
and that actually shouldn't be too slow.	Assessment/Appreciation
and you know with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit.	Statement
when you when you say the input to the java bayes it takes a certain format.	Statement
so if you we really just construe it as a	Offer
and get stuff out of it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
mark very audible breaths and laughter especially.	Offer
or how do they work in terms of other things?	Rhetorical-Question
yep it just just hangs down there.	Floor Grabber
and uh you know creating a second database.	Statement
advertise in their classes as well.	Collaborative Completion
and then they had this log scale showing a	Statement
can i have something to write on the back of?	Rising Tone
oh you've got the parser done.	Statement
what are we why are we writing it down?	Rising Tone
um i can say about just just quickly to get through it that dave and i submitted this a.s.r.u.	Floor Holder
uh i i have to look to see what the exact numbers were.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
high cost frequency.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then do the	Statement
the initial codebook.	Misspeak Self-Correction
i mean on the the you're that's see that's you.	Statement
um yeah but there's like a certain level of	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
i had i i had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work and i do nothing.	Humorous Material
but still that's that's a pretty big uh win.	Assessment/Appreciation
they would just listen.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right the only problem with that is if anything goes wrong or if you want to switch from one thing to another.	Floor Grabber
so i decided that i i'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows.	Commit
so it looks like	Statement
which which one is closer to what the proposal was that was submitted to aurora?	Wh-Question
and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around.	Statement
he slipped on the wet floor.	Statement
now the the reason for for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back.	Statement
i'm open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful.	Statement
okay so anyway i looked at everybody else's	Acknowledge-answer
because i i thought that it was it's interesting to look at what features are useful.	Defending/Explanation
yes in a sense that's exactly the the the idea.	Accept
oh so it's sort of automatic derived from the structure that that is built elsewhere.	Acknowledge-answer
so if i excluded the pathological ones by definition those that had like over ninety five percent error rate and the non natives then the average error rate was like one point four or something.	Floor Grabber
on the in the in the first iteration a stupid list of source path goal actions.	Statement
so is it is it though the performance big relation in the high high mismatch has something to do with the uh cleaning up that you that is done on the timit after adding noise?	Rising Tone
not have it	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
they could choose any signal to look at.	Statement
so he said tell me something about the history of that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh how about you carmen?	Topic Change
uh um uh	Floor Holder
so it's at friday at three?	Understanding Check
the students.	Statement
and so there may be	Statement
it looks like the uh metaphor didn't get in yet.	Statement
uh i won't.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so i can show you what i've got get your input on it and maybe some suggestions.	Offer
for a couple of reasons.	Defending/Explanation
collections at at u w.	Rising Tone
did the one you sent on the email have the	Yes-No-question
i wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was.	About-task
do they mean omnidirectional?	Understanding Check
you do need to know i mean to have that kind of information.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
right well what i was thinking is map all the speech to the reject model.	Floor Grabber
uh so maybe we we can take a look at that.	Floor Holder
with the representations of parameter.	Repeat
i don't not necessarily i would think.	Dispreferred Answers
um oh and also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker forms.	Floor Grabber
so this is uh basically this is comparing an original version of the signal to a smoothed version of the same signal?	Understanding Check
you would send i mean uh a transcriber is used i mean i don't know assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting.	Statement
and then i went through afterwards and double checked it.	Statement
so i i i think it would be better to have to have more of them concatenated together in order to have better language model.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's on biocomputation would	Statement
i couldn't get the words and the waveform at the same time for some reason.	Statement
so the first thing is the automatic thing.	Understanding Check
just think of it as as wheel in german.	Offer
then i suggest we move on to the to	About-task
seems like you'd want to do it on the f f t bins.	Offer
yeah actually that's true.	Accept
but if the noise is different it goes somewhere else.	Expansions of y/n Answers
could.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um it's probably a good time to look at what's really going on and seeing if there's a there's a way to combine the best ideas.	Floor Holder
but you're	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah even for a well matched case it's sixty percent error rate reduction.	Acknowledge-answer
it could it could there could be some missing ones.	Offer
if they do something on a computer in a format we can handle we could give them a text file that was a template with speaker i d and beeps already in it.	Statement
key file's different.	Defending/Explanation
how about during the picnic?	Offer
yeah we like high error rates.	Humorous Material
if they heard it over again they would know it would be obvious from their transcript whether they did that one or not.	Statement
and you can also see in the waveform	Statement
do you think that's something i should just send to him?	Rising Tone
and the notion is if you have the full spectrum with all the little nitty gritty details that that has the effect of both.	Statement
no and i don't need to meet with those people.	Dispreferred Answers
mainly because of the sixty four hertz and the good v a d.	Defending/Explanation
you've you haven't seen any final results for that.	Statement
so it's pretty much the same problem.	Statement
right because they're they're presumably going to start recording next month.	Floor Grabber
well first of all we haven't decided whether we're meeting recorder data issues or recognition this week.	About-task
so where where does how do you wear that?	Wh-Question
yeah or you can run into an old friend or run.	Floor Grabber
and then the question is what is what does it look like?	Rhetorical-Question
oh we should definitely get with them then.	Floor Grabber
yeah i mean basically it's just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it.	Floor Holder
in in the one you pointed at.	Expansions of y/n Answers
how do we decide how to answer it?	Wh-Question
so this one is a longer uh	Understanding Check
namely with you or something.	Statement
i i think it only took something like uh three or four hours to do the full training.	Statement
but i could be wrong.	Downplayer
so you want a more exotic one version of that.	Offer
and uh he did not say look at points where you were changing broad uh phonetic class for instance.	Floor Holder
so so like yours is pretty far down below your mouth yeah.	Floor Holder
and is that and that's changeable?	Understanding Check
what is v t s?	Humorous Material
but anyway so there are there are cases like that.	Statement
oh i'm	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
is is is this a	Yes-No-question
and i mean and the whole point of it was not that it was good to increase your error rate but it was good to be willing to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky things and trying because there's this notion of a local minimum that if you just have some system that's very complex	Statement
right i'm well	Accept
he only train	Statement
or saturday?	Or-Clause
and also uh i think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task.	Offer
what actually is happening there today?	Rising Tone
show us the way bhaskara.	Action-directive
is it part of the non speech?	Yes-No-question
well the v.a.	Statement
and it will still do the right thing.	Statement
are we to just to make sure i know what's going on we're talking about robert's thesis proposal today?	Understanding Check
no no no but wait maybe maybe what we have instead of a beep is a uh synthesized number.	Offer
or or not constant but but uh varying over time in fact is another way to go.	Offer
yeah now you get to tell us what's the interesting part.	Accept
which means you know even just splitting it up into a few files would probably take you know nearly all the time.	Statement
and it's possible that nancy will be here.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we can end the meeting.	Action-directive
you can speak into it and ask for t v and movie information.	Offer
was not um	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
well we don't know what's it's going to be the t.i. digits yet.	Other Answers
oh it's a treat.	Assessment/Appreciation
so we can do some more recordings but there's there's a little little bit of ramp up on that over the next month say.	Statement
okay this i can i can get it in here.	Statement
right currently.	Accept
well that's actually what i had planned personally.	Humorous Material
another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you're missing that could help?	Wh-Question
or you just make a a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those.	Offer
so you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is.	Defending/Explanation
instruction.	Statement
so let me try to understand.	Action-directive
no no no uh we have not we have not seen the light.	Reject
right what would this be like if it were perfect?	Floor Grabber
and i don't know maybe a constant noise addition would would be fine also.	Offer
yeah i'm sure he'd love to	Floor Grabber
but it's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information.	Defending/Explanation
yeah but i'm not too sure if if we can really represent overlap with with the detector i i i used up to now.	Negative Non-no Answers
five more processors.	Collaborative Completion
because the person	Defending/Explanation
so what was the what was the threshold part of it?	Wh-Question
oh okay so we just have to wander around and collect them up.	Acknowledge-answer
so three is sounds good.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean i'm worried if you can't lock a file this this to me sounds very scary.	Assessment/Appreciation
but i just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong.	Statement
so where it should illustrate	Understanding Check
it's based on the system that has a fifty three point sixty six percent improvement.	Rising Tone
what would you do?	Rising Tone
pop goes the data.	Humorous Material
but i i don't know.	Floor Holder
where was heidelberg um in the thirty years' war?	Rhetorical-Question
i'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for	Statement
sigh.	Assessment/Appreciation
there was a there's actually a word for uh it's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth	Statement
so i got in touch with joe and and uh from your email and things like that.	Floor Holder
and so i'm wondering if we can get a couple of	Offer
actually yeah it's very close to clean speech training because well because the close microphone and noisy speech testing.	Floor Grabber
yeah it's something that that we definitely need to look at with this.	Offer
so it may not	Statement
they haven't	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so i actually went through all of those.	Floor Holder
and see what happens.	Statement
they're very dependent.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and um when we deal with pure reverberation the technique he's using works really really well.	Floor Holder
it's very tedious to check these.	Defending/Explanation
which lets them quickly scan back and forth through the tape.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and and if we and if someone says you know uh something in mandarin to the system wouldn't know which node to look at to answer that question.	Understanding Check
what you might want to do is	Offer
and which also cuts the frequency below sixty four hertz.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those short segments.	Offer

from the while testing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
anything else you want to ask us about?	Open-Question
three weeks?	Declarative-Question
so um i guess i'll just pass it on to dave.	Floor Holder
people.	Humorous Material
we end up with	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i i think it's frequent in in the meeting.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and there is there is also this log energy versus c zero.	Statement
you need to get it wired.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think that would be a good thing to start with.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
couldn't you have a third category?	Rising Tone
yeah and uh	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so they'll have a little bit more natural interaction.	Understanding Check
okay so that's good.	Acknowledge-answer
i mean the only thing i'm worried about with that approach is that if we need to figure out the beep alignment problem before the transcribers do the corrections here then we're in trouble.	Statement
the only argument for doing so would be with reference to the content content maps.	Statement
so i'm going to try.	Floor Holder
we just we save	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
um nevertheless um	Floor Holder
the uh silence sublimination?	Understanding Check
so when you said in town you mean oregon.	Understanding Check
and um there was some confusion as to the consent form which is basically that that what what you just signed.	Floor Holder
so anyway i just reporting that.	Statement
the edge is really uh sixty four?	Declarative-Question
that that was one one one thing.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah i mean i	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i'll probably i might have i'll probably have comments for you separately.	Maybe
um i did some uh uh just a few more experiments before i had to uh go away for the well that week.	Floor Holder
i've had people call me eva.	Statement
actually the left edge of the first filter is at sixty four.	Dispreferred Answers
well or into the cafe for that	Collaborative Completion
right there but there's a shortage of transcription power.	Floor Grabber
do they believe you can get speaker location out of it?	Rising Tone
but they they they come on time to their meetings in order to not be left the last person who has to sit by those mikes.	Defending/Explanation
um you know you have to list exactly what x schema	Floor Holder

yeah he popped in.	Statement

no but this	Reject

and then there was the bump for the non natives and then the pathological ones.	Statement
even if it is fifteen percent worse.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um but the other point to make again is that uh machine learning still does matter.	Floor Holder
and maybe barry barry will be around.	Statement

so that's the point when i'll need to look more carefully at what what what you guys have.	Statement
that would be like that'd be like him.	Assessment/Appreciation
how does it go?	Rising Tone
hidden.	Collaborative Completion
what's the baseline you need to be under?	Rising Tone
um the first thing is trying to play a little bit again with the um time constant.	Floor Holder
so so whether the corrections take too much time.	Floor Holder
when you check something out you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it.	Statement
you mean so actually put put the wavefile in with beep in it.	Understanding Check

i'm not sure if i understand your question.	Downplayer
