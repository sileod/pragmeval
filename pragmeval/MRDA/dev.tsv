so i i need to we need to look at what what the final output is.	Floor Grabber
i see so you want to cheat?	Acknowledge-answer
mccoond.	Rising Tone
yeah we need to put it on a little turntable.	Offer
the the the backchannel will will occur at the end of of those three.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well it will be interesting to find out why they are choosing a higher sampling.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by you know a computer to access information to help along the meeting.	Statement
yeah because sometimes it's not clear.	Floor Holder
because there are like eight people talking to me all at once.	Statement
uh we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were uh completely different.	Floor Holder
and so if you can get uh again my prescription would be that you would with a mixed signal you would take a collection of possible uh features look at them look at how these different classes that you've marked separate themselves and then collect uh in pairs and then collect ten of them or something and then proceed with a bigger classifier.	Offer
so um ohala's going to help do these uh transcriptions of the meeting data?	Declarative-Question
and you're throwing out useless features.	Statement
well there are various things you you have the	Statement
i can't it see i mean can't see it the	Statement
and and put them together.	Offer
we we could we could move us.	Offer
it's it's there's a there's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise.	Defending/Explanation
because i actually	Defending/Explanation
but this is ten frames plus plus	Understanding Check
and it works great.	Statement
i mean so if you wear it sort of around the back it's not too bad.	Assessment/Appreciation
so so uh it doesn't really hurt them to to do that to put in discrimination at that level.	Floor Holder
and you know there's obviously detail behind each of those as much as is needed.	Statement
you could could i just back up a little bit?	Rising Tone
annette's?	Understanding Check
so i don't record anything.	Statement
well i think that we'll bring it back.	Rising Tone
and if you look at	Statement
the s.r.i. recognizer has all this p. make customs stuff built into it.	Statement
um i'm not sure i have the	Floor Holder
unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation.	Statement
since they will still have three.	Statement
see if i can do it just by itself.	Statement
even if they're slightly flawed.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what happened?	Wh-Question
but i think we still have this problem of is it going to be a self evaluation?	Defending/Explanation
uh i'm think about the close caption that you see running by on on live news casts.	Defending/Explanation
and just combining just doing	Statement
does uh this tool you're using is strictly	Yes-No-question
so it's just got a	Statement
pie?	Signal-non-understanding
so she does the adjustments on those guys?	Understanding Check
or if it's then i then i put six or seven or however many it is	Statement
when you end with so.	Statement
but uh which would have been easier for the of course for the machine.	Floor Holder
one of them was to see if that's what they actually said.	Statement
maybe using those as references.	Maybe
so i'm kind of used to that weird sensation having something stuck in my ear.	Defending/Explanation
which is after two stages of wiener filtering.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the the the filtering is done in the frequency domain?	Understanding Check
well you've heard have you heard shoot?	Understanding Check
well that too.	Rising Tone
maybe we can look at it monday.	Offer
but that's just because it's me.	Defending/Explanation
it that's not the case?	Understanding Check
but from this it's pretty safe to say that the system is either two to seven percent away from the performance of a human.	Understanding Check
which is essentially a stretch of speech with uh no pauses exceeding five hundred milliseconds.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah so one	Floor Holder
because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know if you've picked the right set of features.	Defending/Explanation
uh you've heard the crown of pain.	Humorous Material
and do you	Yes-No-question
so i'm going okay.	Statement
but this is very comfortable.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah is	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and time bin corrections and things.	Collaborative Completion
so the interest of this is that as with this technique you can estimate some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal.	Statement
um yeah not better not worse.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
but then keep the speaker names the same as they would be in the old in the close talking uh version.	Offer
subgrouping basically?	Understanding Check
and there's only there's only four slots that are you know in in the first version or the version we're planning to to build.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and then it'll make sure that it never goes above that.	Statement
they could but but uh they	Maybe
not so much no.	Dispreferred Answers
take care of him.	Mimic Other
end point?	Understanding Check
they just work on the code book?	Understanding Check
yeah distributing	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
it's more than a	Assessment/Appreciation
and make one that's	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh it's very common.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but you know how many how many per minute.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah the the pie chart shows actually meetings that are	Floor Grabber
even if it's only slightly worse for well matched.	Expansions of y/n Answers
there was speech.	Reformulate/Summarize
well how people phrase different intentions more or less.	Understanding Check
what i mean is it's not necessarily monetary.	Negative Non-no Answers
but it just seems like it's more prominent than	Negative Non-no Answers
half the data that's been recorded has been transcribed?	Understanding Check
um so if that's your question.	Floor Holder
that's that's my point which which includes both top down and bottom up.	Reformulate/Summarize
duration.	Collaborative Completion
last week i finally got results from the s r i system about this mean subtraction approach.	Statement
that one might be another thing.	Offer
uh i guess.	Maybe
if you if you check it out uh five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so just using the s r i system test it on and test it on aurora t i digits.	Understanding Check
how did i do it?	Understanding Check
we've had some discussion with steve and shawn.	Statement
and i will read these.	Commit
because the only way	Defending/Explanation
and channel one is the distant microphone.	Rising Tone
well that you know that was the concept of having the region thing.	Statement
because if even the smallest organism that's trying to learn to do anything if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penalty for doing anything then it's just going to behave randomly.	Statement
at is that right?	Tag-Question
yeah yeah that's what he was saying before.	Statement
the timing should be	Statement
you know burst.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which you could approximate as two gaussians.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah and we had to split them up.	Accept
maybe after wednesday?	Understanding Check
the ideal sentences where we have complete construction coverage and sort of they match nicely.	Statement
there's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct.	Statement
i mean easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff.	Statement
it it's that paper.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because sometimes it's hard to hear.	Defending/Explanation
i mean i would take maybe twice as long on a a given channel with a speaker who has a german accent than somebody who's you know a native english speaker.	Defending/Explanation
and the transcription conventions	Statement
that one meeting?	Understanding Check
oh now you've touched the fan control.	Statement
um that's from the user model.	Floor Holder
it's it's a side thing.	Defending/Explanation
everything that has situation comes from the situation model a.	Statement
um petra and jan.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is that channel zero information going to be accessible during this test?	Understanding Check
you you should probably talk about that.	Offer
well but i decide kind of how much money uh i'm willing to lose.	Statement
the complete s r i system is one point two.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
the list.	Collaborative Completion
if that's how what you want to do.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i should probably send those to you.	Understanding Check
what's ten point seven?	Wh-Question
okay so we'll definitely go ahead and do that.	Floor Grabber
whereas if we do a service it's going to be limited amount.	Defending/Explanation
well that's fine with me as long as it's just that i didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
can i ask about slurred and angry as inputs to this?	Rising Tone
i've just been using existing digits or broadcast news nets.	Defending/Explanation
and you're saying some of the infrastructure is um the a.t. and. t video conferencing.	Understanding Check
but in	Defending/Explanation
it's but i don't know how high in fact.	Other Answers
and is e d u still recording?	Rising Tone
i think with like some of them like you know with uh the difference between the and the you can you can distinguished very uh definitively like what context they're going to be used in.	Rising Tone
nn huh.	Continuer
and that's also the one that they had already in trying to debug the first stage of this.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we we are meant to be transcribing if they're just left in the the curly brackets?	Understanding Check
as i say we'll just have to listen to it and see how horrible it is.	Offer
how's that working?	Wh-Question
things like just the data format and how we're going to do it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but you may not need a separate room you know.	Reject-part
however um that's you know i do think it's a pretty good indicator.	Accept-part
i mean uh you know they they constantly could've reminding people and going over it.	Defending/Explanation
over the	Statement
and still not reasonable.	Assessment/Appreciation
because i figured there's a limited number.	Defending/Explanation
well the the reason i'm asking is that it's certainly better to get in early with standards and data formats and conventions.	Floor Grabber
out of out of adam's pocket.	Humorous Material
and if you have you know twenty channels and only five speakers then it's	Statement
this is a nist evaluation.	Rising Tone
the segmentations?	Signal-non-understanding
okay so one item for an agenda is uh jane has some uh uh some research to talk about research issues.	About-task
oh yeah also when when they're using this weighting scheme of forty thirty five twenty five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors?	Or-Question
that's a good choice.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean but probably this is designed in such a way that it should be closer.	Defending/Explanation
right yeah i was just saying that it like you know sometimes um if remember i was saying like if there's a discrepancy between fricatives you know like um shuh or suh will show up in a certain part of the spectrum.	Acknowledge-answer
it's just just the word point has	Statement
and uh what the so i'd	Rising Tone
or thh.	Statement
like if you	Defending/Explanation
i do and the reason is because i think that um well having been a grad student as yeah as others here at at berkeley that um i think there's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad in terms of like the status.	Defending/Explanation
okay maybe maybe send me a sentence that's a little thought through about that.	Action-directive
right so so whoever's creating the new models will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously.	Follow Me
okay uh jane since since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours?	Acknowledge-answer
well if you talk less it does in fact use less data.	Statement
it's too hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
hey we could use that in the english	Floor Grabber
well it's some kind of wiener filtering.	Accept-part
how many meetings are we going to record?	Wh-Question
of the board.	Collaborative Completion
you know and then doing the sounds.	Statement
okay endpoint	Topic Change
oh oh oh oh okay.	Acknowledge-answer
that it's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue where we're perfectly willing to give people those boxes.	Defending/Explanation
but it might be important for um	Defending/Explanation
our system we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the p.c.	Reformulate/Summarize
and the idea that we're really after is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics.	Statement
um a student rate shouldn't be very high.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
um pretty well.	Floor Holder
you'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact.	Action-directive
right so the first task is to read some digits.	Floor Grabber
and it would fit right under the right under the the the lip.	Defending/Explanation
did i what?	Signal-non-understanding
so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with?	Declarative-Question
yeah and similarly with digits we now have a lot of digits.	Rising Tone
so we might as well go directly from the natural language grammar.	Floor Holder
someone just needs to sit down and do it who has some time.	Rising Tone
i mean and the joke there was that each of them had specialized in one of them.	Statement
so what about	Wh-Question
i mean it was just a a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps.	Defending/Explanation
i mean he he uh he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust.	Defending/Explanation
that was fun.	Assessment/Appreciation
um sometime i have to talk to some subset of the people in this group at least about um what sort of constructions i'm looking for.	Offer
i think they're a whole lot multiple levels better.	Assessment/Appreciation
so .um.	Floor Holder
so we don't know what is the type of v a d which they're going to provide.	Other Answers
i mean it's there are too many applications to for them not to not do that.	Defending/Explanation
i mean it it just seems that like without that that outside input that you've got a situation where you know like if if uh x one says no	Statement
i think they	Statement
yeah that's also.	Accept
because um if you're dealing with power spectra then how are you going to choose your error.	Defending/Explanation
because it's hard to adjust the microphone.	Defending/Explanation
point.	Collaborative Completion
so i mean it's it's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time whatever in some kind of second pass.	Defending/Explanation
and it may be that that um we should early on make sure that they have the flexibility that we need.	Statement
so whether you're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience it's got to have something come down to it that gives its reward or you know at least some reinforcement learning.	Statement
it's just a matter of of work.	Defending/Explanation
yeah at this point.	Accept
and we had different levels.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then um the transcriber instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around and deciding if it's speech or not but not transcribing anything.	Statement
yeah i responded to i have already responded to him.	Accept
it will be enough.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial.	Statement
huh oh right.	Acknowledge-answer
so that that's another another way.	Statement
the fashion statement.	Humorous Material
but there's a lotta aspects to that to that project.	Negative Non-no Answers
i i should say	Statement
because it's it's a really nice graphic.	Assessment/Appreciation
well indeed.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and then they call this computer system that works perfectly and understands everything.	Humorous Material
okay that sounds great.	Acknowledge-answer
you know and that would be a reasonable thing to do.	Statement
i think you'd remember that yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
we'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this.	Offer
the left is	Statement
so sonorants and non sonorants is is is almost like voiced unvoiced except i guess that the voiced stops are are also called obstruents.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it it wouldn't affect things.	Collaborative Completion
so where you hesitate or where you start the repair there.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um i had a i spoke with some people up at haas business school who volunteered.	Floor Grabber
yeah give them a break.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah he was hard.	Accept
they end up on a different channel.	Expansions of y/n Answers
does um did anybody else want to say anything about	Yes-No-question
and i could be wrong.	Statement
you'd you want to not	Statement
yeah we're not doing digits in the in the room set up at all.	Acknowledge-answer
but uh no matter how they end up there it's not going to be unlimited amounts.	Defending/Explanation
and it can control uh how many it runs simultaneously.	Defending/Explanation
um the online uh data that adam set up.	Rising Tone
since you're looking at something that's sort of in log domain cepstral is like log linearly transformed of a log domain it's probably not that terrible an assumption to pretend it's gaussian anyway.	Assessment/Appreciation
because for example if these s have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty three possibilities.	Defending/Explanation
yeah the segmentations from don.	Accept
that might be interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean this would tell you what the hit is.	Statement
pretty you know.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i think that's probably the right way to do it.	Assessment/Appreciation
they just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say touring the castle.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i want to introduce the word snot-head into the conversation at this point.	Humorous Material
so um one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change.	Defending/Explanation
fey how long is it going to be till you have ten subjects?	Wh-Question
i mean how how he derived those filters.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um and uh construct queries.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's that's what i	Defending/Explanation
so uh let's see.	Floor Grabber
uh my hands got better.	Defending/Explanation
but if you use p. make then it knows about all the jobs that it has to run.	Defending/Explanation
but if it if you don't if it doesn't help you much at all um or put it another way if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people uh if their strategies do then	Statement
your mother's maiden name mother's maiden name.	Offer
but is better the second configuration.	Statement
but you know as a feature it might be okay.	Reject-part
so what uh bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it's closed or not.	Statement
whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable.	Statement
about having a synthesizer driven with	Statement
that that's true.	Accept
and so we want to avoid that.	Statement
i'm really not kidding.	Repeat
here's a relatively short meeting.	Statement
five zero?	Understanding Check
we can do that yeah.	Statement
and then the old uh wavefile and the new wavefile.	Statement
let me just go through the things that i wrote down as being important.	About-task
so a fairly simple back end.	Reformulate/Summarize
in the beginning did we do the strange pronunciation and then write p r n and what it really was meant to be?	Understanding Check
yes there's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency that is uh when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different we don't do as well as in the target thing.	Reformulate/Summarize
yeah so there was this conference call this morning.	Floor Grabber
sometime i debate with myself whether it's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually.	Statement
we didn't meet last week morgan.	Statement
in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says okay.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well i wonder if there's um if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of one in wonderful versus one as a digit being read.	Offer
not necessarily.	Dispreferred Answers
i don't think it gets at the the queries per se.	Rising Tone
but anyway what i was going to say is that although we're not going to have speech directed to a computer my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar.	Floor Grabber
if you were trying to do a remembrance agent.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so uh i mean there's lots of things you can do in second passes at all sorts of levels.	Floor Holder
and then we could have the phone phone.	Offer
everybody knows that.	Statement
how's it	Wh-Question
like you can't tell.	Collaborative Completion
which he does.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no you can just do it in as once you've done the training	Self-talk
i mean you're leaving.	Defending/Explanation
maybe it would work better if you'd already done some simple spectral subtraction.	Offer
except you get a lot of negatives the other way.	Statement
and what kind of number	Wh-Question
so is it it's it's clearer clear enough what the issue is.	Statement
but maybe	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i i i i i	Floor Grabber
we're going to call up your communicator thing.	Statement
oh right well	Acknowledge-answer
uh the third thing i like about it is	Floor Holder
the the the other the other thing is uh that we we talked about is give to them uh burn an extra c d rom.	Topic Change
we'd i think	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
or you're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives?	Declarative-Question
to get rid of the musical noise.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because they were reading from a script.	Defending/Explanation
i just i just couldn't do it in two minutes.	Defending/Explanation
none of them specifically said that they would do speaker i.d. or speaker change mark.	Defending/Explanation
so one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting.	About-task
well that that that's okay.	Downplayer
robert has taken his laptop back to germany so we needed a new synthesis machine.	Statement
so there'd you'd think there'd be a a factor of three or four in in uh cost function.	Expansions of y/n Answers
do you think this is going to be too too	Yes-No-question
and and uh i don't think there's any good reason for it in the application actually.	Floor Holder
but the projector's not part of your meeting.	Understanding Check
what project?	Expansions of y/n Answers
so it's like you know rather lively discussion there.	Statement
these things i would guess.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think one of the perplexing problems is	Statement
oh i have yeah i do have one other piece of information which uh i should tell people outside of this group too.	Commit
but in the middle two it's not applying to anything right?	Understanding Check
which is really giving them some improvement.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah i computed the um like the confidence level on the different test sets.	Floor Holder
so perhaps i think something like multi band trained on a lot of noises with uh features based targets could could could help.	Maybe
and potentially those things could probably be rendered.	Statement
that that um benefitted from online normalization.	Statement
if it's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense too.	Statement
makes it really hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean i we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries.	Downplayer
spectral subtraction?	Understanding Check
i think maybe something like that.	Maybe
because you're having a you have a system a dialogue system where you only have access to the what the speaker said before.	Defending/Explanation
or maybe it's just a link to get back to the conversation or something.	Dispreferred Answers
so you you were getting with the uh aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean t i digits when uh training the s r i system with clean t r digits t i digits.	Understanding Check
you know okay we'll go back to the hotel and then we'll go off.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean so if you take your window and build your histogram in this window um what you can expect is to have an estimation of of the noise in in the middle of the window.	Floor Holder
we're very proud of our time alignment.	Repeat
just do we don't need it's too specific.	Statement
schedule?	Understanding Check
like like no that's not what she said.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we don't know is happening.	Statement
we're talking about a snapshot.	Repeat
because nnn well uh we don't have complete result.	Defending/Explanation
okay it's just i'm just thinking that if	Floor Grabber
or vice versa yeah.	Mimic Other
and clearly some new stuff needs to be done here.	Floor Holder
you want to go ahead?	Offer
yeah because i figure no one's going to be able to figure it out.	Defending/Explanation
you know his x m l thing?	Declarative-Question
but it's i think that we've unless you think there's anything else i think that i've covered it.	About-task
but the but there's yeah but there is this one issue with them in that there're there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech.	Statement
oh well okay first of all it's not objects.	Statement
no no i mean like the the u.h.	Reject
okay not just sleeve them all?	Declarative-Question
it's just the idea that you have multiple channels to synchronize data.	Defending/Explanation
could you train a neural net to do spectral subtraction?	Rising Tone
it's pure	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
back back in the country.	Expansions of y/n Answers
doing the gain it's no problem.	Dispreferred Answers
it could be that our recognizer's actually doing relatively well.	Maybe
so you you plug your ears.	Action-directive
but i do do that because	Defending/Explanation
we want to incorporate certain data that would not be available during final tests uh under a a full fair test of it much as we are in the all the numbers that we have so far.	Defending/Explanation
no no especially uh overlapping speech from uh different uh uh speaker.	Reject
but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them.	Statement
okay so then it's fine.	Acknowledge-answer
oh you mean the voice quality?	Acknowledge-answer
yeah yets is not a word.	Self-talk
um how much worse is the short training set than the large one in terms of the ultimate performance?	Floor Grabber
well not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen probably even anyone under twenty one.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
hey what where are?	3rd-party-talk
i. ram group is paying for part of it.	Statement
and found that the	Statement

so you didn't get one.	Understanding Check
but sometime the sentence have only one digit.	Reject-part
but very very slow in comparison.	Assessment/Appreciation
wish you'd told me.	Repeat
this has caused me to wonder.	Defending/Explanation
in doing um some of our first automatic speech recognition models it may be useful to have that kind of data.	Defending/Explanation
you know i don't remember that.	Other Answers
because you can get really high.	Defending/Explanation
did you see that one?	Rising Tone
is it a is it	Yes-No-question
yeah names names in the names to i.d.'s.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but that's about it.	Rising Tone
is that is that going to be publicly available?	Yes-No-question
well if you look at it there are between like three and five groups.	Statement
but this uh would be nice though that you know we only have at most four at the moment um arrows going to each of the uh bottom decisions.	Offer
well spectral subtraction and online normalization don't seem to to go together very well.	Floor Grabber
uh good good.	Assessment/Appreciation
and we can try all of them.	Offer
yeah but they're not like	Floor Grabber
i think that's that seems uh that seems like a lot better idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
but if we send them without editing then we're also going to have to have uh notations for words that are cut off.	Statement
digits sure.	Acknowledge-answer
was that experiment done?	Rising Tone
um listen to it.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
because then they're not going to ask the questions that are in the summary.	Defending/Explanation
because the fact that you have these two nets that are different sizes means they behave a little differently.	Defending/Explanation
okay that was one question.	About-task
i mean i liked transcribing because i felt like i was much closer to the data.	Defending/Explanation
i think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names plus we'd have to tell everybody else.	Statement
no getting the coefficients.	Reject
i now have ten likely candidates.	Offer
and what they said is for the hardest tasks bad acoustics meeting settings it's thirty two dollars an hour.	Defending/Explanation
laugh period.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think the reason why it's not better is that the speechdat-car noises are all stationary.	Defending/Explanation
but we could use uh the the noisy version that timit.	Offer
so uh so the uh the new procedural change that just got suggested which i think is a good idea is that um we do the digit recordings at the end.	Floor Grabber
about um sixteen per cent or something of the error um if we use multi english instead of the matching condition.	Statement
you still end up with zeros in the spectrum.	Defending/Explanation
so so that may or may it that aspect of what he's doing may or may not be helpful.	Statement
correct?	Understanding Check
what happens there is it's around the same.	Reformulate/Summarize
so uh so in within the context of an utterance someone says so roger what do you think.	Floor Holder
i prefer i prefer the one on linguine or basmati.	Statement
it's like you're looking at the v a d.	Statement
you'll you'll we'll need to get the segmentations.	Understanding Check
do you think that'd be okay?	Yes-No-question
topic of this meeting is i want to talk a little bit about transcription.	Rising Tone
but i really i mean i'm i don't feel strongly enough that it's a good idea.	Downplayer
who was it trained on?	Wh-Question
he was doing something new?	Declarative-Question
if you knew you were doing that	Statement

yeah and here's the case where the english and the german might really be significantly different.	Floor Grabber
the p.d.a. one is very very ambitious.	Assessment/Appreciation

and we're trying to use something something else.	Rising Tone
and if they are then we'll try to get do it more.	Statement
um i i i would actually kind of like us to wind it down see if we can still get to the end of the uh birthdays thing there.	Floor Grabber
and so uh i do a an exhaustive listing of the forms	Rising Tone
i think it's better.	Assessment/Appreciation
and if it doesn't look like that's going to work we'll look at something else.	Commit
so that we can uh get our m l p features.	Statement
and it hadn't gotten far into it.	Defending/Explanation
is it an h p s g parser?	Rising Tone
people who were never at the meeting will have a very hard time understanding it otherwise.	Defending/Explanation
and then do some other normalization after.	Offer
you know maybe it's parallel.	Maybe
too bad you weren't here.	Humorous Material
uh you you were announce some things.	Statement
and this is um spectral subtraction plus what?	Declarative-Question
well use it.	Action-directive
so so what what she's done so far is sort of more or less breath not breath groups sort of phrases continuous phrases.	Floor Grabber
pure silence.	Acknowledge-answer
um what we've done in uh in the past is to use the neural net uh to transform um all of the features that we use.	Statement
i mean if we are using our own code for i mean that that could be the only difference.	Statement
do you want me to be there for that?	Rising Tone
and um you know	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

larry saul could be an idea.	Offer
where?	Rising Tone
or they're laughing when they're talking.	Statement

it's all going to sound like like sine waves to you more or less.	Defending/Explanation
yeah once we know which segmentations we're using.	Accept
just let them read it how they read it.	Collaborative Completion
you know profusely.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that is from the transcription and from the speaker segmentation.	Statement
well i think i think i think it's not a it's not at all unreasonable.	Floor Grabber
well finally we end up with this configuration that works uh quite well.	Rising Tone
a model to detect more the most accurately possible that is uh will be possible the uh the mark the change.	Statement
and you know i mean that was the meeting where um you know the the partitions wouldn't work.	Statement
because one of the bug was i was assuming that always the vad uh the initial frames were silence.	Defending/Explanation
you know you you look at the good one you look at the the screwed up one and and you can see the features in it without trying to.	Defending/Explanation
i should've got the digital camera.	3rd-party-talk
well that's more of a problem.	Negative Non-no Answers

uh if they	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so what's up with i b m chuck?	Rising Tone
it's very comfortable.	Assessment/Appreciation
no but i mean my question is like should i wait until all of those are processed and channelized?	Reject
because i think that um it would take so long for people to write that i think you wouldn't get as good a summary.	Defending/Explanation
saying so at the end of something.	Statement
how fascinating.	Assessment/Appreciation
so the speech the amount of speech that is missed by the detector for a good meeting i is around or under one percent i would say.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because we want to get that started.	Offer
i thought it was due at some hour during the day like five p m or something.	Defending/Explanation
what what happened with the different contexts?	Wh-Question

about the only difficulty with that is if it's compressed then you really do have to decompress it first.	Statement

whereas i think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things or three of you have some very fancy display uh and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out you'll have much more insight about what's going on.	Offer
it works better if what?	Wh-Question
i don't want them to be part of another utterance.	Negative Non-no Answers
uh it's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it's a noise that we definitely know what to do.	Rising Tone
and so you've lost information and yet it does better with with features than it does with the waveform.	Floor Holder
bye.	Acknowledge-answer
uh yeah i'm morgan.	Accept
i i don't know if these are word error rates.	Rising Tone
so here here's what it looks like to me.	Statement
and and we've already suggested i mean it's come up in this discussion that the suggestion that we could have um the timit categories for the american.	Offer
like if you have a p h d and you're hanging around here and you're not a professor and you're not a post doc then that's like what we are so there's a bunch of people like that.	Defending/Explanation
but i don't know if it	Other Answers
that's everything yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh so the end of a filled pause.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so just do that on the mel	Action-directive
even if it's centered.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean are there are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to?	Rising Tone
again we we i ran when we ran these we were sort of short on machines.	Downplayer
miss ed or	Expansions of y/n Answers
one approach would be um say m s g and p l p like was used in aurora one.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and it'll just be a trailing off and i'll think man i would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe.	Statement
and then the other person is like ha ha.	Statement
it ranges from being assigned to a transcriber to them finishing transcription to then being checked.	Rising Tone
when to put the quotes and when	Expansions of y/n Answers

i meant just see if they're any good.	Defending/Explanation
why do we need the email address for example?	Expansions of y/n Answers
is this the same as the e mail or different?	Or-Question
uh okay so uh then i guess the last thing i'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what jose has been doing.	Floor Grabber

well do but	Floor Grabber
they had divided things up into regions.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so we only have to give them credits.	Understanding Check

couldn't it?	Tag-Question
fey will carry out whatever we decide.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and we have to do it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and is that	Yes-No-question

and i was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it.	Statement
liz	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and i'm like you know i don't feel so lonely.	Statement
you don't?	Declarative-Question
and the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer.	Statement
we'd like you to do it.	Statement
the the idea of convincing them that we should use their network is fairly straight forward.	Defending/Explanation
so i'll uh try to get those as well.	Commit

well we're coming kind of close to the end of our time here.	About-task
no he uh he he has been solving all our problems or is wonderful.	Negative Non-no Answers
so the idea would be could we build an analyzer that would take an utterance.	Rising Tone
you only used that for digits.	Acknowledge-answer
okay you you you don't have a feeling for roughly how much it is?	Understanding Check
and then jane's idea of summarization afterward i think is not a bad one.	Assessment/Appreciation
why don't you why don't you just do it with aurora?	Rising Tone
what were they thinking of changing it to?	Wh-Question
and they and	Statement
i don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface.	Downplayer
because you're involved in gesture research.	Defending/Explanation
ho ho ho?	Understanding Check
but i was i was working on something else.	Defending/Explanation
and that certainly makes sense in in in a statistical interpretation that you know over um all possible realizations that they're uncorrelated.	Statement
stephane is working on spectral subtraction.	Statement
something that can be built up you know relatively quickly.	Reformulate/Summarize
but they'll just mark it as being there's some background stuff there.	Understanding Check
yeah that that's what we were planning to do.	Accept
yeah they won't.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah other than that uh	Floor Grabber
uhhuh so actually we started with the words.	Floor Grabber
so don't don't you think they overrate rather than underrate?	Rising Tone
it was over here sometimes.	Statement
so who is the user?	Rising Tone
and i know exactly like what the steps will work what's going on in the editing process.	Expansions of y/n Answers
tourist needs food badly.	Expansions of y/n Answers

would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it?	Rising Tone
morgan?	Declarative-Question
yeah but it tends to happen	Floor Grabber
and send them off to i.b.m.	Offer
how many iterations?	Wh-Question
it'll work the first time.	Statement
because i mean one remote possibility is that if we if we inherited that equipment if she weren't using it could we set up a room in the linguistics department?	Offer

i've never taken classes on it or anything.	Defending/Explanation
who cares?	Open-Question

i mean the point is we're going to generate this transcript with five five tracks in it but with no words.	Defending/Explanation

which is you know it's there's no particular reason that that's the right thing to do either.	Statement

it's a nice standard task.	Statement

so i think they're split up even further.	Assessment/Appreciation
okay and so this oh that	Floor Grabber
i think to	Statement

but obviously i can't really do most of it.	Reject-part
which is we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money.	Defending/Explanation

is it applied here or after the variance normalization?	Rising Tone
for obvious reasons probably.	Defending/Explanation
right so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere.	Follow Me
but there's not very many of these.	Statement
but i mean there are some that generalize over many meetings and there are some that don't and there are some things that happen in between meetings.	Defending/Explanation

so that we can set up.	Statement
so the next the second uh part of the table.	Rising Tone
maybe it would be better to add just white noise instead of speech shaped noise.	Maybe
great that solves that problem.	Assessment/Appreciation
and um so um	Floor Holder
could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question?	3rd-party-talk
because it just goes as	Defending/Explanation
right i mean we because you'd have several people with these pads you could collect different things.	Accept
good that	Assessment/Appreciation
because this is uh with multi english uh training.	Defending/Explanation
and the thing is this doesn't have neural net in yet for instance.	Defending/Explanation
i do remember that yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
we could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage.	Offer
without really stopping.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh so this this notion of putting down the p.z.m.'s and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table.	Floor Holder
and maybe that's all.	Maybe
so i mean if you can do all these in word errors it's a lot a lot easier actually.	Floor Grabber
so that if any part of the word was overlapped it was considered an interrupted word.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like a sort of an	Expansions of y/n Answers
so that you would typically have two or three basically syllable kind of length	Statement
yeah that's that's been changed.	Acknowledge-answer
in conversational speech in particular.	Collaborative Completion
there we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things.	Rising Tone
but that that's not hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
so so what would happen if we sent a note saying gee we've talked about this and couldn't we change this uh the whole word?	Offer
because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just um starting of speech and end of speech uh at the utterance level.	Defending/Explanation
other people may not agree with that.	Rising Tone
um and i'm going to to try to to look at those patterns to to see um from those patterns	Statement
but the the amount of the amount of noise i add is not the same for all the frequency bins.	Defending/Explanation
well you were saying i think it can read	Statement
and interesting is more interesting than important.	Expansions of y/n Answers
machines.	Mimic Other
p.d.a. right.	Statement
that'd be fun.	Assessment/Appreciation
and for for every every sub band you you just pick ahead of time um i'm going to have like five independent logistic tests.	Statement
just trying to give you a hard transcription task.	3rd-party-talk
and so we were not planning on doing the transcribing the entire thing.	Floor Holder
you can you can masking tape it together.	Offer
hey what about me?	Floor Grabber
yeah i've i've looked at it.	Accept
and then leave leave everything in place until the back up until the next full back up.	Offer
okay right?	Declarative-Question
well this is the dimension.	Repeat
let's say that in in second fifty seven of one minute you start talking and i start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds.	Offer
and if they're still that big?	Understanding Check
but it may help	Statement
is it the three i see?	Yes-No-question
because he said generally speaking in order to to go against that kind of a claim you'd have to big canvassing.	Defending/Explanation
uh right now it's um a neural net with nine frames.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
i mean it's very different if you have a group that's just giving a report on what they did that week versus coming to a decision and so forth.	Floor Holder
what what does the speech recognizer care?	Humorous Material
because it's like how effective is you know the roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make?	Defending/Explanation
this is cubic root of power spectra?	Understanding Check
that's pretty much true.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah because it just i mean it just subtracts it out.	Accept
um and uh shifting it downwards and then getting rid of the negative parts that's essentially throwing away the low energy things.	Statement
it's it's nicer to have a pad than not.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
which is to say just laptop with a wireless.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because that's that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants.	Defending/Explanation
you can tell by the prosody.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
over their system what they submitted.	Statement
when you don't have speech these minima will give you some noise level estimate.	Statement
so well it would be lunch afterwards.	Negative Non-no Answers
so it's uh basically the same except that we don't have this uh low pass filtering so we have only two streams.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
anyway so in general this is the design this is really design problem.	Floor Holder
uh them i i i don't remember what is the the name of the of the author.	Other Answers
and your email is?	Declarative-Question
uh so i guess that's the way what you were figuring on doing was was was uh putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody.	Understanding Check
so i want to know a lot about it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
not necessarily so phonological.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yes uhhuh yeah.	Accept
because this takes time.	Defending/Explanation
or a simple neural net.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i just want to be sure we don't that we're able to process uh you know as much data as we can.	Statement
and then the technical set up regarding the um auditory image and the interface.	Offer
you view each complex pair as essentially a second order section.	Statement
not not the transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the sort of figuring out how to synchronize all of these um pieces.	Negative Non-no Answers
uh so i'm going to run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state.	Statement

yeah in general you don't	Acknowledge-answer
oh yeah then i guess i have.	Accept

uh i mean because i was already sort of suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they're doing.	Floor Holder
you know it's just basically.	Statement
and so my next plan would be	Statement
i like that idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
eighty three point six and eighty eighty eight point six.	Statement
have never gotten a response from from any of the emails about uh permission forms.	Statement
there are more.	Statement
instead of the log you took the root square i mean cubic root or something.	Understanding Check
so yeah but we've	Floor Grabber

what what can i do to	Wh-Question
and so um um if you take um all the things all the uh speak things marked s p k and uh look for the voiced uh energy in them	Offer
well well i guess.	Reject-part
in in terms of what?	Signal-non-understanding
something went wrong.	Statement
because you get a sense also of posture.	Defending/Explanation
and so you'll get you'll get down to one point two x. by the time you get done.	Defending/Explanation
because i think there was probably an uh an indication that that i was interested in advance.	Statement
sometimes it doesn't pick up backchanneling though.	Statement
for the italian even seven digits more or less.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
hey there's a strike on uh does that affect whether or not you want to go or something.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so say twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time.	Statement
yeah i was thinking if transcriber were invented in italy or something it would have been handling multiple	Acknowledge-answer

well not clear.	Floor Holder

um because my name was was mentioned when i wasn't around.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
but well if you look over a range of these different tests um how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the m l p features uh stand up over that range?	Open-Question
you know i i should i should do something now.	Statement
and it's predictable apparently.	Statement
so what he was doing is basically you you do estimate the pitch.	Statement
because i generally have the volume turned up to above normal volume just so i can hear more clearly.	Defending/Explanation
i i'm not exactly sure about that.	Other Answers
what was that what how did you phrase it?	Rising Tone
right so i've been looking at spectral tilt.	Floor Grabber

nancy is currently in berkeley but not here?	Understanding Check
um and um i was thinking about ways to to generalize this.	Floor Holder
i mean it just it feels so quick.	Defending/Explanation
but uh if you told him a bunch of stuff then you would ask him do you want to go.	Statement
i mean i don't think either of us would mind	Defending/Explanation
okay so do do you know what we're going to do?	Rising Tone

actually i wanted to talk with you about that.	Statement

someone who's just gotten their p h d uh could be very very uh strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been twenty years out could be shy you know	Statement

all of that sort of stuff is things that they're debating in their standards committee.	Statement
yeah dave dave uh is um also going to be playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff.	Floor Grabber
so seems like we're winding down.	Floor Grabber
this is because it's um there are these different parameters for the shape of these basis functions um there are a lot of different possible basis functions.	Statement
