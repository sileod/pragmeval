sigma...*sigh*...lets start off getting one thing straight. are you suggesting that legal makes moral?	no, neither am i suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. legality and morality are completely separate things.	notsarc
we have post-graduate and internation student halls, but most of the other post-grads are students anyway (or it might be because scotland secretly considers me as a international student being from england)	oh ok, so i assume you don't live in your own house? i was trying to picture over 61 people fitting into one house. :)	sarc
since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.now we all know that i am made in the image and likeness of god and since god is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect. to state less would mean that god is not perfect. so if i am the image and likeness of god, then either i am perfect or god is not.	"think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is ""wrong"" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image"	notsarc
john kerry is a gigilo and married 2 rich women and teresa heinz married john heinz to get her money..... get a clue......	i love it how no mention of bush can go long without the word nazi! emoticonxrolleyes	sarc
mexico city's homicide rate today is about on par with los angeles and is less than a third of that for washington, d.c.mexico city's rate was about 9 per 100,000 in 2008, while washington, d.c. was more than 30 that year.	but i thought it was the easy gun laws in the u.s. that made mexico's cities a shooting gallery? same as l.a. and less than d.c.?   amid drug war, mexico less deadly than decade ago	sarc
that is of course absurd! you are pretending based on a psychological issue of yours. take your pick from the conservative intellectual canon - aristotle, chesterton, strauss, de tracy, jefferson, madison, monroe, adam smith, john locke, milton friedman, nosick, hayak, von mises, sowell, wm. buckley, kirk, burke, q. wilson, rand, patrick henry, c.s lewis, voegelin, belloc. who said what you claim conservatives say?	i see some names that don't seem to fit. c.s. lewis was a writer and scholar, you want to include tolkien too? aristotle was a prolific thinker but hardly conservative. it is as if you are trying to graft liberal (proper use of the word) philosophy on to traditionalism. you have rand, do you mean rand paul or ayn rand? quotes about the size of government from conservatives and founder types... it is the size of government that matters, not necessarily how it is financed. - dan mitchell senior fellow in political economy, the heritage foundation my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. - jefferson government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. - thomas paine  what do you have to say about the 'proper' size of government?	notsarc
...and how military personnel are no barrier to repealing gay exclusion rules, its good for a laugh.	if congress decides to remove the law, what can the military do?nothing.logically, they're not a barrier...	notsarc
"the greatest possible (anything you can name) can only exist in a finiteseries. as you point out, this is not the case in an infinite series such asintegers. so the definition that began this thread that god is identified as""the greatest being possible"" must limit the possibilities to a finite number.as i write this i can see that it's self-evident - but what i can't see is howthis gets us any closer to showing that god exists (or not) !"	"this is why the title is ""god exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). it's a funny proof which i don't think christians would agree this definition was god. but basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. call the greatest god. god exists.not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. the proof is one big circle :)"	notsarc
that's why you don't find them much below the arctic circle. anyway, the change still isn't evolution. that's my claim	what's your claim? that the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? as usual, your responses show muddled thinking.	notsarc
"do you not understand what is currently going on?the ruling on whether the california state constitutional amendment was enacted ""legally"" was ruled on by the courts.what is discussed above is entirely separate.to say something brief to get you up to speed, our state constitution cannot violate the federal constitution.so if prop 8 violates the 14th amendment, then prop 8 loses.whether or not prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined."	if doma isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against prop 8 are micturating into the wind.	notsarc
i see no way the federal government can force states to marry gays.	well, you must not be a gop lawmaker or the president of the united states. they're convinced that the only way to prevent the scotus finding in favor of same-sex marriage is to amend the constitution.	sarc
just because you think you are entitled to what i earn doesn't make it so. earn your own.	said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man.	notsarc
** absolute nonsense. ** utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. ** you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites.	absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years.	sarc
materialists: believe that lifeforms are evolving upwards from something ugly (bacteria, fungues, etc) by way of a purely physical mechanismâ€¦(no thought or intelligence required)	you can forget the loaded language including false notions of progress. lifeforms are evolving by way of purely physical and chemical mechanisms.	notsarc
i'm sure invading armies would be deterred by people sniping them off at random (which is what would happen if any ever tried an invasion of america, especially in the rural areas)	"there is some truth here. did you ever see ""independence day""? they were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived. it didn't stop the aliens... sure only a film... let's look at real life...modern - iraq - sadaam gave guns out to the people just before gulf war iinot so modern - boer war - dutch farmers in south africa were all excellent marksmen - britain still invaded.us civil war - i believe that the confederate states were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned. us still invaded."	notsarc
you are not implying that catholics shouldn't have the right to use the media to put forth ideas on politics, culture, and society are you?	no - but they certainly have a bias. as do we all.	sarc
"leviticus 18:22 ""do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable."""	"when you are menstruating, do you make sure you don't touch anyone so that you don't make them ""unclean""? if not, you better start."	sarc
want the list of military actions he engaged in as president?	is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james.	sarc
why do you feel that childern concieved through rape have a lesser right to life then childern concieved through consenual sex? if you consider abortion to be murder, just why do you support murder in specific cases.	can you think of the mental trauma of having your rapists baby? and then caring for it? for rape victims, no i still don't think abortion should be the first choice, but it should be available.	notsarc
they would open up to sicknesses far more easily when wounded, hardly the sort of thing a species wants.	again, modern birds seem to do fine as do gliding mammals such as flying squirrels.	notsarc
well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. so do i understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?	you are just playing dumb, right? there will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment per insured. their pay will not be cut. there will be fewer of them per insured. initially the absolute volume will increase.	sarc
well, i've written another letter to the editor. kind of late in the week, so i don't know if it will get printed because of time constraints ... or maybe because of its content. this time i've stepped it up a notch or two. no way for me to have another friendly little chat with my dentist if this get's printed and he reads it.	that should get the natives milling around looking for victims. fundamentalist christianity does not take kindly to criticism.	sarc
and al shots in the ten range. and in response to zachvac i mean guns not arms (as in nukes) but im fine with automatics and such in the right hands.	that wasn't my question. my question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. you sort of answered that. but the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb.	notsarc
i live in a place where local evening news includes a story about children being shot or killed at least weekly.	"what exactly are the age ranges of these ""children"" in the news stories?"	sarc
but evolutionists are just as religious as christians: they have their own unseen miracles â€“ (random mutations)â€¦.their own clergy (scientists)â€¦their own bible (the origin of species)....and their own god (natural selection).	"well said.   with this religion, the gap is very wide between the ""average guy"" and ""authority"", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of christianity, or the creator himself. it fits with more democrats being evolutionists, and more democrats favoring bigger domestic government."	notsarc
isaac newton sought out the hand of god, through science. he is a prime example of what i mean.	do you mean someone who was wrong? i asked you before to give an example of where newton found empirical evidence of god. you failed to do so. i suspect that you can't.	notsarc
have you considered a career in advertising? by the way you f***ed us too. australians troops were cannon fodder in wwi for the british empire, remember gallipoli?	d'ya think i should? make a mel gibson film and suddenly everyone's an expert eh? well despite what his gibson-ness would have us believe, gallipoli was a case of bad luck, incompetence and generals f*cking everyone over regardless of nationality. remember we lost huge numbers of british troops too. now i don't downplay the role of the anzacs, or their losses. but this was at a time when the british considered australians to be one and the same as themselves. there was hardly the conscious effort to use the anzacs as fodder over the tommies. gallipoli was a blunder (though again not as big a blunder as populist history has us believe) for everyone, regardless of nationality. there was certainly no sinister us and them between our nations- we were essentially considered as one.	sarc
he presented no arguement as to why he thought that this was not mere reflex action. as someone with only a minimum of medical knowledge, i personally cannot tell the difference between reflex action and a true sense of pain. that is true for most of us and seems to be true for this physician. i am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester.	well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain.	notsarc
you mean 8 months before 9-11 baby? do you think slick willie knew about any thing beside tail? online rumor mill spins its own myth(snopes.com's leftwing bias undercuts its credibility) who else here is aware that snopes is a liberal left website? - yahoo! answers snopes.com left wing authority - toyota tundra forums : tundra solutions forum do you find the fact-checking site snopes.com to be biased? | buzzdash ruthless roundup: snopes lies in defense of snopes a modest construct snopes' liberal political agenda ~ notoriously conservative	psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!	sarc
abortions hurt much more than they heal. not just phsyically (side effects can occure months afterward) but psychologically as well. guilt, depression, so forth. in my view, abortion is murder, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality. even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does. they're at least alive while they kill their baby. that in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves.i believe these testimonies to be real, and i feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations' reputations to kill their own child. it really is sad.	"what i've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. they stay quietly in the background-computer base -until, as you said: hopefully, the person ""finds some way of forgiving themselves"", right. but what about in the mean-time? - and we know, from research & quite a number of healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.much better to life benevolently, in the first place.annie"	notsarc
george w. bush is very anti-choice and pro-death penalty. he loves to pull the executioner's switch. see next post of bush's mockery of karla faye tucker.	not only would i throw the switch, i'd pay the electric bill, too. emoticonxgood	sarc
just like god, i can only decide about you with the evidence i have available. everything about the way you act says i'm right; your protestation ring as hollow as a really, really hollow thing. (i never claimed to be a master of metaphor :) ) you never miss a chance to tell everyone that you're going to heaven and they aren't. sounds like someone boasting about their exclusive country club to me. there's certainly no humility in the way you present yourself.	really? i never miss the chance to tell everyone that i'm going to heaven? i challenge you to quote me ever bragging that i'm going to heaven and you're not. what i have done is promised you mockers and scoffers that the day will come when you will learn the truth about how wrong you are to reject the living god. but never have i boasted that i am going to heaven while you're not. and never has my motivation for promising you that you will ultimately learn the truth been to make such a point. so quote my posts kronus. prove me wrong and defend your lying claim. and i want links to posts in context to the debate and point being made at the time.	sarc
so they (pro-life peeps) say abortion is murder. of course, you can only murder people. so their rule is that fetuses (feti?) are people also. but then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the us census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage. pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.or am i missing something? care to clarify, anybody who disagrees?	yes, you are missing something. how come age doesn't start at conception? how come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old.	notsarc
those kind of websites are like porn to gun nutsbut getting big gun wont compensate for being born with a small one	just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.	sarc
did i just see a draw pistol and shoot ones self in foot here?	your foot would do service as a colander. in australia, a weapon may be legally held for many reasons. self defence is not one of them. you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting, but use it to defend yourself. how hard is that to understand? for a supposed 'expert' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot, is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners.	sarc
see, here you've seperated mind, spirit, soul. the bible didn't do this, unless zechariah is being misinterpreted. it basically said, in your interpretation, that the spirit and the soul are the same thing.	yes, it is very hard, even for theologians, to explain.	notsarc
"if someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the ""evolution of the universe"" because it will just waste time."	"now you're being ridiculous. the big bang is not the evolution of the universe. the words ""evolution of the universe"" do not necessarily entail the big bang. for example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.but claiming that the ""evolution of the universe"" is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because kate hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?by the way, i have always heard the creationist invention ""gte"" referred to as the general theory of evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity."	notsarc
"you mean just like the continually debunked lie of ""95% of all weapons found in mexico came from america""? the lie that not even the atf will stand behind? the lie that was purported based on successful traces of the minute number of weapons mexico turned over to be traced and identified, while keeping the vast majority from law enforcement?"	"about a third of the weapons seized in mexico were referred to the u.s. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   about half were successfully traced. better than 90% of those to u.s. dealers.   of course your definition of ""minute"" might differ from mine."	sarc
evolution may attempt to explain how life developed here, but it proves nothing which is why this debate is persistent and never-ending. and exogenesis is the evolutionists fall back explanation for that which they can't prove or justify otherwise, but leave it to the liars that your side is to attempt to attribute to us what you yourself is claiming. beside the fictional links, everything else is from pro-evolution sources and explanations for this other theory for how life appeared on earth. even dawkins has referred to it as a rational consideration for how original life appeared so many alleged billions of years ago on earth. read this link: the physics of the universe - the beginnings of life - exogenesis then read my posted info below and see if it isn't spot on based on what is being claimed in the link above. i rest my case. 	a double helping of insulting spam? i'm honoured....emoticonxgood how interesting that you selectively belittle crick's comments on panspermia while lauding his debunked tornado in a junkyard conjecture.	sarc
and for decades, evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the book of lifeâ€¦.they said that individual genes controlled individual traits. well all that came to a crashing halt when the human genome project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes â€“ over 100,000 short of their estimate. this meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped.	so a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?	notsarc
you tell me that job and jonah are fiction. i tell you that evolution is fiction. maybe we are both right.	no. not only are you wrong, you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. you oppose evolution you say, but you have no idea of what it is. most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh.	sarc
[quote=zachvac]i'm just saying that i'm using the exact same reasoning as you yet you reject my sleep requirement and accept a drug test. bull sleep and drugs are completley different. what you fail to provide when saying this is how sleep can be just as violent as drugs.	how are they different? both can lead to depression, impaired judgement and decrease in ability. what is the difference? you can't just claim they are completely different and leave it at that. how are they different? you say i fail to provide how sleep [loss] can be just as violent as drugs. you or epaphras_faith have yet to prove that drugs can cause violence. i have just proved that sleep loss causes a decrease in ability and impairs judgement and leads to depression. you haven't proven anything more that drugs does.	notsarc
as if 'broadening' something can't possibly dilute it.i'm just sure a glass of napa valley merlot would taste better if we broaden it by pouring in a half-glass of chardonnay. wine is wine, huh? emoticonxrolleyes if you can't understand the concept of sacredness, i doubt there's anything anyone will be able to tell you that would ever make a difference.	again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. as if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.   what a sad and mean little man you are.	sarc
even better were does it say that evolution is proven?	in the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.	sarc
no i mean why not for people. can we not control our selves?	do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole.	notsarc
just when you are ready to come get my guns...... remember!	and you're accusing him of not debating properly? that's the best you can do?	sarc
so you don't support connecticut passing a civil union law?	it's a flawed step in the right direction. i support it compared to nothing. i did not support it when they were considering cus vs. full marriage. they took the politically expedient way out.lest you leap to any unwarranted conclusions, my main objection is the blatent inequality inhererent in cus.	notsarc
i saw the same thing amongst the jehovah's witnesses. they even encouraged it. get, married - get a job. they also strongly discourage post-secondary education. its like they knew that once these kids hit college they would a) get too horny, b) find reasons to question their faith. but then the witnesses are absolutely whacked. so are the mormons.	"you don't want anyone saying gay people are whacked, but you will make it your business to insult someones religion?! you are a hypocrite!! you say,""don't judge gays!"" but you are judging people by their religon?! i thought you were more mature then that. hey you live ad learn.emoticonxrolleyes"	sarc
self defense for dummies- shoot a police officer concealed carry cop killers.mov - youtube	v.p.c. once again i am shocked and awed. why no mention of our fearless atf'sand the agents they caused to be killed. and all the mexican citizens they have caused to be killed? oh wait if the vpc did that it would be kinda like jumping outta bed with your partner.special note: some atf agents are fearless.drug war victims drug warrantthese are a few of the one known about.it works both way's brady and more our way much more.	sarc
where's the part about mexico in the story?  i'll bet they planned to sell them to guys like you... once again, regulation isn't necessarily restriction.	awwww, is little sliiiiiiicky still unhappy with the elections? kiss nancy again and cry on her shoulder we are tired of it. let her wipe your snot nose and have a nice hot cup of tea. :) emoticonxhoho while you are at it, exactly what is the difference between 'regulation' and 'restriction' ? i notice your dope sucking law didn't pass in kalifornia so is that going to stop you? iow, if you don't get caught it is all right? is that your standard for regulation or restriction?	sarc
2. preventing a poor/unhappy life, 2. you have no idea whether the unborn will be 'unhappy', or even poor, for their lifetime. it would be more sensible to evaluate a person's life at, age 10 perhaps, and then kill them if they have been unhappy and are likey to continue. again, anyone on welfare is a likely target. in fact, it might be expedient to simply nuke the poorest parts of the world.	if the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?	notsarc
so, one set of creationists are xxxxxx, but the others are not?	well done monty. mark that up as your first ever 100% honest and accurate post here.	notsarc
i am using the same definition. however, i do not place confidence in scientists.	oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?	sarc
we are human at conception. the sperm and ovary cells are human before they even connect. a fingernail clipping is human.what you mean is; when do we become a person.	no! at conception we are a person and human.all living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.a fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.the sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.the unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the dna from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique dna that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.	notsarc
true. it would have to go through the lower courts unless 'fast-tracked'. scotus could rule that ffca isn't applicable because it is a license issue and not a statute. that's the sad state of affairs that exists today. we can't depend on the scotus acting in accordance with the constitution. emoticonxmad  imo, the creation, by an activist scotus, of a phantom right is more dangerous than the loss of that bogus right. if we had a scotus that foillowed the constitution and didn't dabble in legislating, i wouldn't be fearful of 'big brother'. there are 'real' safeguards to protect us from that possibility, so we don't need scotus to 'make up' new ones.	this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional.	notsarc
this is a poor poor analogy. abortion is dealing with the decision to end another's life in order to sustain a preferred lifestyle.	chloe, the point of this thread is to help you understand what the argument is, not to give analogies to abortion.	notsarc
ez is not a pseudo-intellectual snob he is an anti-intellectual fool.you need to get it together man, you make a lot of mistakes when you are emotionally over invested.	yea i guess you're right, you people tend to blur together after a time.	sarc
that is nothing but conjecture. are you telling me that arctic foxes at some point in history did not have this ability?	actually, it's not conjecture. the genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. the dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. the dominant allele is most likely ancestral. but even foxes below the arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. so yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.	notsarc
an independant perspective doesn't make it a good thing. politicians that propose anti-gun legislation don't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect, they shouldn't be allowed to propose it.	ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. we'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. sorry civil rights legislation!	sarc
this isnt true just because you are one exception doesn't make what i said false. i said people who prefer samsung are often people who know stuff about computers and soft ware.	i am really surprised this one got so many upvotes :p	notsarc
its good to see the senate isnt agreeing.	isn't agreeing with what? the senate hasn't passed any laws that would restrict right to carry anymore than it already is.	notsarc
be careful lesz, your hatred for me and your bigotry towards the bible and christianity is showing again. emoticonxwow after all, i didn't write the verses that condemn homosexuality, i just posted them.	and neither did god write them. they were writen by men and there was no devine inspiration. there is no difference between the bible and margaret mitchell's gone with the wind. oh yes i am sorry gone with the wind at least gets history correct.	sarc
what's this to do with guns?	this has everything to do with guns,how are these people suppose to protect   themselves?since the police have been told to just let them go, crime will run   rampant, it will become the place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary,gosh wonder if they gotta let rapo's and killers runaway to.   only 2000? i lived in george wa. and the population was less than 2000,it was also just off i-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not   necessarily from people who lived there.	notsarc
boys can urinate standing up. can girls do that? i think not.	wow you can piss standing up, that's loads better than multitasking, manipulating, linguistics and arts. well done you!	sarc
have you lost your mind? i got no idea what you are talking about.	deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. you cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what i thought. in fact, some of the cited refute such claims.	notsarc
that happens, too. for example, our gene for vitamin c is broken and no longer works. .	that's an interesting subject, i had not heard of that b4. did our bodies once produce vitamin c?.	notsarc
you prefer me i am your target since the beginning. when i took a break from cd and came back you are so happy that you message me like 5 times begging for me to let you be my ally i still have them but i am not going to copy and paste them here because you will cry like you did with hellno. cheap words from a false witness that doesn't know knowing but satanic claims.	oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0	sarc
carefully think about this statement. christianity is based upon the essential beliefs that:1. god is all-powerful2. man is fallen and in need of redemption	well, there is a little more to it than that, but agreed.	notsarc

supersport, do you believe in a creator that purposely doomed human beings to inevitable genetic destruction? after all, if what you claim is true, human beings have no choice but to 'devolve.'	yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected.	notsarc

in a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information.	"what are you talking about? please define information. what does ""new"" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? evolution is not defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.so i ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to dna and the genome of an organism."	notsarc

i guess you're reading it wrong, then. back then, marriage was a commitment to one another and did not have legal meanings. that's just it. if you want to go by the original definition of marriage, like so many anti-gay people talk about, no one who gets a marriage should get legal benefits. however, they would never be willing to give this up, so by denying gays the right of those same benefits for the same commitment, it is just pure and unadulterated bigotry. by the way, look at post #9 to see what i think of the whole civil union movement.	so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down.	sarc

"the militia of the second amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in article 1 of the constitution). in our own day, i think the national guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. alexander hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:""it requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. it would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. this desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. it is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states, reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress.""the federalist papers - thomas (library of congress)we could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. but the supreme court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- second amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the second amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia."	well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. the framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.	notsarc

the problem with your statement is that freedom of religion is specificly enumerated in the bill of rights. government recognition of marriage is not. as i have told mathew s on numerous occasions, you are free to put forth an initative, in your state, to ban government recognition of opposite sex marriages or all marriages. you are also free to vote your opinion on such initatives, but so is everyone else.	marriage is not a religious institution. it is a government contract nothing more. many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. need proof? you can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. and because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. and it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   but as i have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. civil rights never should be.	notsarc

"i would like to address the theory of evolution point-by-point. since i do not want to misrepresent the theory, i have used an explanation of darwin's theory from gould's book, ""full house."" on page 138, gould states:1) all organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.2) offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.3) this variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (we know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)4)if many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents. the accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change."	a fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a phd in biology).	notsarc

the only reason that it will be a mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain. you have to remember that the human mind is not just a hard drive. it is also the processor (brain) as well as the motherboard (connector of inputs and outputs) and the ram (short term memory). there is nothing else in the human body that can better fit the role of any of these four components. this is also the core of what determines if a computer is a mac or a pc. if you take all these pieces from your pc and put them in a mac then you have a pc. this is the case since you will be able to run pc-only applications and not mac-only applications.	well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer.	notsarc

i am offering any of you creationists, christians, etc, the chance to prove me wrong. of course, to have this chance, you must also accept that i have full ability to argue with you. i used to be a christian, but after extensive studying and questioning, threw it away. do not talk to me unless you have a somewhat open mind to argue things. my aim is pikeman852003 my icq is 117686925 my msn is pikeman85@hotmail.com if you want to argue with me, add me. i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of. i have convinced several people to severly question or even give up their faith using reasoning and facts. argue with me at your own risk. i originally posted this on the old forums, then learned they were obsolete.	i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so.	notsarc

no, of course sexuality isn't strictly about behavior. the point is that religious belief about behavior is about behavior. of course i agree with you about sexuality, but that is a different issue. the point is that it is not innateness that is opposed by religion. it is a behavioral issue. saying something someone does is immoral is not the same as saying they are immoral.	i do appreciate your point while i disagree on principle. i guess it boils down to the fact that even if i believed in a god i couldn't accept that he would command us to suppress our true innate nature. why would he makes us that way and then expect such a thing? christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what god commands. to suppress a good many natural inclinations. to accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel.	notsarc

legislative solutions and popular appeal are not the same thing. the legislature is hired to do what's right, not what's popular. that aside, where has the gay rights movement used voting as anything except a measure of last resort? if gays knew they could count on popular support they wouldn't need to fight to get their rights protected. we know this. we also know that's there's lots of big money opposing gay rights, and sadly enough money is often the deciding factor in voting. so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement?	well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.	notsarc

however, my point is that emotions alone cannot build a case for theism or atheism. when such is the case, it is no different from a religion	"i think bringing ""emotions"" into the question of whether god exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in god ? an emotional attachment to ""non-belief"" would be irrelevant (and irrational)."	notsarc

"you claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of ""empirical fact"", this is just not so. i think you should rethink what ""empirical fact"" is. empirical fact, are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation. if i see a light on in a room, that is an empirical observation, and for me, that the light is on, is an empirical fact. however, if you and i both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on, i think, is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb. i say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function, you say its something else, and that's a mater if ideology, not mere observation."	"so for example if i say ""you are a part of my body, and therefore i have a right to kill you"", is this simply a matter of ideology?i admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are ""a part"" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?it is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside."	notsarc

that is not quite what the 'mitochondrial eve' hypothesis posits. science. 1995 dec 22;270(5244):1930-6.  the myth of eve: molecular biology and human origins. ayala fj. university of california, irvine, usa. it has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the 'mitochondrial eve' who lived in africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. the human immune system drb1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the old world monkeys. the theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. molecular evolution data favor the african origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. the mitochondrial eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies. if god transported them, we immediately have removed the flood myth from the realm of science. as if the flood itself did not do this already...	'if' is the question. it suggests that holy tradition does not know the answer.   secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   ps i have already discussed m-eve on another post.	notsarc

"lack of a natural mechanism. charles darwin, in his origin of species, proposed natural selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. darwin defines evolution as ""descent with modification."" however, natural selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps natural selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. however, this is theoretical and controversial, since ""beneficial"" mutations have yet to be observed. in fact, scientists have only observed harmful, ""downward"" mutations thus far. time constraints. both creationists and evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. for much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. if the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. in 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. by 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. however, young earth advocates have identified quite a few young earth chronometers in recent years. currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a ""young earth"" than an ""old earth."" each discovery is a separate ""limiting factor"" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. for example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. each limiting factor is distinct. if one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. furthermore, there are limiting factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities."	you are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. all inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old.

well, that depends what far fetched ideas someone has i imagine.  so lets get this straight; you say it is fine to pick and choose which bits of the bible you accept, but it is not okay to try revisit passages in the light of other knowledge from outside the bible? i just ask because i find that an interesting position to adopt.	if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said.	sarc
since reverend hellhound insists on using an antique definition of 'well-regulated', i think it will be interesting to examine an antique definition of 'the people'. the founders defined 'the people' rather narrowly.  john adams explained that women were not part of 'the people' because 'nature has made them fittest for domestic cares' and women were unfit for 'the great business of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as the arduous cares of the state'. servants and those who didn't own land were also not part of the people because they were 'too little acquainted with public affairs to form a right judgement, and too dependent upon other men to have a will of their own.'

that is an incorrect statement. viability seems to be the topic that gets little mention here. humanity, consciousness, personhood, sentience, etc. are all extremely debatable, as has been demonstrated, sometimes ad nauseam.	to you, it may be an incorrect statement. but if it is, you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote. not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it.	notsarc
600? oh really? looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time. making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic. the fact that there aren't specifics is a key failure in your argument. if the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate, terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere, yet they are not. you are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is. once again, anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition.	well, i guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. it's up to you.	sarc
no, but abiogenesis does, and they are 2 sides of the same coin as they are presented as one process following the other. it is so deceptive and disingenuous to constantly separate them as unique processes while all the time knowing that one study is the scientific continuation where the other ends. you are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms. so stop with the denial and word games and face the truth for once in your life.	i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around.	sarc
this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air	the human collective is the authority. one major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.	notsarc

i don't think pro-choicers in general care whether or not abortion is truly rare. if they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare, and not just legal.	i know you're talking to jessica, so i will only comment on this. it would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.if pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.take the current debates for example. my entire point is that it should not be illegal. that abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). we spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.	notsarc
i find it funny how a person can see how wrong it is to kill a baby after cutting it from a womb, yet they don't think it's wrong while the baby is still in it. that's what baffles me about pro-choicers(pro-abortionist). i wonder if there were a glass window allowing people to see what they are killing, if they would still feel no emotion.	why do you think they feel no emotion? all the women i know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them.most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts. they are real women, with real issues, and real circumstances that lead them to that choice. want to help those babies? address the issues the women face and don't demonize. no amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother. dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone.	notsarc

peter was obviously there are more writings of peter apart from the gospel of mark and 1 & 2 peter you find in the bible.... you will discover it is not only the bible that the church use for their deposit of faith but a number of other writings regarded as sacred tradition. it was peter and the apostles who had influence over paul not vice versa. if peter and the apostles influenced paul and peter had primacy among the apostles obviously it was peter who influenced the church not paul, since paul was influenced by peter!	if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right.	notsarc

according to this, there are 1,531,764 crimes stopped by guns this year (and it's not even the end of the year yet!). it also gives a reasonable explanation of why you don't see this on the news every day. it also says that legal gun owners account for almost 0% of all gun crime. so if you want to ban guns, 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured, and you'll only take guns out of the hands of those who don't even commit gun crimes.	but if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the nspof are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves. 	notsarc
but i do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry.	the value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. for you, one axiom is the existence of vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.there is no logical reason for you to deride ns the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. but your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into eam and getting on with your life.	notsarc

a bump of the topic. it seems that any evolutionist with any knowledge of this topic has either quit this board or been banned. yet there is no response by creationists. why is that? is it that garioch is correct? is it that creationists are making assertions without understanding what they are talking about? if creationists are talking from a position of knowledge then there should be a creationist discussion of gastralia, their relative position to the sternum, the ossification of the sternum, the presence of a carina, and so forth. the continued failure of creationists to respond with intelligent discussion demonstrates their ignorance of the topic. therefore, any creationist assertions of the status of archaeopteryx must be considered as unfounded.	one shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. that is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   in the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. why should creationists be any different? after all, they are people, too. but rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.	notsarc

well, since you're the only presenting that argument, i'm glad you recognize how stupid it is so we can drop it. prove that. give evidence. anything. you said that someone who claims harm without evidence is a bigot. show us your evidence or admit to being a bigot. and lest you make a foolish claim, allow me to point out that the fact that you personally don't like how something is changing does not mean that's it's been harmed. you'll have to do better than that.	now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is.	notsarc

i personally am astounded at the overreaction of the government in response to a handfull of shootings in no. sending in the army in full force, confiscating guns and talking about an 'insurgency' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns.on an average day in new york there are 10 times as many reports of shootings, yet i don't see such a massive military response over there...	well, if they've re-established control in new orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. if they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (i'm very pro-2nd amendment, so don't get me wrong here. i'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)i also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for not sending in the military. now people are criticizing them for doing it???	notsarc
by what standard of evidence does evolution science claim a direct evolutionary relationship with those hominids that preceded us such as java, peking and neanderthal man, is it based on chromosomal, amino acids, cytochrome c, genetics, dna, lifestyle, or simply based on their hominid/primate similarities? now if you come back with evidence that neanderthal buried their dead, and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man, then surely some chemical relationship has also been discovered since the advent of dna technology, whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarities/connections, or one of the other chemical relationships mentioned above.	but rather than be honest about your mistake, you just changed things without paying any attention to the fact that we've shown you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the claims of the scientific community.. at least, not until somebody tells you.

"it appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in texas back before the civil war, and texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say ""maybe, just maybe, the reason that many american people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it is."""	well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and not prejudice. the same can't be said for slavery. there are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. in fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. after all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had. 	notsarc

since only abstinence is 100% effective you are in effect suggesting that unless you're prepared to raise a child, don't have sex. a return to controlling women's sex lives through negative social pressure is the objective of the pro-life movement, not saving babies. if every pro-lifer was an adoptive parent i think they would have more credibility.	why should every pro-lifer have to be an adoptive parent in order to have credibility?this is akin to saying that every pro-choicer should have to have an abortion -- or at least face that choice personally -- in order to be a credible pro-choicer.	notsarc

"the thing is, though, that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without ""redefining the standard."" it is a way for us to allow all those oddball marriages without putting an ""official stamp of approval"" on them. liberals want to expand the government involvement in marriage to include gay marriages, thus putting society's approval on these things (something that gets moralists very angry.)conservatives want to continue the statist rewards for straight marriage only - a violation of the 14th amendment.libertarians combine the best of both positions. their position (privatization) creates the freedom to marry, upholds the constitution, and avoids official approval of gay marriage at the same time."	i think your idea has merit. however, before i would fully endorse it, i am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law.	notsarc

what bothers me the most about 'organized religion' is the sheer hypocracy. i was taught that god instructs us to question authority, yet 'the church' brainwashes it's mass followers to not ever question authority, especially theirs.  i was taught that to not utilize the brain i was given was the unspoken sin of all sins. yet organized religion forces it's followers to do just that, to not question authority, pooh-pooh science, and never think for themselves let alone following their hearts.  i cannot of good conciense as a parent allow my child to be subjected to that type of abuse. spiritual abuse, abuse of the soul. how dare anyone expect me to do that to an innocent child? how dare anyone allow this to continually happen, even encourage it's existence is beyond compassionate comprehension.  but the fact that it does isn't shocking, it's just sickening.	you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright.

"atheists do, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they represent science. you haven't gotten in over your head â€“ most who post here don't know much about science. tq doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that i don't. there's a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel ""intellectually fulfilled"", to discredit religion. some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn't written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. michael ruse and bradley monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. religious authors, practically too many to name. william dembski, david berlinski, phillip johnson, cornelius hunter, many others. you would do well to read anything by any of these people. far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like richard dawkins. he's become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. michael behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. read ""the edge of evolution"", or ""darwin's black box"" sometime. :)"	oh yes, mr behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. his newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. as for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.	sarc

the law applies equally to everyone. religious people cannot discriminate outside of a church, as the printer tried to do. bishop henry's comments were indeed hateful, not religious. there are laws against willful promotion of hatred. this type of speech has legal limits. this does not mean all hate speech will be illegal, only that there are limits. i suppose you thought his comments about the state using it's coersive power against gays, was very christian? would it not be more nazi?	oh come on. if those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. canada must have a lot of tax dollars. i don't entirely agree with what he said either, but i think it's downright scary that your govt. investigates something like that.	sarc
so you can learn why your characterizations of the facts, and the people presenting them, are horse dung.	why does they admin let ez post comments like this to other people, if he can't be vicl and debate like an adult to others, why is he here......to spread god's love ...right?	sarc
i know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.	all sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. or have you forgotten sodom and gomorrah? coming to a san francisco bath house near you.	sarc
not until i see verified proof of the validity of his original birth certificate and his health records...each without redaction. obama is a facade...an opaque facade...appearing to many to be an honest man. i say he is a liar...and always will be a liar.	do you seriously mean to suggest that the entire campaign, election, and inauguration would have taken place under the scrutiny of the world without this vital discovery being made? if so, it looks as though you and phelps both set bells to ringing when you pass by. the bells say, 'bong, bong, bong!!	sarc
ah yes the oldest con game in the world. set up the game so its impossible to comply with the rules, then use the guilt effect to control the test subject. the christians have managed to commercialize the whole concept on a mass scale. and even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on. in adams fall we sinned all. guilt is the father of ........ economic returns!	so i take it you don't accept my challenge on the basis that it is impossible? why is it impossible? or better yet, why don't we al just evolve into perfect, anti-sinning creatures with 500 iq points a piece?  	sarc
these mooks are legends in their own minds marc. yet in spite of their sanctimonious arrogance i actually feel sorry for them because of the massive fall which awaits them when the reality of their spiritual condition hits home on that final day. emoticonxcry emoticonxdonno	and yet we're still waiting for your mental condition to finally hit you like a ton of bricks.... denial is the usual reaction...	sarc
i did say that if birth control failed (condoms do sometimes too, i think their effectiveness is at like 97%, but that's not 100%) abortion should be acceptable. i know some people want to ban the morning-after pill, but i think most people agree that it should be ok, i know i do. the day of conception, there is virtually no argument that the fetus is actually a human life that takes priority over the mother's life, unless they get into a purely religious rant about how the moment of conception the fetus is a human life that deserves the same rights as anyone. anyway, i don't agree with that.	could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess.	notsarc
yes, we do. and the truth is a person, jesus christ (john 14:6).  has any major truth concerning jesus' life, death, or resurrection in the new testament ever been shown to have been substantially changed or proven wrong? no!  if you claim otherwise, prove it.  one other thing: when were the books of the new testament written? scholars give their expert opinions: dating the nt too bad you're so steeped in denial over christ that you can't see the forest for the trees. 1 john 2:22-23: 'who is the liar? it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ. such a man is the antichristhe denies the father and the son. no one who denies the son has the father; whoever acknowledges the son has the father also.' jesus is lord!	other than showing your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claims what was accomplished here? as for the date that the nt books were written, more importance could be given to those guesses if any still existed or if early christians could have refrained from changing the word of god. sorry current christians do it also so unfair to blame just the early ones.	sarc
well insults. no i'm not suprised i wish i could put my hands on the pol on firearms ownership that put the % of dems that owned guns was around 46%. rep. was around 58% and independants were around 52%. what i was supprised at was that way this person feels that the reason libs need to be armed is the defend them selves from a conservative government. where as we beleave it is to defend our selves against any and all forms of government. and for a lib to actualy say that they were wrong about anything is a big step.	i wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. until then i'll remain skeptical. let's remember that democrats and liberals hunt. remove that group and what's left? something less than 20% of americans that own only handguns.	notsarc
[i]you've lost this round time and time again. if you keep posting this nonsense then tither's gonna come around, point out the exhaustive studies that show there's no link between gun control and reduced levels of violence,	it is all repeated time after time, and time again then again. but you are correct. here is one of the links to those studies. emoticonxsmilie http://www.4forums.com/political/gun...tml#post354115but what do we do about this? http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcon...dennis_culhane which is a study of criminals shooting criminals but it is hoped that people will think it is about law abiding concealed carry. this is not representative of law-abiding concealed carry or legal gun ownership in any way. and we have this.guns and death - firearms research - harvard injury control research center - harvard school of public healthso lets look at the actual crime figures to see if any of this holds water.  according to this 1999 article  there were 250 million guns in circulation in 1999.   total nics background checks november 30, 1998 - june 30, 2009 	notsarc
i was educated in 12 years of catholic school plus 2 years at st josephs univ. in philly so i know my catechism...that is what is important to me..........	that's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's holy book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that jesus and his disciples said?  	sarc
we know. nato regurgitated the same talking point in post 3. do try to keep up.	do try to keep up with yourself. people like you are always talking about how we need gun control laws in response to the crimes taking place. but you have absolutely no answer for what to do when said laws are violated.	sarc
hyea- right - in england the speaker of the house isn't even allowed to speak... :p ... so-o-o? emoticonxrolleyes	oh but he/ she is. his often speaks out to remind our dear mps that they are supposed to be leaders of our country, not school kids a playground. he does this by yelling 'order!' a lot. and he gets to wear a silly wig i think (or is that 'black rod'?) (ps, wilted_laughter is irish i think. your post sort of implies you think him english. calling an irishman 'english' is a crime even more serious than calling someone a 'liberal' in the usa :p)	sarc
how do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years? and if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence? and while your at it, ask yourself if it's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust?	how about this explanation - you're reading waaaaay too much into your precious bible.	sarc
"that reminds me of the discussion i got into on a ""christian"" board when i referred to a particular pompous xxx as a pompous xxx. i was banned for a week for using profane language. pointing out that an xxx is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless. my answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the bible because they told of how abraham tied his xxx to a tree and jesus sat on his xxx in jerusalem. didn't phase them. they also ignored without comment references to judge roy moore's monumental erection in the rotunda of the alabama supreme court building."	that is what supersport is hoping to do... however, assuming that you are correct in your interpretation, he has no chance of doing it so well.	notsarc

there's more to the adoption of an atheistic stance than just rejecting the bible because it's scientifically false. 'the bible is scientific nonsense, therefore there is no god' is not a logical stance.	true, but i was referring to psychological explanations, not genuine reasons.	notsarc
"what you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality? the definitions were accurate. it would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation. how about some evidence to support the ""theory.""by the way, i'm still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed. what you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under ""evolution,"" wasn't it?"	wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions	notsarc

"... here is what is hard to understand about that; in matthew, 12:30, jesus says ""he who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters""."	"but miller is with jesus (and by extension, you): he says that god exists and that christianity is true. or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: you call miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. miller clearly continues with ""philosophical pronouncements"" that many atheists do not forward. over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond ""atheistic philosophical pronouncements."""	notsarc
something is only dumb to those that cannot comprehend. is a student dumb or the teacher too dumb to teach? one does not train a dog to sit, lay down, crawl, etc, the dog already knows how to do these things. what you do train a dog to do, respond to a command. in order for this to happen one must be smarter than the dog or at least of equal intelligence.  senseless you say. numbers don't matter. how about size? ask your partner.  what purpose does your life have? what is that thing that drives you? mine is to share what i have learned. no one share this with, no reason to move forward. a painter with no brush. passion lost and all else with it.	wow, you're clever. and some things are dumb. ex, choosing to die when you have the option to live. your lame analogies aside, (yeah, i used the word lame again) one can find new people to hang out with. and again, instead of answering my arguement, you decide to try and insult me. you're right, i must be the one who is dumb...	sarc
