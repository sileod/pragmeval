i think 30 min is reasonable.	unverifiable
i don't really know	unverifiable
seems not too complicated.	unverifiable
many airlines will also notify your cell email whatever if you have it in their frequent flier info.	non-experiential
that would also  be helpful	unverifiable
also many of us live 1-2 hours from major airports	non-experiential
and the info would be very helpful.	unverifiable
a flight is a flight.	non-experiential
the rule should apply to all.	unverifiable
i don't see the harm in banning at least the service of peanuts on the airlines.	unverifiable
the ban should include all peanut and peanut containing products.	unverifiable
recently we flew across the country and followed all of the procedures the airline gave us in turn they promised to clean seats and  create a buffer zone to sheild my 3 year old son from any peanut exposure.	experiential
as i walked to me seat expecting what i was promised i find left over peanuts in our seats!	experiential
i came prepared with wipes and medicine just in case.	experiential
the airline offered no assistance in fixing the problem.	experiential
after cleaning everything up and getting all settled in, i had to hold my son for the next 5 hours	experiential
because it was too risky.	unverifiable
at the onset of an attack the use of an epi-pen would give us about 20 minutes to be in a hospital.	non-experiential
during the snack a member of the flight crew pointed at us and told the other passengers that he could not offer them peanut mandms	experiential
because there was an allergy sufferer on board.	experiential
thankfully, after a dose of benadryl my son was fine.	experiential
i do think the passenger should come equipped with medication if case of exposure.	unverifiable
most severe allergy suffers carry medicine with them anyway.	non-experiential
it would not hurt for the airline to carry addition medication	unverifiable
because the epi-pen only allows 20 minutes to seek immediate medical attention.	non-experiential
i don't see the harm in banning at least the service of peanuts on the airlines.	unverifiable
the ban should include all peanut and peanut containing products.	unverifiable
i forgot to mention that i would not expect the airline to provide my son's medication!	unverifiable
currently southwest does not serve peanut products on their flights.	non-experiential
after this experience we only fly with southwest!	experiential
tell the truth immediately, boys,	unverifiable
and treat passengers like valued human beings.	unverifiable
that's it.	unverifiable
southwest does it,	unverifiable
and they have the most loyal passengers in the industry.	unverifiable
it can be done, if you have the will to do it.	unverifiable
the price sw shows online is the real price, not a teaser fare that shoots up rapidly when the taxes, fees, surcharges, etc. are added.	non-experiential
sw does not charge me nuisance fees .	non-experiential
if they can do it, so can the rest of you.	unverifiable
i just wish bwi were closer to the northern va location i frequent,	unverifiable
so i could use sw all the time.	experiential
i fly at least once every week, usually between columbus, oh and the dc area.	experiential
during the past year the sunday night delays on usair , united , and even sw  in that order have been abismal, with delays at least 30-50% of the time.	non-experiential
when cancellations were made, passengers weren't told until 5-10 minutes before departure.	experiential
these have mostly been mechanical problems , crew shortages, and non-severe weather.	experiential
efficient, effective management would prevent the vast majority of these problems.	unverifiable
on sunday, june 13 i was scheduled on us3234 dca-cmh at 4:55 pm.	experiential
when i arrived at the gate the plane and crew were there.	experiential
at about 10 min. before boarding time the gate agent said they'd made a minor repair to the plane,	experiential
this went on until after 7 pm, at which time i re-booked for the next morning and went home.	experiential
the plane did eventually fly, 3 hours late,	experiential
but meanwhile i've wasted 5 hours sitting at an overheated, overcrowded, hopelessly noisy national airport	experiential
because usair can't get paperwork faxed from brazil.	non-experiential
they are bound to occur.	unverifiable
plan for it and head off these problems.	unverifiable
during last winter's blizzards in the east, sw was the only airline that told the truth and notified us many hours in advance that flights were cancelled.	experiential
united and usair constantly insisted the flights were going, when in fact they were not.	experiential
if the carriers want the privilege of using our air space and our public airports , they should be held to this standard.	unverifiable
tell the truth as soon as you know it, and fix the problem promptly if it's anything other than severe weather that is truly beyond your control.	unverifiable
i strongly support any provision that would provide air travelers with additional timely information regarding flight delays.	unverifiable
in many cases a traveler may need to make other plans to reach his or her destination,	non-experiential
and the lack of information regarding flight delays may limit his or her ability to do so.	non-experiential
dot should require that when a fare or rate can only be achieved if two persons book that both the one person rate be displayed or provided unless it is clear that the person booking is booking for two.	unverifiable
dot should not adopt a less strict approach to post-purchase price increases.	unverifiable
if i buy a tv at best buy, best buy cannot come after me later to wring more money out of me.	non-experiential
a traveler enters into a contract with an airline whereby the traveler pays a price so that the airline with transport the person somewhere on an agreed-upon date and time.	non-experiential
when the airline later changes the price, it is effectively breaking the contract and extorting money out of the traveler who likely will lose more money it he or she objects.	non-experiential
given the fact that travelers contract for airline travel at different times or dates between the time the airline posts the flight and the date of travel, and people already know that prices can change if they do not buy a ticket, the airline can raise ticket prices on seats purchased later.	non-experiential
further, the airline likely will include possible fuel price fluctuations in their calculation of ticket fares or prices.	non-experiential
regarding ticket prices, i believe airlines should be required to publish a comparable, typical fare regardless of how they otherwise choose to display their pricing structure.	unverifiable
for instance, all airlines should be required to publish the price, fee and tax inclusive, to fly round-trip with one checked bag to the destination.	unverifiable
this would allow travelers to compare prices between carriers	non-experiential
because the price would be for the same thing.	non-experiential
to the extent other services could be provided , that could be displayed separately as an opt-in.	unverifiable
the biggest issue i have as a traveler with the various prices and airline price structures is that there is no comparability.	unverifiable
while i think i may be getting a good deal with one carrier,	unverifiable
there always seems to be some other amount i later must pay	non-experiential
that, were it figured into the mix when i made the decision of which carrier to fly with, could have caused me to choose a different carrier.	unverifiable
any foreign carrier that operates in the u.s. should be subject to u.s. rules with respect to u.s. flights.	unverifiable
those carriers are making money off u.s. travelers,	non-experiential
consequently they should be required to follow the rules here.	unverifiable
first, i have my fair share of allergies and have spent a fair share of time in the er, with allergic reactions.	experiential
as a parent, i understand the pain that some of the parents have related in their stories.	unverifiable
we, the ones with allergies are very few and far between, when we consider the flying public.	non-experiential
i have my share of epi-pens, in the event one is needed or prednisone, should i have a case of anaphylaxis.	experiential
"as they say in the bsa, ""be prepared."""	unverifiable
i guess i am fortunate	unverifiable
since my symptomology is always similar in nature and covers a four to 12 hour period:  itchy skin, itchy scalp, swelling of joints, poor demeanor, then hives and off to the er if an anti-anaphylaxis drug isn't in use by the time hives break out,	experiential
which is usually 4 hours after the first symptoms start to manifest themselves or the scalp becomes itchy.	experiential
"if this is a case where people, with these allergies are deemed ""handicapped, these people should have their medication on their person, to mitigate anaphylaxis."	unverifiable
i do.	experiential
after the medication is ingested or injected, relief comes in less than five minutes	non-experiential
and the only discomfort i have had is a case of the sweats and  or  or a minor headache.	unverifiable
when peanuts are served, they come individually wrapped	non-experiential
and it is the responsibility of the passenger to dispose of the wrapper, accordingly.	unverifiable
i regret to say that although pretzels have been offered as an alternative, they aren't a substitute for peanuts.	unverifiable
also, i have been advised that cashews are edible by people with peanut allergies and could be used as a substitute.	non-experiential
since medication is portable ,	non-experiential
i believe that a warning that peanuts are being used is sufficent and that flight attendents be trained in the usage of epi-pens for this purpose.	unverifiable
when airlines are forced to limit the types of food it can serve, esecially when less than 1% of the flying public it serves, it impacts price, quality of service and capitulates to the will of the very small minority,	non-experiential
in which there is a ready solution that is present.	non-experiential
"i say ""no"" to such a food rule and would encourage all passengers and parents to execise a little responsibility and be pro-active in the introduction of the appropriate medication, when necessary."	unverifiable
note: a long time ago, to be a flight attendent, one also had to be a registered nurse.	non-experiential
there is no comparison.	unverifiable
tobacco smoke, unlike peanuts, not only affects everybody, it also affects the hvac and electronics  or  avionics, on-board an aircraft.	non-experiential
"anybody who had done a ""c"" or ""d"" check aboard aircraft in the 70's and 80's can tell the difference, especially with the tobacco gunk on the wires and avionics."	unverifiable
"peanuts does not have same health risks ""to innocent passengers, as tobacco smoke."	non-experiential
this becomes especially true if there is knowledge and forewarning that the affected passenger assumes that peanuts are going to be served and efforts to mitigate the situation are employed.	non-experiential
while i support the dot's effort to make sure the fees are published upfront,	unverifiable
i do think there need to be limits on some fees, chief among them carry on luggage.	unverifiable
if the airlines are charging for checked baggage, there need to be rules preventing them from charging for carry ons.	unverifiable
it is not acceptable for airlines to have what is in effect a mandatory fee for carrying any luggage at all on a vacation.	unverifiable
luggage is not something that very many air travelers can cut out altogether,	unverifiable
the dot should step in and prevent them from charging fees on all of it.	unverifiable
in relation to mthornt1's point, the overhead bins are not the only place to put luggage.	non-experiential
there is room under the seats that is designed for luggage as well.	non-experiential
if airlines have restrictions on carryons, it's up to them to determine how much they want to enforce them.	unverifiable
reading most of the comments it seems that the biggest concern is peanut allergy sufferers inhaling peanut particles.	unverifiable
perhaps instead of banning peanuts and peanut products outright.	unverifiable
airlines and the dot can provide sufferers with hepa airmasks	non-experiential
which i assume will prevent individuals from inhaling peanut dust.	unverifiable
i would think this approach would be of minimal cost  and would not require a ban. if touch is a problem dressing accordingly can help decrease the amount.	unverifiable
i would say that if someone still insists upon a ban if these measures would work that we are then getting into a debate of my rights over your rights and my want to be comfortable compared to your want to be comfortable which definitely takes us out of the need to protect life arena	unverifiable
i think the government should do studies if they insist upon a ban and should not put one into effect without such a study.	unverifiable
i think the dot should prove that peanuts on planes will cause the problems that other commenters are concerned about.	unverifiable
controlled studies demonstrating that peanuts eaten in one portion of an airplane will be sent through the air into other portions.	non-experiential
studies that can show that there is enough residue left from others eating peanuts to trigger reactions.	non-experiential
although anecdotal evidence is helpful	unverifiable
and i do not doubt the veracity of the claims made by others	unverifiable
i think facts and statistics need to be considered.	unverifiable
perhaps some concerns such as air circulation can be alleviated.	unverifiable
then creating a buffer zone would make more sense.	unverifiable
the problem is that when such a subject comes up everyone uses emotion to make a decision and decisions of this nature should also be made with considering scientific facts.	unverifiable
i am concerned that any solution will lull travelers with peanut allergies into a false sense of security.	unverifiable
it may prevent the airline itself from serving peanuts,	unverifiable
i do not suffer peanut allergies,	experiential
nor do i know anyone who has them .	unverifiable
i do realize though that there is a growing trend of more and more americans being allergic to peanuts.	non-experiential
i'm not sure why.	unverifiable
personally, i suspect it's something in the environment -- maybe chemicals in our food , plastics, etc.	unverifiable
who knows.	unverifiable
but it does appear that the allergies are on the increase --	non-experiential
and something is causing it.	non-experiential
i'm not sure how realistic bans on peanuts really are -- especially in environments like airplanes.	unverifiable
these bans make sense in day care and schools where parents and kids can be educated about the issues, and the same consumers  return to the same location every day.	unverifiable
however, with air travel, it's really more about educating the entire american public about the dangers of peanuts to remedy the situation...	unverifiable
there seem to be more important medical issues taking more lives that should be higher on the overall public agenda.	unverifiable
"ricport - ""total responsibility"" is only possible when you have control."	unverifiable
when you have both feet on the ground, you can drop everything and get to emergency services within 20 minutes.	non-experiential
adequate preparation = reducing possibility of exposure and carrying epipens just in case -	unverifiable
but they only buy you 20minutes or so	non-experiential
and limit is 2 without medical supervision.	non-experiential
so, small-minded pax eating peanuts at 30,000 feet and unsympathetic crew could = death.	unverifiable
and as for nannying, my experience is that government treats people according to the way they're acting.	unverifiable
it's a question of degree to which the allergic traveler  can reasonably manage the risks.	unverifiable
when in the terminal , exposure can be managed or avoided and if anything happnes, emergency services are a 911 call away and the ambulance can get you to a hospital before the epipen wear off.	unverifiable
when in an aircraft, the traveler is confined	non-experiential
and if anything happens, the epipens still buy you 20 minutes	non-experiential
but you're no closer to a hospital.	non-experiential
while i am no expert,	experiential
i believe that a variety of simulations could empirically address this issue.	unverifiable
one would need to determine the required concentration of airborne particles to spark an allergic reaction in the most medically sensitive individual - thereby setting the threshold level of airborne peanut particulate.	unverifiable
that said, as other commenters have noted, airborne peanut particulate is not the sole cause of an allergic reaction.	non-experiential
i do, however, take issue with the phrasing of this question.	unverifiable
clearly, the genesis of the question is that allergic reactions to peanuts can be fatal.	unverifiable
the question should address *potentially fatal* allergic reactions.	unverifiable
"if the danger being addressed is any and all allergic peanut reaction, the answer is ""none."""	unverifiable
if the danger being addressed is a *potentially fatal* allergic reaction, airlines should stop serving peanuts and contributing to a potentially dangerous environment.	unverifiable
however, an outright restriction on what passengers may be permitted to bring on board is excessive and, potentially, unenforceable.	unverifiable
transportation security challenges are already too great to include enforcement of a ban on all peanut products.	unverifiable
furthermore, it is unreasonable to assume that the average citizen is fully aware of the peanut content  of their snack items.	unverifiable
no all-out ban will fully eliminate a potentially fatal environment, and dot should not encourage such a false sense of security to those travelers who might be concerned about this matter.	unverifiable
if the study outlined in my first response yielded a reasonable ppm threshold of peanut particulate, dot could work with airlines and airliner manufacturers to install the appropriate systems that would alert passengers to the risk as well as neutralize that risk.	unverifiable
i cannot answer the first part.	unverifiable
as for the second part, airlines already carry portable defibrilators.	non-experiential
carrying epipens would not be an undue burden.	unverifiable
airlines, however, should expect that passengers or parents would carry their own epipens.	unverifiable
airlines should not be expected to administer epipen treatments to unaccompanied children, and children with such allergies should not be permitted to fly unaccompanied.	unverifiable
airlines should not contribute to an environment that endangers their passengers.	unverifiable
however, passenger choices should not be restricted, if reasonable assurance can be given that passenger food or snack choices do not contribute to a potentially fatal environment.	unverifiable
it is true that the quality of delay information is not always within the airline's control.	non-experiential
"often, when the faa institutes the practice of ""metering"" due to weather or high volume, the airline really can't advise the customers of the reason for a delay."	unverifiable
in fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the faa figures out how to route traffic.	non-experiential
furthermore, having listened to ground control or tower communications on united flights, it's clear that the controllers can give an estimated delay,	unverifiable
but that delay is subject to change.	non-experiential
again, the airline's information is only as good as the faa's information - and, well, the situation is fluid.	unverifiable
to that end, dot's rule must consider that faa's traffic management practices and procedures might necessarily inhibit airlines' ability to comply with such regulations.	unverifiable
southwest says they apply 100% to a new ticket	non-experiential
but there always seems to be a price increase or that price ticket is not available or some other excuse so that you always have to pay more.	non-experiential
also the ticket expires in one year,	non-experiential
so you fly or you lose it.	non-experiential
i proposed an answer to overbooking in another area.	unverifiable
the airlines know how many seats they have on a flight and how many tickets they have sold for the flight.	non-experiential
each passenger should be guaranteed a seat up to the number of seats on the flight,	unverifiable
after that passengers should be sold standby seats numbered 1-n, first come, first served.	unverifiable
this is neat and simple and there is no question of who gets a seat if they show up.	unverifiable
southwest has a pretty good business model;	unverifiable
they are cheerful and friendly and accommodating.	unverifiable
and their fares are still mostly bundled.	non-experiential
when the airlines changed their business model they reduced service and increased fares, they just claimed they were trying to be fairer to the customers.	non-experiential
and they definitely don't have a cheerful, friendly, accommodating business atmosphere.	unverifiable
i predict that airlines are hastening their own demise when they engage in their anti customer and certainly unethical behavior.	unverifiable
"transferability and any other ""change"" type fees are for revenue production only and not for services rendered."	unverifiable
they already are using our money for free sometimes for months in advance.	unverifiable
most of us make changes online at negligible or no cost to the airline.	non-experiential
for those who call a real person there is already  a service fee for that as well so they are really double dipping.	unverifiable
and then there's the effect of all the extra carry-ons on the cabin crew:	non-experiential
they all seem to settle into the $15-$35 each way.	non-experiential
the airlines aren't competing on price for checked baggage.	non-experiential
i think the best solution is $0.	unverifiable
as the mother of a child with a life threatening peanut allergy	experiential
i have had to consider this issue carefully.	unverifiable
i am also a physician.	experiential
we carry 4 epi pens and benadryl, wipe everything down, and bring his own food.	experiential
fortunately we have not had a problem,	experiential
but i also will not fly with him on delta	unverifiable
since they serve peanuts to the whole plane.	non-experiential
having flown without him on delta, the smell of peanuts being opened by 150 people at the same time was enough to convince me we'd have a problem.	unverifiable
i don't expect airlines to regulate what foods people bring on a plane,	unverifiable
but i don't understand why everyone has to be handed a bag of peanuts that they will open and spread the dust throughout the plane.	unverifiable
i know its up to me to be prepared	unverifiable
epinephrine wears off quickly,	unverifiable
so even treating someone appropriately doesn't cure a reaction	unverifiable
and definitive treatment is necessary.	unverifiable
i'll continue to avoid delta when traveling with my son and continue to be prepared while on other airlines,	unverifiable
but it would be so much simpler if the airline didn't hand out  a life threatening substance that people can do without for the short duration of a flight.	unverifiable
as an air traveler and peanut-allergy sufferer,	experiential
i flew in february and march	experiential
because of the severity of my life-long allergy,	experiential
both times i hoped that the passengers i sat near would choose pretzels instead of peanuts.	unverifiable
what would be helpful to a passenger such as myself, would be banning the service only when a passenger requests it ahead of time or requiring a peanut-free buffer zone.	unverifiable
it seems that other passengers would be less disturbed if other  snack options were provided on flights where a person has a medically-documented severe allergy, instead of relegating some people to sit in a peanut-free buffer zone.	unverifiable
it can be very likely that a passenger with a severe allergy would need an epinephrine auto-injector.	non-experiential
often the allergic actions do not warrant the news media.	non-experiential
most of the time it happens to me, i'm focused on staying alive.	unverifiable
i can only speak from my own reactions:	unverifiable
yes, i can get that sick from the air particles in an airplane.	experiential
while i may prepare myself for being stuck in an airplane with peanuts, it would be nice to trust that my fellow passengers don't mind eating pretzels in exchange for me not having to seek medical attention.	unverifiable
absolutely agree with requiring that all commercial aircraft be required to comply with the dot-proposed tarmac delay rules.	unverifiable
since the main problems that airlines feared have not been shown to be valid in the year since implementation	non-experiential
moving forward with a comprehensive plan is responsible and desirable.	unverifiable
the 3 hour limit is perhaps reasonable if and only if, sanitation facilities, food and water, and cabin temperature and air quality can be rigorously maintained at regulated  levels for the duration of the wait and the subsequent flight time.	unverifiable
the idea of deplaning and segregating passengers is workable - as are all of the other points, if advance planning  is performed and red-teamed to ensure general applicability of solutions.	unverifiable
as new airports and aircraft are built, or as renovations are undertaken, the processes identified as important to achieve in during the planning process can be considered and worked more seamlessly into future designs.	unverifiable
notifications should be required when a situation changes - if people are at some point allowed to deplane - they should be notified of their rights and responsibilities, just as they are when they are when they are no longer allowed to move around in the aircraft.	unverifiable
this will make the situation clear to both passengers and to airline personnel.	unverifiable
any longer time period should be unacceptable except in the most extreme circumstances - and the requirements to maintain passenger comfort should not be relaxed.	unverifiable
a shorter delay time might be considered at very small airports and for very small aircraft such and the crjs and other commuter aircraft.	unverifiable
if you have a problem, it is up to you to have the solution.	unverifiable
"i say ""if"" because the vast majority of supposed food allergies are bs - the paranoid imaginings of overly anxious parents."	unverifiable
didn't think so.	unverifiable
keep you hands off my peanuts!	unverifiable
peanuts happen to be one of the most nutritious and filling snacks available pound for pound,	unverifiable
and peanut products are often the only thing that picky kids will eat.	unverifiable
i say again - if you are really allergic, stay home.	unverifiable
if i've paid for a ticket on a given flight, either put me on that flight or give me adequate compensation, like food, drink and a hotel room if needed, until you can get me where i paid you to take me.	unverifiable
as for weather delays, that is part of the business.	unverifiable
i've registered my son on a flight as peanut-allergic and had the attendant try to hand him a bag of peanuts.	experiential
flight personnel need more education on this.	unverifiable
ricport: i don't see the supporters shirking responsibility.	unverifiable
i see them saying that even when they do everything they can, it's not enough to stay alive.	unverifiable
not when on a flight without hospital access.	unverifiable
please be specific in areas that you are seeing within this discussion that show lack of responsibility on behalf of supporters.	unverifiable
i am the mom of a child with allergies to peanuts  and have flown six times  with my child and had no problems, though some anxiety.	experiential
delta's policy is to create a peanut-free buffer three rows in front and three rows behind the peanut-allergic person.	experiential
one flight happened to be peanut-free	experiential
because there were several passengers on the flight with peanut allergies,	experiential
and the buffer zones pretty much took up the entire plane.	unverifiable
the other flights were not peanut-free.	experiential
as mentioned by someone previously, banning peanuts is a slippery slope	unverifiable
because there are many people with life-threatening allergies to many foods.	non-experiential
shellfish allergies are more common in adults than peanuts.	non-experiential
"someone wrote above ""as for the 'slippery slope' argument - i don't buy it."""	non-experiential
i've never heard of anyone having a wheat allergy going into anaphylaxis from someone sitting next to them eating a sandwich.	experiential
interesting point,	unverifiable
but i can turn it around	unverifiable
as i have never heard of a documented case of anyone going into anaphylaxis from airborne contact of peanuts.	experiential
from what i understand, airborne anaphylaxis is very rare.	non-experiential
if anything, i would suggest a ban on warming up peanuts,	unverifiable
since that is more likely to put peanut proteins in the air.	non-experiential
i would also suggest training staff to be sensitive to passengers with allergies.	unverifiable
they should create allergy policies and post them in an easily findable place on their websites  and be consistent so a passenger doesn't think she is flying on a nut-free flight when it isn't.	unverifiable
and while this forum is great,	unverifiable
i would weigh more the advice of researchers.	unverifiable
many people react emotionally regarding this issue	unverifiable
and when dot considers options, it should take into consideration what scientific studies have shown have occurred or may occur, not what well-intentioned people or panicked people think may occur.	unverifiable
epinephrine should always be the responsibility of the passenger,	unverifiable
though it may be good policy to have extra on board in the event of an anaphylaxis .	unverifiable
a passenger's bill or rights or  responsibilities would be helpful.	unverifiable
e.g. encourage people with allergies to carry two or more self-injectors;	unverifiable
giving people with food allergies -- anyone with a medical condition actually--  the option to board the plane early.	unverifiable
1 unless you can purchase the one way fare and ultimately find  seating, i think any offer requiring round trip should be disclosed as such.	unverifiable
this goes for hotel and or or air and packages.	unverifiable
2 no increase of prices after the purchase unless the customer agrees prior to the transaction without any additional inducement.	unverifiable
3  these changes would benefit the customers and place no additional burden on the sellers.	unverifiable
all the gotchas in small print in the advertising costs more then the changes  needed to make the site cleaner, leaner and fairer.	unverifiable
i believe that optional fees, non-optional fees and any and all fees period should be prominently accessible on the page that travelers are completing to purchase their tickets.	unverifiable
differences in code-share fees should not be allowed.	unverifiable
if they can share codes they can bloody well share the same fees.	unverifiable
the dot should require a second full fare price to include all traditionally provided services and baggage fees.	unverifiable
dot should put a six  month rule for displaying changes on baggage fees.	unverifiable
all carriers regardless of size of aircraft should be impacted.	unverifiable
dot should set the fees based on the ticketing airline and require the code-share to charge the same unless their charge benefits the traveler.	unverifiable
airlines are private companies and should not be micro-managed.	unverifiable
the regulations should address such subjects as safety and not subjects of compensation to customers for inconvenience.	unverifiable
consider that any extra expenses airlines will be facing with new regulations will be paid by customers.	unverifiable
look at it as forcing customers to pay for air travel insurance that covers any delays and other events that airlines can not control.	unverifiable
customers will be paying high premium for such insurance and will not be able to decline it	unverifiable
how similar to mandatory health insurance! .	unverifiable
most customers if given choice prefer to travel at lower cost rather than having additional travel interruption insurance.	non-experiential
if the vast majority of travelers are paying for baggage, then it is reasonable to say that traveling with baggage is a normal activity.	unverifiable
therefore the price of the fare should reflect that.	unverifiable
i understand the appeal of making flights look cheaper, and even the option to fly for a cheaper fare if you can travel light.	unverifiable
"however, i think that the option to see a ""full fare"" price is a very good idea."	unverifiable
"i feel that it should include all ""traditional"" services."	unverifiable
the flight, seat, baggage, overhead space, bathrooms, fuel, and fees.	unverifiable
i think we have grown accustomed to airlines charging for snacks	unverifiable
and it is not fair to expect them to feed and entertain passengers.	unverifiable
just get us, and our things, from point a to point b safely	unverifiable
i think it would be great to have all airlines post their optional-fee info to their site and one aggregate site.	unverifiable
i don't believe that the code share partners should be allowed to charge a different rate.	unverifiable
if you are flying as a representative of the first airline, or accepting reservations as a representative of the first airline, you should accept their fee structure.	unverifiable
since weight seems to be the issue with charging extra fees for checked luggage, the 98 lb person should pay less for a ticket than the 250 pounder.	unverifiable
i have thought that from the very beginning when the airlines introduced this new fee.	unverifiable
i just want to chime in and say how there needs to be more regulation in how carry-on baggage is handled on the plane.	unverifiable
so if my ginormous bag didn't physically fit into my personal overhead bin, then i can't stuff it into your space.	unverifiable
i think that was the thinking with the current system,	unverifiable
but now people are rushing to get onto the plane so they can get an overhead bin space so they don't have to put things under the seat in front of them, without care that they are infringing on everyone else's overhead space.	unverifiable
if there was a one free checked bag allowance, that would be helpful.	unverifiable
but ultimately, i would love to have seat-specific overhead space.	unverifiable
i realize that doesn't exactly fit into this category,	unverifiable
except i suppose it does support the one-checked-bag-free idea.	unverifiable
there needs to be more regulation in either 1 larger seat sizes, or 2 mandating that severely overweight passengers buy a second ticket.	unverifiable
it is very troubling to be seated next to a person who is taking more than their seat allows.	unverifiable
i'm not sure how they are enforcing it now,	unverifiable
but i've seen some really large people squeezed into their  seats.	unverifiable
it's not fair to have to share my already tiny seat with someone else.	unverifiable
pretty sure your kid will be fine.	unverifiable
if not, don't fly!!!	unverifiable
your vomiting was not an allergic reaction -	unverifiable
you were probably airsick.	unverifiable
allergies are not genetic,	non-experiential
so it is pretty much impossible that you and two of your offspring suffer from them.	unverifiable
this is clearly a case of you getting some bad information and believing the worst.	unverifiable
please let your kids get tested out by a real doctor ,	unverifiable
before you deprive them of any more of the enjoyable things in life.	unverifiable
as allergies are not genetic,	non-experiential
it is extremely unlikely  that you and you child have the same allergy.	unverifiable
also, while unpleasant, your child's reaction was not life threatening.	unverifiable
many children have these mild reactions to various foods - my daughter used to get a rash if she ate strawberries.	unverifiable
the sensitivity fades, usually by age 4.	unverifiable
the key is not to freak out about it.	unverifiable
i bet you are the same mom who rushes to the emergency room for every bump and bruise too.	unverifiable
the perception of an increase in severe allergies is just that - a perception.	unverifiable
this generation of parents just can't seem to let their kids grow up normally - which includes a few bumps, bruises, hives, etc.	unverifiable
peanuts are not going to kill anyone.	unverifiable
they should not be banned.	unverifiable
i think there need to be rules regarding airlines changing flights that passengers have already bought.	unverifiable
we have had airlines change our flights many times	experiential
and it always ends up with a big hassle and us being upset.	experiential
the last time we booked a flight from orlando to ca at thanksgiving with a layover in texas.	experiential
the airline decided to cancel the route through texas and rebooked on a flight through boston.	experiential
we were traveling with small children and specifically chose the flight through texas	experiential
because it is shorter and avoided bad weather.	unverifiable
when i called to resolve the issue, there was no offer of a refund at all.	experiential
the best she could do was send me through jfk instead.	experiential
when my husband called the next day she said they couldn't offer a refund because i had already made a change.	experiential
the refund was never offered to me	experiential
or i would have taken it.	unverifiable
a refund should be automatic when the airline changes your flight on you.	unverifiable
aggregate sites, local and online travel agencies, codeshare partner websites should all have access to this information.	unverifiable
this information should be public like published fares.	unverifiable
baggage is normally carried by passengers.	non-experiential
its transport should be part of the advertised price.	unverifiable
methods for pricing and advertising are inconsistent for both air carriers and third-party sellers, resulting in confusion for consumers that borders on fraud.	non-experiential
fees and surcharges paid to the airline can be misrepresented as government imposed taxes and surcharges.	non-experiential
the following consumer protections should be imposed:	unverifiable
* final airfare cost should be fully disclosed in all advertising and sales.	unverifiable
* fuel and other surcharges paid to an airline should not be misrepresented to the consumer as government-imposed taxes and fees.	unverifiable
* baggage and all required additional travel costs should be fully disclosed and paid for by the consumer at the time of purchase .	unverifiable
the dot proposal is very good but is not strict enough to provide adequate and necessary consumer protection.	unverifiable
i question the safety of so many carry-on bags shoved into the overhead compartments.	unverifiable
these compartments have been known to fly open during turbulence and items can easily fall out.	non-experiential
all fees should be listed out for each airline so consumers are given full access to fees in order to make informed decisions.	unverifiable
a 3-month period for displaying information is adequate.	unverifiable
it should be displayed on airline websites and ticketing outlets , at a minimum.	unverifiable
this should apply to all carriers doing business in the us for all size planes.	unverifiable
i think it should apply to all foreign and us airlines with flights to and from the us equally.	unverifiable
citizens should be protected regardless of which airline they choose	unverifiable
and airlines that operate in the us should be required to operate under equal rules.	unverifiable
i have a son w or  life threatening food allergies.	experiential
i believe all nut products should be ban, especially peanuts.	unverifiable
i have flown w or  my son on several occasions	experiential
and i have called the airline when purchasing tickets, a month ahead and a day before to make sure it would be a peanut free flight.	experiential
on 2 occasions they have still served peanuts or peanut butter.	experiential
this is very upsetting,	unverifiable
my son also has asthma	experiential
which makes his allergies that much worse.	unverifiable
a buffer zone in my opinion is not a option	unverifiable
because the air circulates around the whole plane.	non-experiential
one time we refused to get on the plane until the peanuts and peanut butter were removed,	experiential
which caused the flight to be delayed.	experiential
i don't understand how smoking can be banned on flights when people are physically addicted and no one complains.	unverifiable
ask people to refrain from eating peanuts or peanut products	unverifiable
and everyone is put out acting like there rights are being taken away,	unverifiable
when it can put other passengers lives at risk.	non-experiential
we only fly when we absolutely have to,	non-experiential
its just to scary.	unverifiable
as someone that once logged 100and flights per year for many years,	experiential
i have experienced both the best and the worst of what air travel can provide.	unverifiable
from a passenger perspective, i believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:	unverifiable
* there is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents;	non-experiential
* there is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger ;	non-experiential
* and there is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.	non-experiential
as a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.	non-experiential
i believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:	unverifiable
this winter, i had a vacation booked to colorado to ski.	experiential
on the day of travel there was heavy snow in new york city.	experiential
to me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.	unverifiable
however, despite repeated calls to the airline, i was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time .	experiential
however, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, i would face a steep re-booking expense , i went to the airport regardless .	experiential
upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed,	unverifiable
the flight had been canceled,	experiential
and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.	experiential
i then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.	experiential
the monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.	experiential
none of which was claimable or reimbursable.	experiential
* airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate;	unverifiable
"* in addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly , there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""airport health"" on the day of travel."	unverifiable
for example, just letting a passenger know about his or her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.	unverifiable
if that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:	unverifiable
he or she is already on the way to the airport.	non-experiential
"however, if an earlier communication were:  ""due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  please prepare for delays or possibility of cancellation.  we will provide another status update in one hour.""  this is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his or her planning."	unverifiable
* finally, rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.	unverifiable
perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.	unverifiable
sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.	non-experiential
i believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.	unverifiable
"such notifications are ""nice"" for relatively short delays ."	unverifiable
often however they don;t know how long a flight will be delayed if it is a mechanical issue or if thunderstorms have caused a back up of landing or take-off traffic.	unverifiable
"the problem becomes more of ""in which situations is a notice required"" vice how long or early should they notify people."	unverifiable
that isn't addressed here.	unverifiable
bottom line, i think this idea needs a lot more consideration and thought before going forward.	unverifiable
accurate fare disclosures will be very difficult.	unverifiable
airline fares are subject to routing restrictions, or, basically a list of acceptable cities through which connecting flights can be taken when necessary.	non-experiential
taxes and fees can vary depending on the connecting city being used	non-experiential
which makes full disclosure dependent on knowing the route the fare takes, and whether or not seats are available for any given day.	unverifiable
keep in mind that advertised prices are very often not available for all flights.	non-experiential
they are subject to availability.	non-experiential
"one huge source of irritation are ""surcharges""."	unverifiable
they can be zero or as high as $300 round trip, possibly more.	non-experiential
these seem never to be disclosed with any clarity,	unverifiable
but in conjunction with other taxes and fees can cause the real price to be nearly double the advertised price.	unverifiable
admittedly, full disclosure would be ideal.	unverifiable
but, the tax and fee structure used would require revamping first in order to have adequate consistency to be able to publish a fare with a degree of accuracy.	non-experiential
i have two children with severe peanut allergies,	experiential
and as it turns out i myself also suffer from peanut allergies.	experiential
i didn't know why i was getting sick for so many years without reason.	unverifiable
we have had several unfortunate situations while traveling	unverifiable
1 my then 4 year old son having an anaphylactic shock on an overseas flight	experiential
although we did avoid nuts and peanuts	experiential
"but another passenger consumed a product labeled ""may contain peanuts"" next to us."	experiential
2 i have myself been severely sick on an overseas flight from us to europe - vomiting on the entire flight due to peanut exposure in the lounge.	experiential
3 we have several times had issues with airlines not caring about the allergies.	experiential
one continental flight attendant once insisted on that it was a rule that she had to serve peanuts to us and everyone around us -	experiential
even though we had informed them before hand that we had peanut allergies.	experiential
i believe continental since has stopped serving peanuts,	non-experiential
but it was very unpleasant	unverifiable
and we had to give benadryl to our then 2 year old as he started wheezing -	experiential
it was not until he was wheezing that the flight attendant was kind enough to inform the captain and take back the peanuts!	experiential
4 the peanut buffer zones just don't work.	unverifiable
i don't know how many times we have notified the airlines and yet not once have been allowed pre-boarding to wipe down the area, been condenscended at the gate or by the stewardesses -	unverifiable
this is no matter if we fly first or economy.	unverifiable
they still seat people with their own food next to us	experiential
and they refuse helping us by asking these people not to eat peanut products - to the extend that we even experienced on aa last year that a lady sat next to us and insisted on eating her pbj sandwiches in spite that we were 3 people with peanut allergies next to her.	experiential
she didn't care	unverifiable
and the stewardess didn't care.	unverifiable
when we asked her to help us she wouldn't let us reseat somewhere else,	experiential
she wouldn't ask the lady to eat something else	experiential
even though we offered to buy her anything	experiential
and she wouldn't ask the woman to move.	experiential
she was rude and yelled that it was our problem and if our kids are so allergic we shouldn't bring them into public.	unverifiable
her colleague said that people with peanut allergies should hire a private jet	experiential
yet it is not all of us that would ever be able to travel if we have to do this.	non-experiential
our oldest boy ended up getting sick	experiential
and it wasn't until then that the one of the stewardesses apologized	experiential
but they still refused doing anything.	experiential
they wouldn't even notify the captain of the anaphylactic shock	experiential
because then everyone would get delayed.....	experiential
and the stewardess said the flight was delayed enough as is.	experiential
so she chose to risk our sons life.	unverifiable
this happened on aug 22, 2009 with aa from dfw to ewr.	experiential
5 the biggest problem is truly that so many people doesn't understand how serious and dangerous peanut exposure can be to a person with peanut allergies.	unverifiable
even people who understands it behaves irradic when it comes to treating people with peanut allergies decently.	unverifiable
we did complain	experiential
and the airline did apologize	experiential
but it still shows how people not caring are the biggest threat.	unverifiable
the easiest way to ensure everyones safety  is really just to ban peanuts and peanut products on flights.	unverifiable
it is not that anyone will die having to go without for a flight	unverifiable
but some people may die or get seriously sick if they are not.	unverifiable
i recall the time when passengers were allowed to smoke on the flights -	experiential
this is not allowed any longer for safety.	non-experiential
although no one will die immediately from second hand smoke -	non-experiential
but a fire may happen.	non-experiential
also, if there is an anaphylactic shock from peanut exposure then the entire plane may have to emergency land, causing possible danger to all passengers -	non-experiential
my parents never thought to get me tested	experiential
and i just didn't know what made me so sick at times.	unverifiable
i only learned when my children was sick and then got tested.	experiential
i learned that peanut allergies among children have tripled over the past 10 years.	non-experiential
so please either ban peanuts and peanut products or at least ban service of peanuts and peanut products on flights where the airlines know there is a passenger with a peanut allergy.	unverifiable
this is the only way to ensure everyones safety, not to mention comfort.	unverifiable
do not in any way regulate the service of peanuts on airlines.	unverifiable
this is a ridiculous intrusion on free enterprise and personal freedom.	unverifiable
not to mention, it will simply encourage freedom loving travelers to bring large amounts of peanuts on the aircraft themselves.	unverifiable
someone should stuff a bag of peanuts up the backside of ray lahood for proposing this stupid proposal.	unverifiable
what a lot of people don't realize is that peanut allergies actually worsen as a person ages.	non-experiential
i have had a fatal peanut allergy all my life,	experiential
and at age 28, i found my throat swelling from the smell of peanut products.	experiential
also, epipens are great,	unverifiable
but they do not stop the reaction to all people.	non-experiential
i carry two injections with me all the time,	experiential
and those injections buy me an hour to get to a hospital for further treatment.	experiential
without a hospital and immediate follow-up care, i would continue in a reaction.	experiential
yes, it can happen,	non-experiential
it does happen,	non-experiential
it will continue to happen,	unverifiable
and as i am afraid to fly for this very reason, i urge you to do something!	unverifiable
you cannot count on epipens to do everything!	unverifiable
i vote for banning all peanut products and making an announcement, asking passengers to refrain from eating any peanut products they may have brought on board, if a passenger informs the airline about his or her allergy.	unverifiable
regardless of the formula used by airlines to compensate bumped passengers or even if flights are delayed for over 3 hours that fact remains	unverifiable
ailines are not forthcomiong with passengers about their rights.	non-experiential
technically the airline is required to compensate passengers with a meal voucher.	non-experiential
it's been my experience you'll get the voucher but only if you ask.	experiential
many families and individuals traveling are on a budget -	unverifiable
that 3 hour delay can kill a budget for unexpected meals.	non-experiential
airlines should be required to announce and post on the gate flight board that  passengers can claim a meal voucher during the delay.	unverifiable
vouchers ahould be handy to the airliner's customer service staff at the gate.	unverifiable
it's all about establishing systems that are clear and protocol is established.	unverifiable
that means if a flight is delayed longer than 3 hours or a passenger is bumped as system is in place that is tranparent to airline personell and airline customers.	unverifiable
no tiny font but rather written in a conspicuous place, in large font, and clear to all what the policy is, how it is applied and what process is used for a passenger to receive compensation - be it a meal voucher or for being bumped.	unverifiable
clear and understandable to all with no opportunity for any airline or passenger to work the system.	unverifiable
i agree with msolo and frequentflyer comments	unverifiable
absolutely no increase in price for anything that's already been paid for!	unverifiable
there are too many simple-minded examples of why this is just wrong.	unverifiable
i couldn't even list them all here.	unverifiable
"bottom line is, once a customer has agreed upon a price with the seller, and that happens when the customer pays, the seller absolutely cannot go back and play ""changes"" with the price."	unverifiable
once you pay for it, it's paid for, done...	unverifiable
no more money can be collected from the customer.	unverifiable
even if the travel provider made a mistake on the price, they should have to absorb their mistake.	unverifiable
it's the travel provider's mistake...	unverifiable
the customer agreed to the deal in good faith with the seller and paid the seller as expected.	unverifiable
there is no way the seller should be permitted to collect additional funds from the customer.	unverifiable
"i also agree that ""once you pay for it... no more money can be collected from the customer"", in in extreme situations such a a spike in fuel costs."	unverifiable
an airline can hedge its fuel costs by signing long term agreements.	non-experiential
i believe that southwest has done this.	non-experiential
i've  never had to cancel a flight after purchase,	experiential
but that blows my mind.	unverifiable
lhr, the last time i flew there, had $400 in taxes on each ticket.	experiential
that's insane!	unverifiable
i speak from  experience as someone stuck on the tarmac in austin for 6 and hours years ago, before we had cell phones and could call police or the media to make a story about it.	experiential
yes, uniform time limit on tarmac delays for all flights at all airports.	unverifiable
the inconvenience to passengers is no different no matter what airport they are at.	unverifiable
3 hours is inconvenient, but perhaps acceptable and reasonable, but not a minute longer.	unverifiable
yes, allow passengers to deplane with security in place.	unverifiable
not allowing this process is simply because it would likely be more expensive than imprisoning passengers on planes for hours.	unverifiable
all the proposed solutions sound great to me.	unverifiable
advertised prices should always include the total price  for any seller of a ticket.	unverifiable
"no one should be allowed to ""increase"" the price of a ticket once it is purchased."	unverifiable
"it is up to the ""seller"" to know what they need to charge for a ticket."	unverifiable
if they are too lazy to keep updated, they should eat the cost.	unverifiable
i agree with all the dot proposals for air travel,	unverifiable
"however i also agree with what others have stated regarding ""one way  or  each way"" fare proposal not going far enough."	unverifiable
if round trip is required than the full rt fare is what should be in the ad.	unverifiable
yes, definitely.	unverifiable
regarding post purchase price increases, that practice is either extortion or coercion or both, and should be completely banned.	unverifiable
if i purchase a trip at a particular price that is our contracted price and they should not be allowed to change it, thus destroying my plans and or or leaving such a bad taste of being ripped off that it effectively ruins the trip.	unverifiable
since this is sometimes done close to departure date it leaves customers or passengers with little option but to pay.	unverifiable
"last winter i had to make two round-trips to an airport in a blizzard to take family members for a flight posted as ""on time""."	experiential
they had non-refundable tickets and saw no option but to go or lose their money.	experiential
seven hours later their flight was canceled.	experiential
i feel that, in this case, the airline acted in their own interest giving no thought to the impact on the passengers.	unverifiable
surely they had better information.	unverifiable
that said, i don't have a suggestion as i don't know enough about airline information systems.	unverifiable
kas well reasoned.	unverifiable
law must be respected.	unverifiable
before any rule is made, i would like to see actual hard evidence of the number of incidents graded into at least a simple severity level, e.g., discomfort, controllable severe symptoms, uncontrollable severe symptoms.	unverifiable
i have friends who have peanut allergies that range from mild to severe or life-threatening.	experiential
they all are willing to let people know of their condition, but are also willing to take precautions for themselves to minimize their exposures.	experiential
only as a last resort do they seek to limit use by others, and then only to the extent necessary to avoid exposure that would thwart their precautions.	experiential
i could not be happier if airlines discontinue serving peanuts on flights.	unverifiable
as a life long peanut allergy sufferer, i have always held out hope that airlines would recognize that they are providing their passengers with the  1 food allergy product.	unverifiable
i have seen many arguments that they should be banned in restaurants, ballparks etc.,	unverifiable
however, those venues are completely voluntary	non-experiential
establishments that promote or provide peanuts that are shelled and thrown on the floor do not get my business	unverifiable
but airline travel is a closed quarters, necessity for many people.	unverifiable
i, for one, have to contend with residue and airborne particulate from those little bags of roasted peanuts served on aircraft almost on a daily basis	experiential
since i am an airline captain.	experiential
for 22 years i have been meticulous with keeping my work environment  safe for me by not consuming items that may contain peanuts, avoiding touching my eyes and asking my co-pilot not to consume bagged peanuts	experiential
other peanut products that don't risk going airborne are usually ok.	experiential
unfortunately, my ability to control my environment becomes more difficult when i am assigned a reposition flight and must ride as a passenger.	experiential
i advise the flight attendants and hope they remember.	unverifiable
i have suffered mild or moderate anaphyalactic and asthmatic distress if i am unaware that someone opened a bag of peanuts.	unverifiable
thankfully that type of exposure is not life threatening	non-experiential
but the concern is very real.	unverifiable
i am not a child,	experiential
i am not traveling for pleasure	experiential
and i don't have the power of completely removing something that can be life threatening for me while at work	experiential
so i do the best i can to continue safely performing my duties as an airline pilot.	unverifiable
i support the ban for airlines not to serve bagged peanut products and support the requirement that a public address announcement be made for those that have brought their own on board refrain from consuming them.	unverifiable
when traveling in the cabin, i am always aware of those around me and what they are consuming.	experiential
i have come to find that my sensitivity is mostly a distance of 1 row forward and back and two seats laterally .	experiential
if i can detect the odor of peanuts then i become concerned.	unverifiable
in case you were wondering, yes i do carry an epinephrine auto injector , allegra and  antihistamine eye drops.	experiential
not having peanuts served during a flight would be of great benefit for me and other allergy sufferers.	unverifiable
as a side note, commercial grade, not cold pressed, peanut oil is fine for most peanut allergy sufferers.	non-experiential
the process of extracting the oil leaves none of the offending protein.	non-experiential
i have consumed many products prepared with peanut oil, albeit with great trepidation, and have not had any adverse reactions.	unverifiable
the ground delay limitation, has, well, it's limitations.	unverifiable
if we were in pre-regulation days where an airline was making money with only 60% of the seats filled, flights canceling due to the 3 hour limit would not be much of a problem.	unverifiable
what is a problem is flights that are now being canceled because of the new rule and virtually no seats available on subsequent flights to accommodate those passengers.	unverifiable
if the ground delays are due to atc, weather, vip movement  then passengers will not be, as a rule, given cancellation perks	non-experiential
since they are beyond the control of the company.	non-experiential
if the air conditioning, and restrooms are functioning properly and there are plenty of beverages and snacks on board then that maximum number of hours should be flexible.	unverifiable
i would be curious to hear from people that had their flight cancel due to the 3 hour limit and how the airlines handled them after that.	unverifiable
my guess this rule will cause greater damage to air travel then the occasional extended ground hold on an airplane with poor air conditioning or non-functioning lavatories.	unverifiable
anyone who actually suffers from a life-threatening reaction to peanuts should not be on a plane at all.	unverifiable
if the presence of peanut dust on an airliner is that risky to them, they know they shouldn't be flying.	unverifiable
despite what faan claims, there is no scientific data to support the idea that large numbers of people are dying from anaphylactic shock due to peanut allergies, or even that peanut allergies are on the rise through natural causes.	non-experiential
gullible parents telling their kids not to eat peanuts	unverifiable
because they are or might be allergic causes needless anxiety for those children,	unverifiable
and when they finally are exposed to peanuts or peanut dust, they end up having an allergy.	unverifiable
that's irresponsible parenting.	unverifiable
at the same time, most of the population is allergic to one or ore types of dust;	non-experiential
they'd be unable to open the doors to board or disembark,	non-experiential
and you'd have to close all the airports, too.	non-experiential
allergies are not disabilities.	non-experiential
if that were true, then the 80 percent or more people who have a deviated septum would also qualify as having a disability,	non-experiential
yet nobody's proposing that airlines supply a separate, non-emergency oxygen supply to help them breathe better.	unverifiable
it's time to put an end to bending to the agenda of special interest groups that have a political agenda:	unverifiable
one that isn't based on science, but instead based solely on fear and claims that can't be supported by scientific facts.	unverifiable
there is no scientific data to support the claim that food allergies have doubled during any time period, much less the one that's mentioned by laura.	non-experiential
"if you read the nchs data brief on the cdc web site, it specifically uses the term ""reported food allergy"","	non-experiential
which isn't the same as an actual food allergy.	non-experiential
parents report just about any adverse reaction to food as an allergy,	non-experiential
but true allergies can only be confirmed by observing the patient after consuming the suspect food and testing for the presence of ige antibodies.	non-experiential
without that, all you have are overanxious parents conflating two separate and distinct things into the same, potentially life-threatening thing.	unverifiable
i was on a flight with a similar issue recently.	experiential
"first the customer was told that they couldn't give out blankets anymore because of the recent ""flu outbreak"" subsequent liability issues."	experiential
the next flight attendant offered to sell the customer a blanket.	experiential
apparently the illness threat vanishes for a fee.	unverifiable
apparently samsmom is the ignorant one.	unverifiable
she attacks what she clearly does not understand.	unverifiable
if her child has a true peanut allergy that is so severe, he shouldn't be flying,	unverifiable
since her argument is that any contact with peanut dust or oil would cause anaphylactic shock.	non-experiential
since that possibility is very real even outside an airline cabin, she's making her own argument for living in a bubble.	unverifiable
facts are stubborn things,	unverifiable
and one of those facts is that the air onboard an airliner is cleaner than in most public buildings,	non-experiential
so there's very little, if any, real risk involved in flying on a jet where peanuts have been consumed before or are even being served now.	non-experiential
another stubborn fact is that you can be desensitized to peanut allergies,	non-experiential
but if you're unwilling to do it, don't blame others for not bending to your petty fears.	unverifiable
i don't support banning guns or cigarettes either.	unverifiable
those are choices people make	unverifiable
and that is what i support	unverifiable
and what i propose...choice.	unverifiable
if you think a ride is dangerous for your child you don't let them ride it.	unverifiable
"is it their ""right"" to be have the ride toned down for them"	unverifiable
this, like many other regulations is simply taking that choice and handing it over to the government and forcing their decision on everyone.	unverifiable
just because peanuts may kill someone doesn't mean everyone else should have no choice in eating them.	unverifiable
no, allergies are not disabilities,	non-experiential
and therefore you get no special treatment under the ada.	non-experiential
federal courts have consistently ruled this way.	non-experiential
i'm not sure about this,	unverifiable
but i assume that all or most of this data collection is totally automated for the large carriers.	non-experiential
in other words, this data isn't being collected by some human accountant type with a green visor and a pad and pencil.	non-experiential
it's simply being pulled out of databases that already contain the information.	non-experiential
if so, why would it be so hard for the smaller or foreign carriers to implement the same solution.	unverifiable
just digitally collect the information and transmit it to the authorities for analysis.	unverifiable
first, i find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting.	non-experiential
this is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children.	non-experiential
but it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer.	unverifiable
i've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 .	experiential
by the age of 6, i knew how to take my medications myself.	experiential
since the epipen has come out, i've carried epinephrine with me.	experiential
and i've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand.	experiential
i would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand,	unverifiable
though i would expect them to have a first-aid kit.	unverifiable
opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying.	unverifiable
it might be possible when the sufferer is a child -	non-experiential
perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for christmas instead of taking a plane.	non-experiential
this depends, of course, on where grandma lives -	unverifiable
if she lives in california, and the family lives in maine, there might be problems.	unverifiable
adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons.	unverifiable
as a graduate student, i studied at a university eight hours from home.	experiential
a few months ago, there was a family emergency at home.	experiential
my choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time.	experiential
i chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy.	unverifiable
"they created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me."	experiential
i still had a mild reaction ,	experiential
so that when i did arrive at the hospital, i had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one.	experiential
towards the end of graduate school, i applied to a number of jobs all over the us and was granted interviews at many of them.	experiential
for offices that were far away, i chose the interviews that i did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city.	experiential
i feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once i had taken medication.	unverifiable
i've had allergies since the age of 2,	experiential
so i understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others.	unverifiable
but when i take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or i fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts,	unverifiable
"i shudder to think what life will be like when i am a ""full-fledged"" working adult."	unverifiable
it sounds dramatic,	unverifiable
but it's not melodramatic.	unverifiable
the only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.	unverifiable
i personally have suffered from peanut allergies for over 40 years.	experiential
if there are packaged peanuts served on board a flight, it's 100% guaranteed that i will have a reaction from the peanut dust.	experiential
i do not agree with a buffer zone for a couple of reasons.	unverifiable
for me, it's the dust in the air.	unverifiable
someone posted that the air circulates peanut dust right out of the air but apparently not quick enough to prevent a life threatening reaction.	unverifiable
you know, airlines tried to create non-smoking zones on airplanes	non-experiential
but that didn't work either.	experiential
i have been on flights where nasty  flight attendants have made sarcastic remarks about me and my allergies especially on one delta flight.	unverifiable
northwest was great	unverifiable
because they respected their passengers enough to address their concerns and prohibited peanuts altogether.	unverifiable
it was as much a relief to walk onto one of their flights as it was to walk onto one of the first smoke free flights!	unverifiable
smokers use to use the same logic and reasoning to justify smoking on flights as these peanut proponents are using now.	unverifiable
i flew on many smoking flights and never needed to inject myself so that i could breathe -	experiential
i can't say the same for flights with peanuts.	unverifiable
you can read about it here:	non-experiential
food allergy initiative - another propaganda piece by the allergists.	unverifiable
you can't trust what people report, there are millions of hypochondriacs out there.	unverifiable
if you are one of the very very very few who actually have a doctor diagnosed serious allergy - don't fly.	unverifiable
this has nothing to do with lacking compassion;	unverifiable
it has everything to do with coddling people who fear a possibility that is so unlikely.	unverifiable
there's no potential lawsuit threat here,	unverifiable
because airlines are not liable for your medical condition or your refusal to take precautions against it.	non-experiential
nonsense.	unverifiable
cite the confirmed reports if you want to be taken seriously.	unverifiable
if you think it's not a hardship for other passengers to be denied peanuts based on the very small minority of peanut allergy sufferers, then it's not a hardship for you to take responsibility for your own well being, no matter the form of transportation.	unverifiable
instead, you want others to cater to your whims and unfounded fears.	unverifiable
since there's no reason to ban peanuts to begin with, the only thing you'd accomplish by banning all food is to have a large number of cranky, hungry passengers on longer flights.	unverifiable
not exactly a good way to engender customer loyalty or goodwill.	unverifiable
firstly, i have traveled relatively frequently out of the usa.	experiential
what i find very interesting is that on the various airlines i have used, none have applied the baggage charge on my return flights from the other countries back to the usa.	experiential
it leaves me to believe that either the other countries airline offices are operating on their own and more efficiently and therefore find it unnecessary to charge for baggage or that there is something definitely not transparent.	unverifiable
"furthermore, it is my opinion that if there is a ""charge"" for something, in this case baggage, that it is a contract and that the baggage if not delivered with the owner and the time of arrival, then the contract has been broken and a refund is due the customer."	unverifiable
we have all seen it, the person boarding the plane with the carry on bag loaded with food.	unverifiable
i hope that the airline would charge you!	unverifiable
there are millions of americans who are afflicted by medical conditions;	non-experiential
asthma, hemophilia, high blood pressure, risk of strokes, and the list goes on and on.	non-experiential
each of these people take responsibility for their own health.	unverifiable
when they leave home they prepare for the dangerous they will face even those which are not dangerous to others.	unverifiable
when you ask us, the general public to take responsibility for the safety of your daughter you are ignoring your own responsibilities and setting a bad example for your child.	unverifiable
i appreciate your circumstance.	unverifiable
but because you don't like the smell of nuts, we can't go instituting bans on foods.	unverifiable
i don't like the smell of fast food -	unverifiable
as for food options, pack you own.	unverifiable
i do.	experiential
i bring my own snacks.	experiential
people with severe metabolic conditions like pku travel with their own food.	non-experiential
bring a bag of pretzels. raisins. whatever.	unverifiable
"it sounds like your ""awful"" experiences have not resulted in any allergic reactions."	unverifiable
bans on foods should be based exclusively on research.	unverifiable
not on people feeling uncomfortable around certain foods.	unverifiable
because if that's what regulations are based on, then there will soon be nothing served on any flight -	unverifiable
and i don't think that's what anyone wants.	unverifiable
again, i hope the dot seriously considers actual research when making regulations.	unverifiable
baggage fees never impact my decision to travel	unverifiable
because i only have one choice for a regional carrier to take me to an airport hub.	experiential
i find that people who rarely travel are the most confused by fees and services, expecting the 'good old days' of in-flight meals, movies, and free luggage.	unverifiable
however, since i often get tickets online and use airlines with code-share agreements, fees across these agreements should be standardized, not individualized.	unverifiable
all optional fees should be listed separately.	unverifiable
these should be listed prominently on a travel web site, airline web site, ticket counter, and on the boarding pass.	unverifiable
i can't remember how many times i've lost my receipt for baggage fees when trying to be reimbursed by my company for business travel, and to have to root through my wallet or purse for a tiny slip of paper is ridiculous.	unverifiable
make all signs standard for each airline:	unverifiable
you don't need to figure out where each menu item is listed at mcdonald's --	unverifiable
they're all the same to make ordering easier for the customer.	unverifiable
plain english , written at a fifth grade level.	unverifiable
i wouldn't reduce my carry-ons if checked baggage were free	unverifiable
because i never put my lap-top computer in a checked bag.	experiential
i carry an overnight bag just in case my checked luggage goes missing .	experiential
but a good suggestion about airlines enforcing their carry-on bag limits  would go a long way to reducing traveler frustration.	unverifiable
i also think anyone carrying their belongings in a plastic grocery bag should be stopped at the gate and forced to buy a more sturdy woven bag for a nominal fee.	unverifiable
the incidence of pku is low - about 1 in 30,000.	non-experiential
but when you combine all the inborn metabolic conditions that require special diets  the incidence is much higher.	non-experiential
consider also diabetes.	unverifiable
consider other conditions, such as hypertension .	unverifiable
the point is, there are a lot of people that have special dietary restrictions.	non-experiential
not being able to eat a specific food shouldn't preclude that food from being served -	unverifiable
it just means that those folks need to bring their own.	unverifiable
the real issue is, how real is the threat of inhaled peanut dust.	unverifiable
again, i have seen no study that has shown it to be a real threat	non-experiential
but that doesn't mean such a study doesn't exist.	non-experiential
that should be the main criteria for the dot decision.	unverifiable
what the airlines do is meaningless if passengers start bringing their own on.	unverifiable
as i understand it, the dot considers peanut allergies to fall under the ada	non-experiential
"because peanut dust in the air can cause an allergic reaction leading to an inability to breathe, clearly a ""substantial limiting"" of a ""major life activity"" as defined by the ada and successive court decisions."	unverifiable
while banning peanuts is a solution,	unverifiable
given the high volume of sales the peanut industry derives from the airlines, this particular solution would seem to place an undue burden on the peanut industry.	unverifiable
while airlines may choose to no longer carry peanuts that would be a decrease in revenue for the peanut industry because of market forces.	non-experiential
if the airlines are forced to do so, the government, through its application of the ada, would be placing a rather large financial burden on the peanut industry,	unverifiable
and, more importantly, the workers who are laid off and their families.	unverifiable
"while creating ""by-request"" flights that are peanut-free is also a solution to the initial problem,"	unverifiable
this would seem to both place an undue burden on and or or lead to a fundamental alteration of services for the airlines.	unverifiable
it would seem that changing the nature of a flight, once booked, could be legally construed as a breach of the contract created by the purchase of the ticket.	unverifiable
"if those customers, whether through fondness of peanuts or disdain for this particular regulation, refused to accept a seat on a ""peanut free"" flight, imagine the chaos as the airlines attempted to place passengers on flights to the same destination, leaving and arriving at the same time as the one initially booked, but not designated ""peanut free"""	unverifiable
after all, air travel is not usually the end, but simply a means.	unverifiable
once flights are booked, other plans tend to be made.	unverifiable
"if certain flights were always designated ""peanut free"" or if ""peanut free"" flights had to be requested before anyone else booked seating, those with allergies would have to accept a much more limited option in flight choice or plan to fly far in advance of the average traveler, hardly acceptable under ada guidelines,"	unverifiable
or the airlines would be forced to significantly increase the amount of flights flown each day in order to ensure that there were enough flights of both types to meet everyone's needs.	unverifiable
if the airlines chose the latter, this would be an undue burden, and any of the three would require the airlines to fundamentally alter the way they operate.	unverifiable
creating buffer zones, while arguably acceptable by ada standards, unfortunately does not guarantee the safety of those allergic to peanuts and may even further endanger them.	non-experiential
unless the buffer-zones were tightly sealed and reliant on their own independent air system , it simply would not be possible to ensure that no dust was blown into the buffer zone by overhead fans or carried through the air system.	non-experiential
"worse still to contemplate, but worth mentioning nonetheless, is the unfortunate fact that angry persons may intentionally violate the buffer zone to ""punish"" those they perceive as receiving preferential treatment or being responsible for a violation of their ""rights"""	unverifiable
the tone of some of the comments on this site themselves indicate strong feelings against providing such large-scale accommodation for such a small segment of the population,	unverifiable
and, as of now, this is merely a hypothetical.	unverifiable
there is, however, a much simpler solution that, frankly, i'm surprised nobody yet has presented: airline provided surgical masks to prevent air born contamination and either thoroughly sanitized seating to prevent skin contact with oils left by previous passengers or, for those who don't feel secure in sanitization procedure, sealed cleanroom suits available upon request.	unverifiable
a quick google check turned up boxes of 50 medical grade surgical masks for $22, a company named microarray selling individually sealed cleanroom suits with hood and boots for $27.45 each, and a 40 pack of latex gloves for $6.	unverifiable
this provides a cheap and perfectly effective solution to what is, apparently, a very occasional problem.	unverifiable
these masks and suits are considered safe enough to avoid contamination in the most sensitive of settings: operating rooms, high technology clean rooms, etc.	unverifiable
they should be safe enough to avoid any chance of accidental inhalation or contact with peanut allergens.	unverifiable
while some may not like having to wear a mask or dress in a suit to avoid having an allergic reaction	unverifiable
the line has to be drawn somewhere.	unverifiable
the ada requires that persons with disabilities be accommodated	non-experiential
but it does not require that they be accommodated in a fashionable manner or in a manner identical to the non-disabled.	non-experiential
movie theatres are required to provide handicap accessible seating,	non-experiential
but they are not required to provide it anywhere in the theater that a disabled patron may want to sit.	non-experiential
but i believe that it is better to have a few persons unhappy about wearing a garment than a whole country full of people angry that their ability to eat what they want has been unnecessarily restricted.	unverifiable
the only other problem  to this solution that i can foresee is young children who take off the mask or who fuss and complain about having to wear them.	unverifiable
fortunately, the solution to this should be with them already; their parents.	unverifiable
the safety of a child should always be first and foremost the responsibility of their parent.	unverifiable
if a parent has a child with a severe peanut allergy, they should already be used to maintaining vigilance over their child's safety.	unverifiable
in this case, that means making sure the mask is tied on tight or that the child is kept from taking it off.	unverifiable
the wonderful and well trained flight attendants on many flights can aid in this by presenting these masks and suits to young children as though they were a rare privilege, just like those plastic flight wings.	unverifiable
as for children fussing about their attire, well, if one reads through the comments here, one can conclude that fussing children on an airplane is simply business as usual.	unverifiable
as those who are disabled must accept that their accommodations may not be exactly what they desire,	unverifiable
those who are not disabled must also accept that sometimes accommodating our disabled brethren requires a bit of sacrifice on our own parts, whether it's not being able to sit or park in the spot you want, because it's handicap accessible, or putting up with a fussing child or paying $5 for a headset to drown them out.	unverifiable
don't limit it to peanut allergies.	unverifiable
i can never fly.	unverifiable
because i have an airborne allergy to chewing gum other people have or chew.	experiential
i can't even go through some checkout lines in some stores,	unverifiable
because they stock gum there.	non-experiential
i also can't use mass transportation for this reason.	experiential
if anyone chews gum on the bus or train, i go into anaphylactic shock.	experiential
my airway closes off and fills up with mucus.	experiential
this seems to be part of my latex allergy.	experiential
i also had trouble with jury duty.	experiential
the way to do this is to let the allergic passenger state any airborne allergy.	unverifiable
then that substance would not be allowed on the flight.	unverifiable
alternatively, give each passenger a clean air supply unpolluted by materials other passengers have.	unverifiable
do not recirculate the air.	unverifiable
i have the same kind of allergy trouble, but with chewing gum, new latex rubber products, new tires, pencil erasers, and burning rubber.	experiential
i am not allergic to peanuts.	experiential
i originally had this posted in another section, but it seems more appropriate here.	unverifiable
i have an alternate solution to suggest: airline provided surgical masks to prevent airborne contamination and either thoroughly sanitized seating to prevent skin contact with oils left by previous passengers or, for those who don't feel secure in sanitization procedure, sealed cleanroom suits available upon request.	unverifiable
a quick google check turned up boxes of 50 medical grade surgical masks for $22, a company named microarray selling individually sealed cleanroom suits with hood and boots for $27.45 each, and a 40 pack of latex gloves for $6.	non-experiential
this provides a cheap and perfectly effective solution to what is, apparently, a very occasional problem.	unverifiable
these masks and suits are considered safe enough to avoid contamination in the most sensitive of settings: operating rooms, high technology clean rooms, etc.	unverifiable
they should be safe enough to avoid any chance of accidental inhalation or contact with peanut allergens.	unverifiable
one thing i like about this as a solution is that it works equally well for all forms of airborne allergens, not just peanuts.	unverifiable
gluten allergies are not normally spread through the air.	non-experiential
the limiting factors on such a rule should be:	unverifiable
* such a passenger is actually on the flight.	non-experiential
* the passenger is affected in such a way that can cause permanent damage or death.	non-experiential
* the allergen is spread by airborne or contact means, not through consumption of the food.	non-experiential
examples of such substances are peanuts, chewing gum, new rubber products, perfumes, and some skin softening products.	non-experiential
what should be done:	unverifiable
* the allergic person should declare the allergy when buying the ticket.	unverifiable
* the plane should be cleaned of such substances before the flight.	unverifiable
* the materials other people have should be checked in the baggage.	unverifiable
* other passengers who object should be offered an alternate flight.	unverifiable
"and those ""obviously health"" people you see have invisible heart conditions that can produce a heart attack if they overexert."	unverifiable
also, you might be seeing a normal spouse or relative parking the car to pick up a handicapped person who is in the building.	unverifiable
i feel that this is overdue and should be addressed for all flights - both international and domestic.	unverifiable
funny that we need a law to indicate a plane needs to provide adequate water and facilities.	unverifiable
i would like to see the rule be under 3 hours	unverifiable
but 3 would be the maximum amount of time for people to sit on a plane.	non-experiential
i think this issue should only be touched if a clear adverse effect can be demonstrated, either in health impacts or in those avoiding flight for fear of peanuts.	unverifiable
as for the epinephrine auto-injector, the planes should probably have one available,	unverifiable
just as they should have a defibrillator available	unverifiable
because they are so far from medical care.	unverifiable
anyone with a peanut allergy who is not a fool will have one on them whether required to or not.	unverifiable
the plane does not use recycled air,	non-experiential
so perhaps requesting people in a certain area of a plane, or on a certain flight not have peanuts if someone can submit documentation of a severe peanut allergy that would be reasonable.	unverifiable
this may be a small inconvenience,	unverifiable
but so is forcing everyone else not to have peanuts,	unverifiable
and since this is for the passenger with the allergy,	unverifiable
its nothing to ask of them.	unverifiable
a blanket ban is simply overkill without a specific need,	unverifiable
and any products with ingredients, like snickers, need to be demonstrated to be dangerous.	unverifiable
you cannot just ban products because someone fears they might be dangerous,	unverifiable
without proof it is an unnecessary invasion of the privacy and choice of other passengers.	unverifiable
i have lived my entire life with a peanut allergy;	experiential
i carry emergency medicines with me at all times.	experiential
in the past i have flown on planes serving peanut products and have been fine.	experiential
i stopped flying on flights serving peanuts after having an asthma attack on a southwest flight in 2007.	experiential
it was not a life-threatening reaction	experiential
but, to me, further exposure was not worth the risk.	unverifiable
in allergic individuals each allergen exposure results in a faster, more severe reaction the next time they come in contact with the allergen due to antibody production.	non-experiential
so far i have not relied on the government to keep me safe;	unverifiable
i vote with my wallet and pay to fly on airlines that do not serve peanuts	experiential
* i know that there are individuals who are more sensitive to peanut dust than i am.	non-experiential
if it is at all likely that a single customer can suffer a  life-threatening reaction on an airplane, i believe peanuts should not be served because of that person.	unverifiable
i cannot understand why all airlines do not voluntarily stop serving peanuts.	unverifiable
* i believe that the risk posed by peanuts to a small percentage of the population warrants them not being served on airplanes.	unverifiable
air travel is a necessary part of modern living and cannot be avoided by those with allergies.	non-experiential
i do not believe that airlines need - or should - carry epipens.	unverifiable
the people best trained to use them are those with the allergy and presumably will have their own if the risk demands.	unverifiable
* i cannot fathom why airlines would go through the trouble of carrying epipens  just so they can continue to serve peanuts.	unverifiable
it seems as if some people believe that peanuts are the only thing that can be served on an airplane.	unverifiable
* i do not believe that foods which would release peanut dust into the air should be served.	unverifiable
in my mind this includes packages of peanuts and peanut butter crackers.	unverifiable
for simplicity's sake i would support a total peanut ban on airplanes	unverifiable
but this may be impossible.	non-experiential
having read ingredient labels for my entire life, i am no longer surprised by the unlikely foods that contain peanuts.	unverifiable
dot department of transportation believes that a severe peanut allergy counts as a disability.	non-experiential
how about people that are allergic to strawberries, pollen, dairy, ect.	unverifiable
we have got to put a stop to this.	unverifiable
the government is taking too much control.	unverifiable
these whiny people that can't take care of themselves, expecting the government to pass laws so that they don't have to do anything.	unverifiable
grow up, be an adult.	unverifiable
no one is forcing you to eat, breath or even be around peanuts.	unverifiable
get a plastic bubble.	unverifiable
banning peanuts from planes would be as dumb as making separate flights for people that are allergic.	unverifiable
i am so tired of hearing people complain becasue the world does not rotate the way they want it to.	unverifiable
get over it.	unverifiable
you are not the only person in this planet.	unverifiable
we do not all bow down to your every command.	unverifiable
you are the minority.	unverifiable
you adapt to our world or you stay home.	unverifiable
that's the issue:	unverifiable
the possibility is so remote as to be infinitesimal,	non-experiential
and it's never happened.	non-experiential
which is why there's no reason to start banning foods on airlines.	unverifiable
there's no danger of a lawsuit,	unverifiable
since all passengers accept the risks when flying,	unverifiable
just as when sports fans accept the risks of being injured at a game.	unverifiable
it's part of the terms you accept when buying a ticket.	unverifiable
since the risk to that very small percentage of people is so remote,	unverifiable
there's no reason to ban peanuts or any other type of food.	unverifiable
everyone is allergic to something,	non-experiential
so that would also mean other foods would need to be banned, up to the point where there would no longer be anything served during flight.	unverifiable
that is an absurd overreaction for a small group of people.	unverifiable
there's a risk of the plan crashing,	non-experiential
so maybe we should ban air travel, too.	unverifiable
likewise, the risk of someone drowning is much greater,	unverifiable
but you're not advocating we ban swimming pools or swimming.	non-experiential
air travel is part of modern living,	unverifiable
but unless you're crossing the ocean, you aren't being forced to fly,	unverifiable
and nothing prevents any allergy sufferer from flying except irrational fears such as this one.	unverifiable
if you don't know,, then you really have no idea what you're talking about here.	unverifiable
pretzels contain gluten, which is also a food allergy, along with higher levels of salt,	non-experiential
which is not good for people who have high blood pressure.	non-experiential
your simplistic belief that banning peanuts would solve a problem is not founded in reality.	unverifiable
there are already peanuts on-board the aircraft,	non-experiential
so that assumed threat will still be there, but still not affecting you in any way.	unverifiable
"that will just cause you to focus on something even more inane, like trying to force airlines to remove the seats and the sub-floor to get rid of all those peanuts, replace the seats entirely, and have certain aircraft designated as ""peanut free""."	unverifiable
there is no growing trend in the number of people who are allergic to peanuts;	non-experiential
that is a talking point of faan that is unsupported by any scientific evidence.	non-experiential
peanuts are not dangerous.	unverifiable
those with severe peanut allergies are at some risk if they are exposed to peanuts,	non-experiential
which is no different than any other allergy.	unverifiable
after reading other people posts it is clear that most do not even understand what a real allergy is.	unverifiable
as a registered nurse i can tell you that a person who get nauseous at the smell or an upset tummy is not allergic,	non-experiential
that is an intolerance and is not life threatening.	non-experiential
my son spent 2 days in intensive care as a small child from a true peanut reaction.	experiential
for those saying that a small amount of peanuts in the air is not harmful, my child's throat closes up when he eats food that was processed in the same facility with peanuts and began this reaction on a plane with peanuts 5 rows in front of us.	experiential
we would not travel on air planes	unverifiable
if not for the fact that we have family in both florida and new york.	experiential
we cannot live near both.	experiential
we have to avoid many restaurants that serve peanuts,	experiential
and he cannot get ice cream at any place that offers peanuts as a topping.	experiential
we do not ask the world to revolve around his disability any more than any other person with a disability would ask for.	experiential
to answer the question about whether having just the flight that the allergic person is on be peanut-free would be helpful, it leaves room for error and with all of the other things that are banned on flights  it seems far more efficient to simply add it to the list.	unverifiable
i don't believe that is feasible or necessary, for 4 reasons.	unverifiable
first, studies have shown that the majority of self-reported allergies are in fact not allergies.	non-experiential
thus there would be unnecessary bans on many flights.	unverifiable
second, this would place a burden on airlines -	unverifiable
someone would essentially need to keep track for every flight whether peanuts can be served or not.	unverifiable
this would effectively remove peanuts from all flights.	unverifiable
third, this does not answer questions about passengers being able to bring peanut products on flights.	unverifiable
as long as passengers can, airline regulations are meaningless.	unverifiable
and in my opinion, it is not reasonable or legal to ban passengers from bringing on board any peanut containing product.	unverifiable
no - neither does.	unverifiable
until it can be shown that there is either a medically or legally warranted reason for a peanut ban, this issue should come to an end.	unverifiable
an allergy is not a handicap or a disability.	unverifiable
everyone is allergic to something,	non-experiential
so by your misguided definition, everyone is disabled or handicapped.	unverifiable
other allergens can be detected in the air and cause a reaction;	non-experiential
peanuts and latex are not the only things.	non-experiential
once you start to ban certain foods, you go down the slippery slope of banning other foods	unverifiable
because someone will be allergic to one or more ingredients in that food.	non-experiential
you are responsible for your condition and that of your children.	unverifiable
trying to shift that responsibility to other passengers is unreasonable in the extreme.	unverifiable
i would like to see evidence that peanut dust on airplanes has actually caused problems before the dot takes action.	unverifiable
if there is such evidence, i think that allowing sensitive passengers to make an advance request for a peanut-free flight is a sensible balance between a light regulatory touch and accommodating the real needs of passengers at risk.	unverifiable
in fact, if i were an airline executive, i simply wouldn't serve peanuts to avoid the problem--	unverifiable
but there is a difference between good airline policy and what belongs in a hard-and-fast rule;	unverifiable
the latter should be evidence-based and do the minimum required to solve the problem.	unverifiable
i would only support restrictive rules banning passengers from carrying any items containing peanuts if and only if airlines resumed serving free meals.	unverifiable
most people who do not suffer peanut allergies do not know how to purchase foods that don't contain peanuts.	non-experiential
it is unreasonable to expect that every single passenger on every single flight will avoid for example, peanut butter crackers, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chocolates, and thai food.	unverifiable
if airlines served free food on the flights once again, they could make sure the food did not contain any peanut products,	unverifiable
and the passengers would not feel the need to bring their own food and accidentally expose sensitive passengers to peanut products.	unverifiable
as you say yourself, the child just got hives.	experiential
this is not a dangerous reaction.	non-experiential
i've had hives before,	experiential
they are unpleasant.	unverifiable
so is hunger.	unverifiable
while a study on the effect airborne peanut dust in an aircraft has on people with peanut allergies is important,	unverifiable
legislators should not solely rely on such a study when considering a peanut ban on aircrafts.	unverifiable
other sources of peanut exposure on aircraft are also a large problem.	unverifiable
crumbs, peanut or peanut butter residue, and whole peanuts are regularly found on seats, in seat back pockets, on floors, and on tray tables from previous flights despite flight attendants' and cleaning crews' best efforts to clean the cabin.	non-experiential
my 4-year old daughter has a severe peanut allergy in addition to other food allergies not in consideration for this bill.	experiential
we limit our flying to destinations beyond a 13-hour drive by car.	experiential
we try to fly peanut-allergy-friendly airlines when it is not cost prohibitive.	experiential
when we do board an aircraft, we use baby wipes to clean our entire row of seats, seat belts, tray tables, and the seat back in front of us to remove peanut dust and residue.	experiential
in spite of our best efforts to minimize allergen exposure to our daughter, flying is still a very stressful event.	unverifiable
the few times we have flown, she invariably sneezes, scratches, and breaks out in hives; a far cry from anaphylaxis , but still a real possibility that keeps us on edge throughout the entire flight.	experiential
we do carry epipens and benadryl everywhere we go,	experiential
but for those who think having medication on hand in case of an allergic reaction is analogous to having spare pampers on hand to change to dirty diaper, you are incredibly out of touch with reality, uninformed on the issue, or both.	unverifiable
"for anyone to maintain that their hunger ""satisfaction"" from a 100-calorie bag of peanuts is more important than the safety and or or life of a human being is blatantly insensitive and ignorant."	unverifiable
take peanuts off of planes.	unverifiable
safety first.	unverifiable
it is plain to see mulder is uninformed on this topic.	unverifiable
"instead of chiding people from the ""peanut"" gallery perched in a factual void, take some time to go talk to an allergy specialist, attend a lecture on the matter, do some research from reputable sources, or even get to know someone with multiple severe food allergies and see exactly how their lives are affected."	unverifiable
take the time to truly educate yourself on the topic, then perhaps you could offer the constructive solutions i believe dot is looking for instead of flaming others from behind your irrational fear of losing peanut snacks on an aircraft.	unverifiable
in response to the post from a member comparing religious dietary restrictions to allergies  that is not a valid analogy.	unverifiable
domestic flights don't serve food anyway,	non-experiential
but for those that do include meals are more than happy to serve you a variety of meal types  if you just ask.	unverifiable
plus i've never seen a pig fly -	experiential
it's highly unlikely pork particles will become airborne and float about the cabin to offend someone with a religious sensitivity.	non-experiential
i follow a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet to control reactive hypoglycemia.	experiential
my diet requires small meals throughout the day.	experiential
before the advent of tsa restrictions on carry-on liquids, i was able to pack coldcut sandwiches with an ice pack in my carry-on luggage.	experiential
since ice packs are no longer allowed,	non-experiential
i rely on peanuts and peanut products to meet my dietary needs while traveling,	experiential
as they are non-perishable.	non-experiential
if peanuts were no longer allowed on flights,  it would be challenging to find an acceptable non-perishable that would meet my dietary needs.	unverifiable
i cannot rely on airlines to serve snacks that i can eat	unverifiable
and, when peanuts are offered, they are usually the only snack that would not precipitate a hypoglycemic reaction	non-experiential
meat-product jerky is not an acceptable option.	unverifiable
i understand that peanut allergies are life-threatening, as is hypoglycemia.	non-experiential
in the interest of accommodating both sets of needs, i suggest that airlines offer a high-protein snack, such as cheese sticks .	unverifiable
i also suggest that airlines offer environmentally-controlled sections for travelers with peanut allergies.	unverifiable
as a parent of preschoolers	experiential
i am very concerned about tarmac delays.	unverifiable
i do not want to be trapped in a plane with my children	unverifiable
and neither does anyone else.	unverifiable
children do not understand security threats or delays.	unverifiable
they have needs that must be met.	unverifiable
i hope their rights are represented as well.	unverifiable
because it does not matter the size of the plane.	unverifiable
it just matters if a person has their liberty restricted for some arbitrary reason.	unverifiable
the airlines have a responsibility to their passengers by boarding a place i am not giving up my welfare.	unverifiable
i am simply agreeing to fly.	unverifiable
if that is not possible, then let me deplane and in the meantime keep the environment comfortable.	unverifiable
1 there should be a minimum legroom size.	unverifiable
"most airline have seats with 31"" pitch,"	non-experiential
which prevents tall customers from sitting with their legs straight in front of them.	non-experiential
several hours of flying with legs canted to one side or the other is painful on both knees and hips. it is inexcusable to require tall passengers to pay large amounts of additional money to have adequate leg room.	unverifiable
2 on the other hand, overweight passengers who take up half of the seat of the person next to them should be required to pay for an additional seat.	unverifiable
it is unconscionable to require a passenger to have an overweight stranger plastered against them for several hours.	unverifiable
3 airport screening should be equitable for all passengers.	unverifiable
there is no justification for first class passengers having a separate and short line while other passengers endure long waits.	unverifiable
first class passengers pay the airlines for the superior accommodation, service, and food they receive while on board the airplane.	unverifiable
however, the screening is carried out by tsa, which is a government agency	non-experiential
and, as taxpayers and citizens, we all should be treated equally.	unverifiable
let them overbook, but make it painful if they deny boarding.	unverifiable
the suggested penalties are not strong enough.	unverifiable
the penalty should apply to all ticket holders except for company employees traveling on free tickets as part of their job.	unverifiable
first and foremost, whatever the penalty it must be paid in check or credit to a credit card immediately at the gate.	unverifiable
no more vouchers,	unverifiable
which tend to be be worthless because of the airlines travel rules and restrictions.	unverifiable
the starting point for the penalty should be the full fare cost of the ticket in whatever class the original ticket was issued.	unverifiable
so full y, b, or f fare; no discount.	unverifiable
it should include all fees and taxes that would apply to the ticket if purchased by the consumer.	unverifiable
this gets dot out of the business of determining the value and worrying about inflation adjusted costs;	unverifiable
the airline has already done the computation of the value of the ticket.	non-experiential
the consumer should also be booked at the airlines expense on the next available flight in the same class as the original ticket.	unverifiable
for every subsequent denied boarding for the consumer, they should get the same amount as the original payment to thus encourage the airline to get the passenger to their destination.	unverifiable
airlines should not be allowed to offer any reduction to this penalty but could offer more in order to get passengers to deplane.	unverifiable
vouchers do not count;	unverifiable
only cash incentives should be allowed.	unverifiable
the penalty should apply to any size commercial flight whether it be five, ten, or 300 seats.	unverifiable
only when the penalty for over booking is truly onerous will the airlines stop this despicable practice.	unverifiable
i have no sympathy for the airline as 90% of the tickets they sell are non-refundable and non-cancelable;	unverifiable
so they cannot be used and the airline gets its money.	unverifiable
as to the argument that costs will increase, etc., then let the airlines sell a standby ticket which is not subject to these rules and penalties	unverifiable
and let the consumer decide if they want to take the risk.	unverifiable
however, knowing how the airlines work, no more than 5% of all tickets sold nor more than 5% of total seat capacity of the flight  should be permitted to be sold in this special category	unverifiable
i don't envy you up against the lawyers the airlines have on their payroll to say nothing of the pressure the airlines will exert on congress to get this watered down.	unverifiable
if southwest serves peanuts, you could fly united, continental, or american airlines instead	unverifiable
the allergy policy of those airlines states that they do not serves peanuts inflight.	non-experiential
you know you have the option,	unverifiable
so you might as well act on it if it makes you uncomfortable.	unverifiable
if this was a real issue - ie: one that has an actual chance of happening, this board would be filled with tragic tales of dead loved ones killed by the evil peanut.	unverifiable
not one such story appears here!!!	non-experiential
it hasn't happened.	non-experiential
it wont happen.	unverifiable
it is doubtful that it ever could happen.	unverifiable
when people start actually getting injured, i'll consider giving up my peanuts.	unverifiable
until then, you peanut people are revealing yourselves as hysterical chicken littles crowing about the sky falling.	unverifiable
it seems a little silly.	unverifiable
it is essential that federal government sets minimum standard for customer service for all airlines.	unverifiable
the current contract of carriage from the airlines are all one sided that strongly favor airlines.	unverifiable
the airlines only care about their profit bottom line and have no concern for passengers well being.	unverifiable
the only way you can make them change their bad behaviors is the financial penalty .	unverifiable
once you bought the ticket you are at mercy of the airline.	unverifiable
they can reschedule the flight, delay the flight, change non-stop flight to multiple connections, etc. all without compensating passengers.	non-experiential
however, if passenger want to change anything they will be hit with huge changing fee plus fare increase.	unverifiable
in most other industries customers are the king.	unverifiable
only in airline business passengers have no  rights.	non-experiential
i was once being delayed at airport for 10 hours and united only offered $100 voucher.	experiential
they even knew the delay  the day before and won't notify the passengers.	experiential
when i found out the delay and asked to be put on other airline's flight they would not do it.	experiential
they don't care i missed the event or my kids got sick because of the long delay.	experiential
if they will be hit with huge financial penalty for such a long delay  they will definitely behave differently.	unverifiable
it is  time that airlines give back some basic rights to the passengers.	unverifiable
airlines should be required to post the price of their tickets including all taxes, fees, etc. so consumers can make easy comparisons.	unverifiable
yes, it is workable to have a single set of minimum customer service standards that apply to all airlines.	unverifiable
with all the emphasis on airline security, there is no reason baggage should be lost -	unverifiable
but if it is the airline should fully compensate passengers for losses as well as provide full reimbursement for clothing, toiletries, etc. purchased to replaced lost items.	unverifiable
airlines should be required to reimburse passengers for expenses when their baggage is delayed for more than 2 hrs. - purchase of personal items, clothing, toiletries, etc. until the baggage is delivered.	unverifiable
in both cases, devil is in the details - both passengers and airlines need to be protected.	unverifiable
yes, airlines should be required to fully refund all types of tickets or charges when there is a cancellation or significant delay and passengers choose not to fly.	unverifiable
all of the proposals should apply to all sizes of airplanes.	unverifiable
as a consultant and very frequent traveler, i can appreciate others' comments regarding perfumes and other allergies.	unverifiable
however, as the father of a child with a life-threatening peanut allergy, i believe the dot's distinction in this regard is well warranted.	unverifiable
"speaking from one family's perspective, i'd estimate that the cost of this risk to the airlines is about $4,000 annually in our ""non-purchased"" airfares -"	experiential
we have the resources and inclination to travel, but refrain due to the risk.	unverifiable
"the ""three row"" practice isn't sufficient."	unverifiable
airplanes are closed environments and cross-contamination is equally important to airborne transmission.	unverifiable
"more importantly, ""eating peanuts aboard a plane"" is not a ""right"", it is a ""convenience""."	unverifiable
i support regulation restricting airlines from having peanuts or peanut-inclusive or based products on-board for all commercial flights regardless of the aircraft size, the flight segment being flown, etc.	unverifiable
that said, although i don't believe that an airline should have the authority to restrict a passenger from bringing peanut products aboard a flight and consuming thereon,	unverifiable
i strongly believe that all passengers should be made aware of the fact that they may be liable for doing so.	unverifiable
once informed of the risks of cross-contamination, their willingness to do so makes them culpable and potentially criminally negligent.	unverifiable
"certainly someone's selfish need to consume peanuts on a plane and consequently placing my daughter's life in jeopardy, does not supersede her ""right to life""!"	unverifiable
foreign carriers must be made to abide by the same rules and regulations as a domestic airlines.	unverifiable
there should no exception to this requirement.	unverifiable
tarmac rules should cover all airports and the time limit should be shortened to 2 hours	unverifiable
yes	unverifiable
90 minutes.	unverifiable
reasons outlined in other submissions.	unverifiable
yes.	unverifiable
dot has checked with homeland security	non-experiential
and it may be possible to deplane delayed or diverted international passengers without cbp screening if passengers are kept in a separate, closed part of the terminal.	non-experiential
i think all passengers should be deplaned  to a specific place or places with access to restrooms and refreshments.	unverifiable
as part of better passenger information about delays, should dot department of transportation also require airlines to specifically inform passengers that they can deplane in situations where the delay is at the gate	unverifiable
yes, to both.	unverifiable
regarding delays.....i think 1 hour prior would be great in case you are running late or trying to decide if you should get a bite to eat before boarding.	unverifiable
this would relieve a lot of stress.	unverifiable
best experience in bad weather would be with jet blue out of kennedy.	unverifiable
twice in the past 3 years i have called the evening before a big storm	experiential
and they gladly changed my flight to the next day with no penalties.	experiential
they said knowing travel conditions would be bad, the fewer flyers on storm day the better.	experiential
so i was extremely happy with that and would like to see all airlines accommodate customers this way.	unverifiable
noting - i didn't cancel my trip, just moved it to the next day	experiential
i had found an open flight before i called.	experiential
lack of space should be at the top of the list of issues the airlines need to address.	unverifiable
whenever you hear about new airliners  they don't mention improved arm and leg room.	unverifiable
i can handle the commuters	unverifiable
because typically you aren't on there long,	non-experiential
but cross country is killer in those economy class seats.	unverifiable
if they were ergonomically designed and comfortable, maybe they would be better,	unverifiable
but they are terrible for lumbar and leg support.	unverifiable
you could probably save space by using more comfortable materials that are slimmer in design.	unverifiable
"even the same leg room with a 3"" wider seat would be great."	unverifiable
maybe a pop up foot rest or block from the floor to rest your feet on.	unverifiable
.air travel has really just become a necessary evil you have to survive.	unverifiable
it's certainly not something enjoyed or eagerly anticipated any longer.	unverifiable
i avoid it if i can and consolidate my trips whenever possible.	unverifiable
i would rather drive 10-12 hours in my car than fly at this point.	unverifiable
disclosure of everything everywhere for at least a year.	unverifiable
also, still having pain, which once was excruciating, from being hit with overhead luggage, i urge charging for overhead storage and not charging for checking.	unverifiable
airlines will save time that way and save the aggravation as people wait for passengers to find places overhead and then fit their luggage in and as flight attendants deal with passengers with oversized bags insisting on carrying them on.	unverifiable
flights will be safer too.	unverifiable
not fair for airline to charge me for checking luggage, then when the hoards of people at the gate are told there is no more room to stow luggage overhead on the plane and that luggage will be checked for free at the gate.	unverifiable
charge everyone for luggage whether it is taken onboard or stowed in the cargo.	unverifiable
it's all about jet fuel anyway.	unverifiable
also the planes would boarded faster if we went back to requiring luggage to be checked to the cargo hold.	unverifiable
i'm tired of having my flight departures delayed by passengers bringing behemoth suitcases onboard the plane.	unverifiable
i've also come close to being injured by people stowing or removing large and heavy bags in the overhead bins.	unverifiable
no more hidden fees.	unverifiable
this is wrong.	unverifiable
i would appreciate getting informed as early as possible, 30 minutes or less.	unverifiable
on my last trip, i had over 5 hours total delay	experiential
"and when i questioned the ground staff, i  received the standard answer of ""i don't know""."	experiential
airlines should be held accountable for the inattentiveness to customer service.	unverifiable
we've had an extensive discussion here about what the airlines are doing wrong when stuff happens and what they should be doing when stuff happens.	unverifiable
we don't see these tarmac delays outside of the us.	unverifiable
baggage fees are a new form of usury and misery.	unverifiable
while i realize that charging the customers individually is more just than adding cost to everyone's ticket,	unverifiable
the whole issue of whether these fees exceed any reasonable need the airlines have to control baggage or are simply a result of greed should be explored.	unverifiable
i would like to see a return to the days when two bags could be checked free, then charges imposed on excess baggage.	unverifiable
i do not understand the rationale for baggage fees except as a means for the airlines to make more money.	unverifiable
this is bait and switch type advertisements.	unverifiable
they want to bait you into their site and then low and behold your ticket at the price you thought you were going to get was not available.	unverifiable
southwest does this and so do all the other carriers.	non-experiential
taxes and fees can be substantial and needs to be included in the fare quoted in advertisements.	unverifiable
the public desperately needs the protection of regulated full disclosure of the total price of a ticket on all advertisements of any kind .	unverifiable
i can't tell you how many times i have committed to an on line ticket purchase i thought was a bargain only to discover a laundry list of undisclosed fees tacked on at a point after i could not back out of the purchase.	unverifiable
"that's like being charged a ""food fee"" in addition to the cost of a meal at a restaurant."	unverifiable
i confess i have not read every item in this string.	experiential
thus i may be out of line.	unverifiable
going on, i have not yet seen anyone address the primary problem- the extended delays themselves.	experiential
couldn't better planning and flight management limit such delays,	unverifiable
which seem now to be more the rule than the exception.	unverifiable
we have simply come to expect that there will be a several hour delay.	unverifiable
dberger - once again we see the attitude of everyone must change for a few, a very few.	unverifiable
this allergy is yours and yours to deal with,	unverifiable
as it is, you have a solution, you take benadryl when you fly. great.	unverifiable
other people need to take other medication to fly as well to deal with their own issues or problems also	unverifiable
which they have no control over.	unverifiable
i say no.	unverifiable
there are steps you can personally take to deal with your own allergy	unverifiable
but instead you insist that everyone else take steps so that you don't have to.	unverifiable
sorry, i'm not accepting that.	unverifiable
hmm, so if people are made aware of the situation you feel discriminated against	unverifiable
seriously, just because the cheaper airfare doesn't ban peanuts that is no excuse to place restrictions on everyone else who flies.	unverifiable
you have children with an allergy that means it is going to cost you in money, time, and diligence in order to protect them to whatever level you deem necessary.	unverifiable
that is your burden.	unverifiable
i have a bad back	experiential
and therefore i do not pack a heavy suitcase when i go somewhere and end up buying some items	experiential
that i otherwise might have carried with me.	unverifiable
that is my burden.	unverifiable
i don't expect you to carry my bags for me so that i can pack more in.	unverifiable
maybe the peanut free flights aren't on an airline i can afford or that is traveling to a place i need to go.	unverifiable
the ada is about equal access-not about what's easy for others.	unverifiable
banning peanut and tree nuts from air travel is not a hard or obtrusive thing to do.	unverifiable
your argument is like the people parking in the  disabled spot for a second as they run in to get the pizza.	unverifiable
it's only for a minute	unverifiable
if someone is going to potentially die because of a food allergy on my flight i'd gladly give up my bag of peanuts or anything else for that matter.	unverifiable
king slav- your ignorance and selfishness is amazing.	unverifiable
i suggested that bumping be limited to reimbursable tickets only and only after passengers have been given time to cancel with penalty.	unverifiable
i do believe the fee for bumped passengers should be increased to match the increase in ticket prices.	unverifiable
all flights should be included in this, with the exception of private charters.	unverifiable
just because it's a small plane doesn't mean it's not inconvenient.	unverifiable
zero fare tickets should be compensated for in the same way they were purchased.	unverifiable
you used miles  you should be reimbursed in miles by the same schedule as people who paid in cash.	unverifiable
airlines also need to re-work their formulas for booking levels to prevent bumping people.	unverifiable
i think there are few people who would change plans for a delay of less then 30 minutes.	unverifiable
heck, it takes me almost an hour to get to the airport as it is.	experiential
and there are times when a 30 minute delay ends up only being 20 minutes.	experiential
now the 1 person who sat at home another 30 minutes might make what would be a 20 minute delay a 30 minute delay.	unverifiable
i think 1 hour would be a better trigger then 30 minutes.	unverifiable
for updates that could be required i think the airlines should allow the customers choose how to be updated.	unverifiable
when booking airfare they can enter email address and phone number and choose if they want a phone call, text message or email about the delay.	unverifiable
refunding fare charges is the best way to deal with lost bags, long delays, cancellations.	unverifiable
these refunds should be unconditional.	unverifiable
do not trap me for over two hours on a plane that is not moving.	unverifiable
if the plane is hot  or cold  take me somewhere comfortable.	unverifiable
treat me, the other passengers, and the crew, as if we were valued as people.	unverifiable
getting where we are going is very important.	unverifiable
so is not getting sick or being terrified for well being.	unverifiable
as a business traveler i need to have someone i can speak with when a delay or cancellation occurs so i can advise clients at the other end of the delay and the opportunity to reschedule the meeting.	unverifiable
being confined in an airplane is too long.	unverifiable
i think the maximum confinement period should be 1 hour at most	unverifiable
and after 20 minutes, passengers should have access to water, lavatories, and standing or moving about.	unverifiable
this should apply to all airlines or airports, any size plane, domestic and international.	unverifiable
i like the idea of advance notice where flights are oversold -	unverifiable
if, say, i check in online 24 hours ahead - it would be nice to be bumped then and rearrange my plans from home rather than the airport.	unverifiable
i think the adjusted limits make more sense than the current limits.	unverifiable
i typically see that everyone bumped from a given flight gets the same compensation, even if the consequences are different -	unverifiable
i'd like to see more clarity on this.	unverifiable
as someone who travels on ff miles with some regularity, my miles are spent for transportation	experiential
and i expect to get where i booked.	unverifiable
if i'm delayed or bumped, i should be compensated in the same way as passengers who paid with cash - perhaps with a tiered system based on the   of points required for the ticket.	unverifiable
most airlines seem to have low mileage, mid-mileage, and high-mileage awards - a three step system to match would make compensation straightforward.	unverifiable
travelers who must wait more than 90 min on the tarmac for takeoff should be allowed to deplane.	unverifiable
passengers on arriving aircraft who must wait for more than 90 min to deplane should be provided with a complimentary free class upgrade on their next flight.	unverifiable
moderator - a classic example above.	unverifiable
don't just ban peanuts,	unverifiable
ban everything that might contain something which may have encountered a peanut or peanut product in it's life.	unverifiable
once you start a ban on one product, you better be prepared for more and more demands to ban a lot of other items.	unverifiable
they're not	non-experiential
because in general they're not morons	unverifiable
and their allergies are not at the level of being deadly.	non-experiential
if your argument is that it might save one life therefore it is worth it, then you better ban flying all together	unverifiable
since more people have died in plane accidents than from peanut allergies.	non-experiential
i can see many sides to this issue as well as other issues that need to be addressed.	unverifiable
in regards to the problems herein, airlines are getting away with charging for things that used to be included.  frankly, i want them to just drop all these extra fees and get back to the simpler times.	unverifiable
charging now for checked bags, pillows, close to the front seating, etc, it is getting out of hand.	unverifiable
now with some airlines getting away with charging for carry-ons, it has gone too far.	unverifiable
passengers have to carry a bag for security of their own money, wallet, keys, tickets, etc.	unverifiable
when i fly, i do not want more to remember to do, such as booking food, and pillows and asking for such things.	unverifiable
the flight attendants are already busy enough, stressed to the max by passengers and the airline they work for already.	unverifiable
we just say one fly off the handle here a few weeks ago,	unverifiable
i don't blame the poor guy,	unverifiable
something happened that pushed him over the edge,	unverifiable
but we don't need more flight attendants feeling over burdened by passengers having to ask for all this stuff.	unverifiable
moreover, as a flyer, frankly i don't want to have to ask for it,	unverifiable
i am already tired,	unverifiable
when i get on board i just want to relax,	unverifiable
flying is already stressful enough.	unverifiable
the airlines need to get back to similar times,	unverifiable
no more charging for these things.	unverifiable
it is not about disclosing them,	unverifiable
although anything they change must be disclosed before hand,	unverifiable
but really, this goes back to my original point,	unverifiable
i don't want more stuff to read, more disclosures to understand, more researching about which airlines do what,	unverifiable
it is enough already,	unverifiable
i cannot handle anymore of this.	unverifiable
the charging of carry-ons is the straw that broke my back	unverifiable
and the reason why i am writing.	unverifiable
i agree with mthornt1 in some respects, and was going to comment about this issue also.	unverifiable
what i notice is that passengers are bringing on suitcases that do not fit in the overhead bins,	unverifiable
those things are hard cased, heavy and frankly too big.	unverifiable
i do not want to see further restrictions in the size of carry-ons,	unverifiable
but i want the airlines to start telling these passengers those suitcases cannot be taken on board.	unverifiable
what makes matters worse is some of these passengers put these big carry ons anywhere they please.	unverifiable
i have watched people who sit in the back stuff their carry on at the front of the plane,	experiential
and the flight attendants are not even paying attention to it.	experiential
when i get on i cannot find a place for my carry on,	experiential
i end up stuffing it under the seat in front of me	experiential
and then i do not have room for my long legs.	experiential
this is another issue,	unverifiable
the planes are too cramped,	unverifiable
there needs to be more pitch between the seats, period!	unverifiable
there is more room on a bus,	unverifiable
and a bus is smaller!	unverifiable
i fly international quite often	experiential
and the situation is made even more difficult through international flights.	unverifiable
if the tickets you hold are not together fees apply here and there and everywhere,	unverifiable
and of course nothing is clear across the board,	unverifiable
and there is no standard.	unverifiable
no more fees, the ticket price you pay includes everything as far as i am concerned.	unverifiable
i do not mind having to pay for a bag that weights over 70lbs,	unverifiable
but do not charge me because i have a bag!	unverifiable
too many changes, let us get back to the basics of air travel.	unverifiable
if everyone respects the rules that are already set up then we won't have any problems.	unverifiable
i do not understand,	unverifiable
obviously, the baggage were found	non-experiential
because they were delivered to the unclaimed luggage center to be sold,	non-experiential
the airlines are actually making a very high profit from all of these 'lost' personal items.	non-experiential
therefore, they have a vested interest to insure that their 'stock' is always available for sale.	unverifiable
in order for there to be stock to fill the shelves then there must be a huge amount of lost luggage.	unverifiable
and if the airlines are making a profit from all of these lost items in order to insure that they continue to maintain their profit they then must purposefully not return lost luggage to their rightful owners and or or intentionally hold on to it and then claim it as being lost.	unverifiable
having a unclaimed luggage store whereby the airlines profit from the loss of other people's personal and valued property is a clear and obvious conflict of interest	unverifiable
and the store needs to be put out of business.	unverifiable
this type of conflict of interest could not, nor would not exit in any other type of industry.	unverifiable
in fact, it would be a violation of law.	non-experiential
the solution:  for every piece of luggage that is lost, no matter the size or content,  the airlines should reimburse the customer $7,000.	unverifiable
this will insure two things:	unverifiable
* the airlines will make every effort to make sure the luggage is returned;	unverifiable
* if the luggage is not returned and instead sold at the unclaimed luggage center then at least the person whose items have been sold will have made some profit from their sale.	unverifiable
any airline that operates into or out of a us airport should be bound by the same rules, whether flights are regularly scheduled or charter.	unverifiable
otherwise, there is unfair competition.	unverifiable
i'm for an outright ban on serving peanuts and peanut products on planes.	unverifiable
i don't have an allergy,	experiential
but i'm amazed at how many people i know who do.	unverifiable
and that population is only growing.	non-experiential
if smoking has been successfully banned, something as potentially deadly as nuts should be.	unverifiable
if someone lights up a cigarette it's not going to cause a medical emergency within moments.	non-experiential
several people opening their nut packets could.	unverifiable
if i want to eat nuts, i'll go home and stuff myself with nuts.	unverifiable
but during a flight, for the safety - not preference - of others, i can refrain.	unverifiable
i think 3 hours is more than enough and should apply to all flights domestic or international period- no if it would disruptive etc.	unverifiable
we've lost most civil rights by being at an airport,	unverifiable
we don't need to be held captive in the ridiculous amount of seat space we're allowed these days.	unverifiable
this should be in the contract of carriage so airlines must commit.	unverifiable
they should also have to tell passengers what the delay is and compensate in most instances.	unverifiable
the fact that an airline didn't get a flight crew there for a scheduled flight shouldn't be my problem.	unverifiable
many years ago, airlines allowed deplaning while fixing mechanical problems.	non-experiential
if people stay within a secure area with food, bathrooms etc, i don't see a problem.	unverifiable
i'm tired of being an airline captive just because they can and will at their whim.	unverifiable
i think it's essential to have functioning restrooms for us old people and sufficient food and water.	unverifiable
any delay is annoying,	unverifiable
but information is critical.	unverifiable
i haven't seen many posts on that.	experiential
tell us why we are being held and when we expect a change.	unverifiable
that info should be updated at least every 30 min.	unverifiable
the airlines require that a companion  be assigned  to children under a certain age for the duration of their travels.	non-experiential
all minors should have additional protections	unverifiable
as they will not be able to stand up and be heard as an adult might.	unverifiable
i have not heard anything about the treatment of minors.	experiential
i have two children with potentially life threatening allergies to peanuts.	experiential
unlike what one person commented, this is not a latest illness fad.	unverifiable
the latest research indicates that peanut allergy doubled in children from 1997 to 2002 and that number continues to increase.	non-experiential
it is one of the most deadly food allergies.	unverifiable
the presence of nuts on planes is a real fear.	unverifiable
while my kids have other potentially deadly food allergies,	experiential
peanuts pose a unique risk.	unverifiable
nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.	non-experiential
peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.	non-experiential
even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.	non-experiential
although epipens can help,	non-experiential
they are not 100% effective and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.	unverifiable
additional steroids, benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.	non-experiential
epipens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.	non-experiential
people still die even with intervention.	non-experiential
please help protect people by offering people the opportunity to get peanut free flights or ban the sale and serving of nut products on the planes.	unverifiable
it would be difficult to justify only addressing peanut allergies and ignore other conditions that threaten the health and well being of passengers.	unverifiable
the affected person should bear the responsibility to know their own condition and to properly prepare for managing it.	unverifiable
airlines should be expected to accommodate special diet requests which are made with adequate prior notice.	unverifiable
in the case of passengers who are not able to manage their own situations, written disclosures to flight personnel should enable flight personnel to institute an appropriate response.	unverifiable
the fda requires labeling for the following 8 allergens:  fish, crustaceans, wheat, eggs, milk, soybeans, tree nuts, peanuts.	non-experiential
a person who claims peanut allergy who does not advocate for banning all 8 allergens is as selfish as the person who opposes banning peanuts on airplanes because they like them.	unverifiable
* cease offering peanut products immediately .	unverifiable
* educate flight crew about the dangers and precautions, including immediate emergency landing even if reaction seems under control	unverifiable
epinephrine does not equal antidote -	non-experiential
i've watched my son rebound with epi and crash again as it wore off, several times.	experiential
* require pax to carry two  doses of epi,	unverifiable
and allow them to pre-board to re-clean.	unverifiable
* inform all pax when an anaphylactic traveler is on board and to kindly refrain from eating crumbly, oily or gooey peanut products, hand out extra towelettes to all pax and encourage use before using common areas, and relocate adjacent obstinant pax if wilfully disregarding the safety of the allergic traveller.	unverifiable
allergic travelers should have two  auto-injectors.	unverifiable
the airline should also have one or two auto-injectors in every first aid kit.	unverifiable
food items prohibited for offer or sale onboard should include any dusty, crumbly, oily or gooey products in which peanuts is an ingredient, as those are the most likely to be transferred or accidentally ingested in sufficient quantities to cause a reaction.	unverifiable
when informed, all pax should be reminded to refrain from eating such products throughout the flight, and to practice extra care and handwashing if they choose to eat them anyway.	unverifiable
that would go a long way to easing my weeks of anxiety before every flight with my anaphylactic son, when air travel is our only option.	unverifiable
none of your examples can result in the death of another passenger.	non-experiential
i don't know whether the regulation should address epipens or not.	unverifiable
i think they should all fall under the same category.	unverifiable
while i have sympathy for people with allergies	unverifiable
i have my own,	experiential
common sense should indicate that you cannot legislate everything.	unverifiable
people need to take responsibility for their own well-being and take whatever precautions are necessary if they decide they must fly.	unverifiable
imposing restrictions on 300 other people for one person does not seem reasonable, or practical.	unverifiable
guess who will pay the extra costs - everyone.	unverifiable
i am allergic to certain perfumes.	experiential
there has to be some common sense.	unverifiable
i am a mother if a three year old with nut  and egg allergies.	experiential
i also support any ban on foods with peanut ingredients on airplanes.	unverifiable
we try to avoid airlines that serve peanuts,	unverifiable
but that is becoming more difficult in this economy where we are trying to save any where we can and airlines are merging.	unverifiable
we have family in europe and used to fly northwest with our son,	experiential
however, since they have merged with delta that is now our least expensive option	non-experiential
we average $2,500 - $3,500 in tickets each time we fly,	experiential
so price does make a difference.	unverifiable
delta serves nuts.	non-experiential
my son did have a reaction on one flights.	experiential
he did not eat nuts, and neither did anyone in our row,	experiential
we believe he came in contact with the nuts from someone who had sat in our seats on a previous flight.	experiential
luckily the reaction was not severe,	unverifiable
we could control it with medicine,	experiential
but when you have a 16 month old reacting at 35,000 feet, it can be very scary.	unverifiable
then next time we flew where the airline served nuts, we told them of the allergy when we bought the tickets and when we checked in.	experiential
i felt very discriminated by a few comments we received from airline personnel.	unverifiable
one flight attendant got angry that he wasn't told in advance and later blamed me when he ran out of non nut snacks when asked for a bag of pretzels	experiential
"they created a ""peanut free area"" around us."	experiential
another flight attendant announced to the plane that they would not be serving nut products because there was a small child with a nut allergy.	experiential
i felt like my family was singled out	unverifiable
because it was a small flight	unverifiable
and we were the only family with a small child.	unverifiable
please change the law to remove nuts from flights,	unverifiable
no child's life is worth the risk.	unverifiable
i think the overriding issue with this industry is that there is no real oversight and they have a lot of rules with no transparency.	unverifiable
i own the ticket, paid for the ticket, etc.	experiential
there is no security threat	unverifiable
that is absolutely unreasonable.	unverifiable
there is no other good or service you can buy that you cannot transfer once you have paid for it.	non-experiential
i am utterly amazed at the ignorance displayed by some of those commenting here.	unverifiable
"allergies are not ""perceived"" as mulder suggests,"	unverifiable
"and it is ridiculous and unrealistic  to suggest that people with severe food allergies ""live in a bubble""."	unverifiable
no one who has an allergy chooses to be in this situation, and walking onto an airplane where peanuts either are being consumed or have been consumed is like playing russian roulette.	unverifiable
we are talking about a snack on an airplane.	non-experiential
as the person would arrive with a ticket in his or her name and have to show id for the ticket.	non-experiential
my son could die because you can't forgo a snack for two hours.	experiential
while we could drive everywhere we need to go for the rest of his life,	experiential
there may come a time when time constraints force us to fly.	non-experiential
"no matter how much ""responsibility we take"", we cannot sufficiently protect him if people around us are eating any peanut product."	unverifiable
we always carry an epi-pen, and feel that should be our responsibility.	experiential
but, again, that may not be enough to save his life.	non-experiential
those auto-injectors can only buy us 10-15 minutes, barely enough time for a plane to request an emergency landing site.	non-experiential
he would be dead before we taxied to the gate.	unverifiable
for a snack!!	unverifiable
an outright ban should be in place.	unverifiable
davew is giving false and misleading information about peanut allergy reactions in-flight.	unverifiable
forty-one of 471 individuals reported allergic reactions to food while on airplanes, including 4 reporting more than 1 reaction.	non-experiential
peanuts accounted for most of the reactions.	non-experiential
twenty-one individuals  treated their reactions during flight.	non-experiential
only 12 individuals  reported the reaction to a flight attendant.	non-experiential
six individuals went to an emergency department after landing, including 1 after a flight diversion.	non-experiential
airline personnel were notified of only 3 of these severe reactions.	non-experiential
comparison of information given to 3 different investigators by airline customer service representatives showed that inconsistencies regarding important information occurred, such as whether the airline regularly serves peanuts.	non-experiential
it seems to be based on the widely held myth that air inside the cabin is recycled;	unverifiable
i.e. that it's the same air you started out with on the ground and just moved around constantly during flight.	non-experiential
not true at all.	non-experiential
cabin air is a mixture of 50% fresh air  and what's already in the cabin.	non-experiential
fresh is is cooled, then ducted throughout the cabin and down into the fuselage, where half of it is vented out;	non-experiential
what remains is then filtered for particulates and other pollutants and mixed with fresh air and the cycle repeats.	non-experiential
the result is that the air in the cabin is cleaner than in most public buildings,	non-experiential
and the air is completely exchanged every 2-3 minutes.	non-experiential
so, if there were peanut dust in the air at any point, it would quickly be filtered out of the air.	non-experiential
banning peanuts, tree nuts, or other items onboard makes no rational sense.	unverifiable
a very small minority of the population has an allergy to peanuts and other nuts,	unverifiable
and this would be allowing a minority to infringe on the rights of the majority.	unverifiable
people with peanut and tree nut allergies can be desensitized to peanuts, as studies have shown.	non-experiential
if they're unwilling to do it, that's not a problem that others should have to compensate for by not being allowed to eat a particular food or snack.	unverifiable
we all take risk every day,	unverifiable
and we accept those risk as part of living.	unverifiable
far more people die each year from drowning  than from peanut allergy reactions ,	non-experiential
yet nobody's advocating that we ban outdoor or indoor pools.	non-experiential
the risk here is being greatly exaggerated for the political gain of a very few people.	unverifiable
the problem of whether to deplane or not is a tricky one.	unverifiable
on one side is the fact that sitting for an excessive amount of time is uncomfortable at best and unhealthy at worst.	unverifiable
however, on the other side there will be considerable time lost with the deplaning and re-boarding.	unverifiable
one item which should be addressed is food and drink.	unverifiable
if the airline would normally have food for the passengers on that flight it seems silly to deny access to anything more than a bag of peanuts and a glass of water.	unverifiable
this happened to my husband last week on a delta flight from newark to amsterdam.	experiential
the passengers were sitting on the plane for over six hours, at the gate,	experiential
but they were only offered one bag of peanuts and a glass of water or orange juice.	experiential
the plane eventually took off at approximately 1 a.m.,	unverifiable
when it should have taken off at 6.40 the previous evening.	experiential
the dinner was not served until the normal point in the flight, somewhere over the atlantic!	experiential
allowing passengers off the plane into a holding area would not give them access to food and drink, but would let them move around.	non-experiential
however, when passengers expect food to be served on a flight they will often depend on that being served	unverifiable
and an excessive delay in serving meals could be hazardous to some people's health, especially when on a connecting flight	non-experiential
so there has been no opportunity to purchase food and drinks at the airport.	non-experiential
you got that right!	unverifiable
the whole anti-peanut movement is the result of hyper-paranoid parents imagining worst case scenarios	unverifiable
and thinking that they have the one child in a billion who actually has a problem with the supposed allergen.	unverifiable
the only way peanuts are going to hurt you is if you choke on them.	non-experiential
i think it is incredibly rude that you will inconvenience an entire plane load of people to avoid mild discomfort.	unverifiable
take benadryl before you fly,	unverifiable
or don't fly.	unverifiable
your watery eyes and itchy throat are not my problem.	unverifiable
i think it's fair to ban airlines from serving packets of peanuts.	unverifiable
if people want peanuts, they can certainly get their own	unverifiable
on southwest you can already request a peanut free flight as far as what they offer	non-experiential
they offer crackers instead.	non-experiential
no.	unverifiable
maybe work to create a peanut free zone,	unverifiable
allow people with allergies to move and or or make the peanut product eating person move.	unverifiable
dust won't spread in that way, making it safer for people who are allergic to peanuts, but without restricting too much the rights of others.	unverifiable
even schools, for example, generally have a place where students can eat their lunch - a peanut free table or something similar.	non-experiential
we need to balance things.	unverifiable
for the record, i have friends with gluten allergies, etc	experiential
if we start regulating food too much, you're going to always be having someone who can't eat anything allowed on the flight due to their own sensitivities.	unverifiable
i don't think airlines need to necessarily serve peanut products.	unverifiable
"if you want peanut stuff, bring it, but you don't have a ""right"" to be served peanuts by the airline."	unverifiable
who have a limited set of foods they can eat, peanut products being one of them.	experiential
i say this as someone with no allergy.	experiential
but banning people from bringing peanut products - especially products that just contain peanuts as one ingredient, not bagged - goes too far.	unverifiable
by the way, once i got off the plane where i was asked to put my personal stash of peanut-containing trail mix away,	experiential
i did some research on airborn food allergy	experiential
because i was skeptical.	unverifiable
dot may want to consider this study supporting reactions to airborne particles of food allergens.	unverifiable
it really doesn't matter what the aafa thinks the ada applies to;	unverifiable
the courts aren't interested.	unverifiable
they need a good body of evidence and reason to convince them,	unverifiable
and they've never seen it yet,	non-experiential
which is why the federal courts have never ruled this way.	unverifiable
yes, breathing is useful if you want to stay alive,	unverifiable
but ada cases apply to employers,	non-experiential
which is why the courts generally rule in favor of the aggrieved employee.	unverifiable
but the ada is limited to employers and those receiving federal funds,	non-experiential
which in the realm of passengers, doesn't apply to an airline.	unverifiable
if we start to view allergies as a disability, then everyone is disabled,	unverifiable
and that is absolute nonsense.	unverifiable
i've never questioned the severity of peanut allergies;	unverifiable
"i do take issue with the idea that is being pushed that these sufferers are ""disabled"" and that they should be able to determine what can and cannot be served or eaten on-board an airline, to the detriment of the majority view."	unverifiable
but their mindset is to imagine the worst possible scenario and take the position that it is a certainty.	unverifiable
it substitutes imagination for thinking, speculation for risk analysis, and fear for reason.	unverifiable
it fosters powerlessness and vulnerability...	unverifiable
that's not how they should want to live their life, nor should anyone else.	unverifiable
the fact that nobody has ever died from anaphylactic shock caused by peanuts or tree nuts on-board a u.s. flight is very relevant and significant.	unverifiable
it provides us with irrefutable, unbiased, empirical evidence of exactly how remote this possibility is for anyone.	unverifiable
decision need to be based on evidence, not speculation or fear.	unverifiable
if we were to get in the time machine and go back to august 2001, i'd say skip the theatrics at the airport and do some real intelligence gathering, just like the israeli's.	unverifiable
body scanners don't work, which is why they and other countries don't use them.	unverifiable
"on the ground intelligence works and is far less expensive than a ""homeland security"" department with an endless, secret budget, accountable to no one, rife with abuse and waste of taxpayer dollars, along with secret policies and programs that violate longstanding federal laws as well as our constitutional rights."	unverifiable
for all the inconvenience you endure at the airport, it hasn't increased security one bit.	unverifiable
it just makes people think it's safer.	unverifiable
that's a delusion for which nobody should take pride.	unverifiable
we haven't been lucky at all;	unverifiable
terrorists, for all their boasting, are generally inept and stupid.	unverifiable
likewise, there's no evidence that allergy sufferers are choosing not to travel by air due to their imagined fear.	non-experiential
that's a position that faan and aafa would like the dot and others to believe,	unverifiable
but if they had any scientific data to back it up, they would have trotted it out by now.	unverifiable
peanut and tree nut allergy suffers aren't forced to not fly;	unverifiable
that's something they choose out of an irrational fear of the unknown.	unverifiable
choosing not to participate in life to the fullest extend you can is not a disability.	unverifiable
it's you giving your condition too much influence over what you can or cannot do.	unverifiable
i don't support having airlines offer gloves or cleanroom suits for severe allergy sufferers;	unverifiable
they solve nothing and are very expensive, which would result in an increase in the cost of travel for everyone.	unverifiable
there's nothing to stop people from bringing their own supply of surgical masks, just like they used during the sars scare,	unverifiable
and some people even used during the overwrought fear of contracting h5n1 .	unverifiable
those are very effective at preventing inhalation of dust and airborne bacteria.	unverifiable
weight is the excuse for charging a fee to improve revenue.	unverifiable
"in general the airlines average what a ""typical"" load of baggage and people weighs and how much that adds to the amount of fuel required for a flight."	non-experiential
they do not weigh each aircraft prior to take off	non-experiential
so you don't have any good numbers to back up the need for a fee for more bags or for heavier people.	unverifiable
i weigh 250 lbs	experiential
as for the disclosure...yes,	unverifiable
airlines should disclose what it costs to take a flight with them	unverifiable
and it should be easy to find, read and understand.	unverifiable
after that it's up to the customer to actually find and read it before they pay for it.	unverifiable
because using the logic offered by the above commenters , the answers to all these questions should be yes -	unverifiable
yet we can see this quickly becomes absurd.	unverifiable
peanut allergies are not increasing,	non-experiential
so it's time you get that idea out of your head.	unverifiable
there is no scientific evidence to support that tired, old claim.	non-experiential
smoking on an airliner can indeed cause a medical emergency within moments.	non-experiential
people opening packages of peanuts cannot;	non-experiential
it's never happened on any u.s. based flight in all the years of airlines operating.	non-experiential
that alone is ample evidence that the possibility is so remote as to be statistically non-existent.	unverifiable
people who subscribe to worst-case scenario thinking are creating needless anxiety for themselves and others, which leaves them feeling powerless and vulnerable.	unverifiable
instead of trying to shift your irrational fears onto others along with your responsibility for your own condition, get professional help.	unverifiable
in this discussion many mention a 'slippery slope' - extending to examples  of banning of perfume, latex, body oder, etc.	unverifiable
this point is interesting,	unverifiable
the clear sort of first order response you would expect would be to protect the livelihood  or  convenience of the sensitive members of our society.	unverifiable
i would argue, however, that there is a more dangerous unintended consequence inherent in removing the responsibility of these individuals to be so cautious and concerned for their own safety;	unverifiable
by promoting an 'allergen free' environment you dilute individual responsibility by distributing the liability evenly to those who travel with the allergic individual.	unverifiable
you can't search everyone's bag for explosives  or  sharp objects  or  and peanuts.	non-experiential
you cannot ensure that everyone will read signs and participate willingly.	unverifiable
in my opinion, the question of a ban is absurd.	unverifiable
i would gladly forgo my allotment of peanuts to preserve someone else's comfort -	unverifiable
but you're not going to find any solidarity among a random sample of individuals.	unverifiable
so i would assert that the most reasonable solution is that allergic people remain guarded in their own concern as this is the situation in which the most value will be generated to motivate proper management.	unverifiable
their steadfast concern for their own health, or that of a loved one will generate the safest environment for everyone involved.	unverifiable
rather than debating where peanuts should and shouldn't be, i believe we would be better off investing this energy in trying to find ways to help people better manage their own allergies.	unverifiable
this situation  does not mandate legislation -	unverifiable
but instead reveals that we aren't yet properly equipped  to allow these members of our society a comfortable  or  regular life.	unverifiable
i suffer from a tree nut allergy, with sensitivity to peanuts.	experiential
like anyone who has an anaphylactic allergy, i always carry my epi-pen and benedryl everywhere i go.	experiential
i always get nervous when flying at the thought of going into anaphylactic shock mid-air, and believe that something needs to be done to protect people with true food allergies.	unverifiable
i think to start, serving peanuts should be banned.	unverifiable
the degree of the allergy varies from person to person,	non-experiential
but banning the actual product would help a lot of people right away.	unverifiable
food that might be shared on the same equipment or may contain nuts should still be allowed to respect the other side's rights.	unverifiable
i also think there should be peanut free seating on planes that are priority to people with allergies.	unverifiable
that would eliminate the chance of my neighbor eating nuts.	unverifiable
it's a tough subject to debate.	unverifiable
maybe airlines should ask when purchasing a ticket as to whether or not they are traveling with someone who has an allergy.	unverifiable
based on answers, they can then plan for seating accordingly.	unverifiable
some baseball stadiums have peanut free sections,	non-experiential
and airplanes should too!	unverifiable
i would guess that in general, people either do their research, or don't care enough about it.	unverifiable
as an outsider to the airline industry, it is hard for me to say what level of cleaning currently occurs on an aircraft.	unverifiable
obviously, on quick turnaround layovers, flight crews only have time for a cursory cleaning.	non-experiential
i don't know.	unverifiable
the rule probably has the best chance of being enacted if it minimizes overall cost to the airline industry while meeting the desired safety requirements.	unverifiable
personally, i would be satisfied if the rule simply called for removal of peanuts from aircraft and allowed the airlines to put forth a good faith effort at cleaning their fleets.	unverifiable
auto-injection of epinephrine is not a guarantee the a severe reaction will be diminished and fatality avoided.	non-experiential
it's an additive measure to the most important precaution: avoiding the allergen.	unverifiable
one can argue that allergic individuals should take care, avoid known allergens, etc.	unverifiable
i work non-stop to educate my young child regarding her peanut and other allergies.	experiential
she is knowledgeable and self-advocates,	unverifiable
but that in and of itself does not prevent accidents.	unverifiable
if switching from peanuts or tree nuts to something more benign saves even one life, then it will have been worth the inconvenience to all those that insist their constitutional rights to in-flight peanuts not be trampled upon.	unverifiable
small children and the severely allergic need this in-flight peanut or peanut products ban the most.	unverifiable
stronger penalties and contingency plans are separate issues.	unverifiable
contingency plans are just that, they cover a broader array of situations that are likely to occur.	unverifiable
stronger penalties don't appear to address all the issues.	unverifiable
contingency plans for a broader set of situations.	unverifiable
perhaps the corner cases might not be included but i think there are more situations that need to be worked through.	unverifiable
then again, maybe a blanket rule of three hours would be better since there could be no confusion...	unverifiable
three hours is three hours regardless of the situation.	unverifiable
if the airlines have to charge for checked bags and even carry on bags, it should be included in the price of the ticket.	unverifiable
if a passenger has no checked bags then they should be able to choose that option and get the exact ticket price the same way a person with a checked bag should be able to see the actual ticket price.	unverifiable
you are either in business or guaranteed profit.	unverifiable
you cannot have it both ways.	unverifiable
every business has its risks and good management deals with it accordingly.	unverifiable
passing those risks on to your customers in inappropriate.	unverifiable
once a purchase is completed a contract is in effect.	non-experiential
"on the other hand, if customers are provided the right to cancel according to their self-determined ""drastic""  circumstances with a full and immediate refund i might think differently."	unverifiable
in general, i think that blanket policies on this topic would be a bad idea,	unverifiable
because people have varying capacities to handle travel.	unverifiable
for example, the first time i ever flew without a parent , i was 7 years old,	experiential
and i went with my older brother who was 10.	experiential
we flew from chicago to colorado with no incident.	experiential
however, that doesn't mean that every 7 or 10 year old can handle it-many can't, and shouldn't try.	unverifiable
it's something that the parents themselves should decide,	unverifiable
because they know their children better than the airlines do.	unverifiable
"also, be careful when talking about ""minors"" flying alone on airplanes."	unverifiable
i didn't turn 18 until i was already a sophomore in college-	experiential
different airlines will treat this issue differently.	unverifiable
applying a blanket policy will take away the options that come in an open marketplace of ideas.	unverifiable
"if i only had one option, because every airline was required to treat ""minors"" in the same manner, my travel choices would have been limited, not expanded."	unverifiable
this is a really interesting solution.	unverifiable
first, the largest airports, which experience the largest number of delays, may be located in urban areas in which airport expansion is not as feasible.	non-experiential
i grew up in chicago and traveled out of midway and o'hare, airports that are surrounded by city and suburbs.	experiential
second, if an airport were to commit some of its finite space to a delay terminal, that space would have to be first taken from another part of the airport, leaving less room for active planes.	non-experiential
to me, this sounds like it would limit the number of flights at large airports, making them less competitive and possibly increasing prices.	unverifiable
however, i find your idea very creative, and much better than the majority of the solutions to these problems.	unverifiable
regina i haven't noticed many people specifically saying they wanted inexpensive airline travel,	experiential
although certainly that would be desirable.	unverifiable
what i hear is that people are tired of being shabbily and unethically treated and often being cheated when the airline doesn't follow through on their stated policies about lost baggage and other similar items and when the airlines make significant flight changes to the detriment of the passenger with no leniency or compensation.	unverifiable
if the airlines were regulating themselves and were treating their customers ethically and courteously there would not be this urgent need for more regulation.	unverifiable
as a 75k-mile annual flyer, i travel a lot.	experiential
i've seen plenty of rules be flouted,	experiential
and this one just begs for it.	unverifiable
the real danger here is lulling peanut allergy suffers into false sense of security.	unverifiable
under a ban, an airline might eliminate all peanut-related items from their snacks,	non-experiential
but pax may bring onboard peanut-related items.	non-experiential
and if the potential for peanut residue to become airborne exists, then the ban will be for naught if pax privately bring their own.	unverifiable
this will, of course, lead to lawsuts against airlines,	unverifiable
who have no real way of enforcing a ban against pax who bring the stuff onboard.	non-experiential
my concern here is that the airlines will become scapegoats for the misdeeds of private individuals.	unverifiable
the ban should not be put into effect.	unverifiable
plenty of people are severely allergic to any nuts or nut-related products, with complications including death.	non-experiential
while i feel for the allergy sufferers	unverifiable
my nephew is one such young man, to such a degree that he is at risk of dying should he even touch a nut,	experiential
they are simply the leading edge of a complete ban on everything onboard planes.	unverifiable
say no to this ban.	unverifiable
allergy sufferers, please bring that epi-pen,	unverifiable
or if your allergy is so serious, please do not fly.	unverifiable
"i have been the victim of a scam by a major airline - in which they ""cancel"" an over-booked flight by changing its departure time by a few minutes, then involuntarily put me on a different  flight, with no notice and no compensation."	experiential
"luckily, i showed up at the airport early and was able to make my ""new"" flight, which was a couple of hours earlier than my original."	experiential
they denied any compensation for my inconvenience, of course.	experiential
and when i contacted dot, they told me that i could submit a complaint, but that they did not enforce airline compliance to federal rules.	experiential
"another time, i had booked a round trip to europe and was notified by the airline that they had cancelled the return flight i had booked - ""we're not flying that route that day of the week anymore"" -"	experiential
well, they were at the time i booked the flight!	experiential
as far as i am concerned, they had entered into a bargain when i booked the flight,	experiential
and should be held accountable for keeping the bargain or providing compensation -	unverifiable
i called, and they refused any compensation whatsoever -	experiential
"even though the ""new"" return flight would require my staying an additional night in amsterdam , and an additional stop with long layover to get home."	experiential
one is that airlines be required to keep their end of a bargain made when a ticket is purchased, or be required to pay compensation.	unverifiable
simple as that.	unverifiable
the other comment is that dot actually enforce the rules they make for airline operation.	unverifiable
as far as i've been told, in the situations i've described, the airlines comply with rules at their own discretion.	unverifiable
sure, you can complain, but it does no good.	unverifiable
i would like to be able to file a complaint with dot and have some enforcement take place rather than having to go to court.	unverifiable
i fully agree with nearly all the comments made here about baggage and other fees -	unverifiable
and i know from having talked to them, that flight attendants hate the checked baggage charges too -	unverifiable
it makes for delays in boarding times and a hassle for them to find room for all the carry-ons.	unverifiable
the airlines management - the suits with the spreadsheets - simply don't care.	unverifiable
the airlines are only one example of corporate america, which in recent years feels free to thumb its collective nose at its customers.	unverifiable
they know full well that their employees and their customers hate the baggage charges.	unverifiable
they simply don't care.	unverifiable
there should be no charge for one checked bag and one carry-on - with an additional item such as a purse or briefcase.	unverifiable
all carry-ons should be compliant with size limitations -	unverifiable
which is not done now.	non-experiential
also - when buying a ticket and selecting a seat - one some aircraft there are some seats that have some sort of box bolted to the floor supports on the seat in front,	non-experiential
which greatly restricts the room you have to put a carry-on under the seat in front of you, even if it's within size limits for carry-ons.	non-experiential
"when these seats are offered online, or through a travel agent - the airline should include the information: ""restricted room for under-seat storage of luggage."""	unverifiable
30 minutes seems reasonable -	unverifiable
how hard can it be to set up a system that updates the website and the automated phone system  as soon as a delay is known.	unverifiable
and if that information system can't handle it then it should be fixed.	unverifiable
actually i read a lot about dying here	experiential
"i know that the ""estimates"" are that .6 to 1.5% of the us population may be allergic to peanuts."	non-experiential
"and i found the following in a story ""in 2004, the centers for disease control cited just 14 deaths due to anaphylaxis."	non-experiential
the only known registry of deaths from anaphylaxis noted 33 deaths between 1994 and 1999.	non-experiential
"remember, all of these estimates refer to the total number of people who had an anaphylactic reaction for any reason, not just from peanuts or other foods."""	non-experiential
but i have yet to find anything i can pin down that says how many people really die from a peanut allergy each year.	experiential
to me it seems pretty obvious that people with peanut allergies do fly	non-experiential
and yet as far as i can tell no one has died.	non-experiential
in my opinion, three hours is the maximum amount of time that planes should be allowed to stay on the tarmac before taking off or returning to a gate, whether the flight is domestic or international.	unverifiable
two or two and a half hours would be better.	unverifiable
it's true that if you end up back at the gate after a long spell on the tarmac, you will probably find yourself in a long line waiting to be rebooked.	unverifiable
but at least you won't be stuck in a cramped metal tube that might not have air conditioning, water, or working bathrooms.	unverifiable
the reason being is that you are international and they do not enforce it cause it is not a domestic flight in and around the us.	non-experiential
when i said it should be made crystal clear to the customer that it is his or her responsibility to make the flight, i meant it.	unverifiable
if the airline graciously lets customers out, it's the customer's job to get back on, just as if the flight is making its original departure.	unverifiable
i do not believe airlines of any size should be allowed to oversell tickets.	unverifiable
let them quote a price to the traveler and offer the option to be on standby.	unverifiable
if bumping must exist, there should be no caps on compensation and zero fare ticket passengers should be entitled to the same compensation of other passengers.	unverifiable
compensation at the cost of a full, last minute fare hardly seems extreme to me given the expensive consequences can have to a traveler.	unverifiable
i think airlines of all sizes at all airports should be required to allow passengers to stow in cargo one large suitcase for free and carry on one small suitcase for free.	unverifiable
i do not believe the airline should be allowed to charge fees for access to water or lavatories or light or air or electricity.	unverifiable
if the airline is going to charge extra fees for anything a passenger may need while traveling, it should be clearly stated at the point where a quote for the airline ticket fare is quoted.	unverifiable
there should be no need to wander anywhere else on the airline's site.	unverifiable
state it up front and obvious so the traveler can make an informed choice.	unverifiable
all flights with more than 15 passenger seats ought to provide update information within 30 minutes.	unverifiable
on a small plane out of springfield, no notice was provided about delay until i got to the airport.	experiential
that did not give me enough time to make alternative arrangements to catch my next flight.	unverifiable
i definitely agree with making full fare information available and advertising one way fares when indeed it refers to one way, not round trip.	unverifiable
for any airline or travel agent or booking site that treats optional services as op-in sham on you!	unverifiable
whenever a borrower communicates with their loan servicer in regards to any and all insurance related matters, they are actually speaking to the insurance tracker  whose representatives state that they are actually the loan servicer.	non-experiential
in the event of a claim, if a borrower is unhappy with the resolution from the force-placed insurer, they will call the loan servicer, who will transfer them to the insurance tracker, who is acting as the loan servicer, but is actually the force-placed insurer.	non-experiential
this is such an illegal conflict of interest it'd be funny if it weren't true.	unverifiable
if a partial payment is made, the representatives for the loan service should be trained in all escrow matters so they can inform the customer that the partial payment will create an escrow shortage that can lead to placement of force-placed insurance, nonpayment of property taxes, and denial of a loan modification...all of which lead to foreclosure.	unverifiable
another issue during the foreclosure sale is the placement of real estate owned  insurance,	unverifiable
which protects only the loan servicer and not the borrower.	non-experiential
these premiums are always charged directly to the borrower's escrow account	non-experiential
one is created for non-escrow liens.	non-experiential
when a borrower pulls out of foreclosure, they are then held responsible for reo premiums that did not have them listed as the beneficiary on the policy.	non-experiential
if the foreclosure is sold, the escrow balance is rolled into the balance of the loan.	non-experiential
either way, the loan servicer and force-placed insurer force these post-foreclosure reo policies to renew monthly on a borrower's account.	non-experiential
the law may not require lenders to offer modifiations	non-experiential
but it certainly does require lenders to treat all similarly situated parties the same.	non-experiential
the mortgage industry issued over 5 million negative equity modifications to avoid the investor losses proven by the mathematical result of a andnpv setting their own new precedent what is the new course of business.	unverifiable
every homeowner with a loan to value of 80% of greater is legally, ethically and morally entitled to a similar financial advantage, capitalism and the law.	unverifiable
for more information see the petition located at unitedinprosperity.org	unverifiable
the statement needs to include an escrow breakdown.	unverifiable
there is plenty of space on this document to include it,	non-experiential
and i don't understand why this is not being addressed.	unverifiable
this escrow breakdown should state what insurance information is on file for the property, the expiration date, and premium.	unverifiable
it should also include a tax breakdown, pmi, and any other fees, along with an escrow balance.	unverifiable
if a borrower has an escrow account open in their name, they have a right to know the balance and why.	unverifiable
this is all very simple information for loan servicers to provide.	unverifiable
as for passing the costs on to consumers, i completely disagree.	unverifiable
if the current servicers can't handle the financial burden, then maybe they need to sell their servicing portfolios to companies who are equipped to handle it.	unverifiable
there are plenty of companies who can step up.	unverifiable
i'm sorry,	unverifiable
"but it's long been time we stopped babying these ""too large to fail"" institutions and let capitalism run its natural course."	unverifiable
it's called survival of the fittest.	unverifiable
it's minimal.	non-experiential
they already have and store this  historical information for a minimum of 6 months.	non-experiential
it's all built into the systems.	non-experiential
even if something needed to change, it wouldn't be the servicer changing it.	unverifiable
they don't have the capability.	non-experiential
it would be the fidelity powercell handling this change and or or providing training.	unverifiable
i don't think there should be a small servicer exception.	unverifiable
large or small, mortgage servicing should remain the same.	unverifiable
look at a restaurant, for example.	unverifiable
when i walk down the street, i can go to mcdonald's or a hole in the wall.	non-experiential
my reasons for choosing one or the other are my own,	unverifiable
but regardless of where i decide to eat, the transaction is the same.	non-experiential
they present me with a menu,	non-experiential
i give them my money,	non-experiential
they give me a receipt.	non-experiential
the sample form is a working draft i hope.	unverifiable
keep working towards streamline, and developing a matrix or table form that presents the information that the consumer cares about most.	unverifiable
i'm not understanding.	unverifiable
the main problem with hamp and the other programs is that they are voluntary on the part of the servicers and banks.	unverifiable
these programs need to be mandatory.	unverifiable
the taxpayers bailed out the banks.	non-experiential
now the banks need to bailout the taxpaying homeowners.	unverifiable
every single rule is catering to the servicer, not the consumer.	unverifiable
if these rules are implemented you don't even need to worry about writing a qwr.	unverifiable
might as well reverse respa law.	unverifiable
if they can give answers orally they can lie.	unverifiable
and they do lie,	non-experiential
believe me.	unverifiable
i have these lies in writing	experiential
and it is the only way i can hold them accountable.	unverifiable
there definitely needs to be rules stating that a borrower is never saddled with reo fees.	unverifiable
this is one of many reasons escrow accounts need to be transparent on a bill.	unverifiable
people need to be able to see what they're being charged,	unverifiable
or fees like reo will continue to be illegally added to their accounts.	unverifiable
as far as i was aware, emails are free to send en masse.	non-experiential
the loan servicing software used already produces delinquency reports.	non-experiential
that's how a servicers know to foreclose in the first place.	non-experiential
there would be a one-time resource cost to pay somebody for the hour it would take to draft or approve a generic email,	non-experiential
but the cfpb is providing most of these templates anyway.	non-experiential
if someone were available consistently and knew what to do and how to help, it would relieve stress, mental anguish and perhaps solve the problem before needing other intervention.	unverifiable
the need for continuity of contact is described exactly in the opening paragraph.	non-experiential
i can't tell you, but have documented the almost daily calls that require me to repeat the same information then am told that someone else from another department will be in touch because the caller is not the right office.	experiential
there ought to be a law.	unverifiable
continuity of contact is a good start.	unverifiable
i do think that it would have helped if these rules had been in place.	unverifiable
rules are great if they are regulated and followed.	unverifiable
we can create rules all we want along with fines,	unverifiable
but in the end if they are not followed and consequences are not served, they will just continue to take advantage of distressed homeowners.	unverifiable
the lenders are still filing inaccurate paperwork and by falsifying and forging paperwork.	non-experiential
money fines are not going to do it.	unverifiable
they are wealthy individuals and corporations	non-experiential
and i don't see that money fines are going to make a difference to them.	unverifiable
they will just pay the fine and move on.	unverifiable
they need to serve jail time.	unverifiable
they may be very wealthy individuals,	non-experiential
but in the end, they are no different then you or i.	non-experiential
they eat the same kinds of foods, put their clothes on the same way.	non-experiential
yet, if i did something like this, they would not hesitate to prosecute me and i have no doubt that i would be in jail for a very long time.	unverifiable
without some type of jail time, they will not correct their behavior.	unverifiable
i have been a negotiator that assists homeowners with their homes for the last 2.5 years and was working with homeowners and the banks before the settlement as well as after the settlement,	experiential
and i can tell you that nothing has changed.	experiential
the lenders do not call back,	non-experiential
they are always loosing documents.	non-experiential
and you cannot get a response in 30 days even if your life depended upon it,	non-experiential
but again, nothing is being done.	non-experiential
i am sure he mortgage settlement has done some good for many homeowners,	unverifiable
but for many it has not.	unverifiable
but yet, you don't hear about the lenders or servicers receiving any fines or even jail time.	unverifiable
they need to be prosecuted in court just like everyone else or else they will continue the same behavior.	unverifiable
make some rules that make sense and hold them accountable.	unverifiable
you are on the right track with what has been done,	unverifiable
but we are far from there.	unverifiable
we will never get there if the servicers and lenders are not prosecuted for violating the laws.	unverifiable
the letter should also state which servicer is responsible for making payments from any escrow account for property taxes and property insurance and the effective date.	unverifiable
further, it would be good if it gave the website address for the new servicer for account information and gave the proper address  or  flow for electronic payments .	unverifiable
"reason - 1 i had a bad experience once when the servicer did not make a timely property tax payment which ""slipped through the cracks""."	experiential
2 customers need to know how to handle and timing of changes to regularly scheduled electronic mortgage payments.	unverifiable
i would like to see the lenders answering orally and sending an confirming letter or email at the borrower's option.	unverifiable
if they can't answer immediately on the phone, then in addition to having to respond in writing to the question, they should have to confirm in writing the question and that they are working on obtaining the answer within a specific time frame.	unverifiable
there is a system by which housing counselors can upload documents electronically to many of the major servicers	unverifiable
* that, at least, eliminates one source of frustration.	unverifiable
gmac mortgage has just started allowing homeowners to upload their own docs.	unverifiable
see the website:	unverifiable
hopefully, this will expand.	unverifiable
having a single-point-of-contact  at the servicer is a step in the right direction,	unverifiable
but there is still a quick turn-over  and often a lack of experience and knowledge on their part.	unverifiable
first, i don't think it is appropriate to call people names,	unverifiable
and your disrespect of the president is in poor taste.	unverifiable
now, as a servicer you are directly involved with the business side of what has happened.	unverifiable
many of your counterparts have, and continue to engage in outrageous behaviors that have affected millions of homeowners.	unverifiable
the mortgage service industry has been engaging in acts from predatory to outright fraud.	unverifiable
you might be small bank,	unverifiable
but your bretheren are to blame for bringing shame to your industry.	unverifiable
"it is not a ""few"" cases here and there,"	unverifiable
it is systematic.	unverifiable
"so go yell at the servicers who turned your industry into the most untrusted ""service"" this nation has ever seen."	unverifiable
the public does not trust you anymore.	unverifiable
the government has to step in	unverifiable
because your industry proved it could not self-regulate,	unverifiable
it could only pillar, plunge and abuse.	unverifiable
maybe not your bank, but plenty of others did and still do.	unverifiable
the cfpb was created because of the conduct of mortgage servicers.	unverifiable
if your counterparts had been acting in good faith, the cfpb would have never been created.	unverifiable
the mortgage service industry needs to take a hard look in the mirror, and start giving service back instead of trying to take advantage of the american public.	unverifiable
the old servicer should be required to send any payments recieved during the 60 day period directly to the new servicer without any penalty or late charge.	unverifiable
if the old servicer is given the option of sending it back to the borrower, the borrower will most likely now incur a late charge with the new servicer.	unverifiable
"the ""send it back to the borrower"" should not be an option and should be stricken."	unverifiable
"also the the wording ""mistakenly or accidently"" sent to the old servicer should be revised as well."	unverifiable
the borrower should be able to pay the old servicer during the 60 day period without fear.	unverifiable
i have such issue with a new servicer, who refuses to send any information about the loan.	experiential
no, the old servicer should still except payments,	unverifiable
this may be a window to resolve disputes with the new servicer before the borrower makes payments to them.	unverifiable
labeling one as a stooge or a dupe is not calling names.	unverifiable
it is assessing the level of the comment.	unverifiable
you are ignoring the point and throwing out a non-starter as a means to win a debate.	unverifiable
it is your arguments that are as berift of substance as the atacama desert is berift of water.	unverifiable
answer that with a reasonable degree of clarity and persuasive arguement	unverifiable
then you will have others listen to you.	unverifiable
i think the form is a great start.	unverifiable
i suggest  making the the items that propose the alternatives i.e. refinance, modification etc. to be placed in bold as well	unverifiable
because they are important options.	unverifiable
2 reminding consumers that there are various websites, such as bankrate.com that can give them information about prevailing rates.	unverifiable
3 putting a representative pict of a posted libor rate from wsj.	unverifiable
finally i suggest putting as many explanatory items in bullet form instead of paragraph form.	unverifiable
while a coupon book is not appropriate for every person or type of loan, some borrowers like having a physical book.	unverifiable
not everyone is tech savy.	unverifiable
consumers are already challenged in their efforts to get the credit reporting agencies to resolve errors on their credit report.	unverifiable
"one of the main reasons for this is the failure of the fair credit reporting act to define ""reasonable investigation""."	unverifiable
i would hate to see the same problem repeated in the rule making for mortgage servicers.	unverifiable
"i believe it would beneficial for the new rules to provide a minimum definition of ""reasonable investigation"""	unverifiable
so there is no room for ambiguity or conflicting expectations.	unverifiable
"terms like ""unreasonable volume of documents..."" or ""unduly burdensome..."" or ""unreasonable costs..."" without specific definitions will foster a virtual loop hole for servicers so avoid responding to consumer requests for information by simply making a subjective decision that the consumer's request is ""unreasonable"" ""overburdensome"" etc."	unverifiable
once again it leaves the consumer without any real teeth to get results.	unverifiable
also, the limitation of 1 year after loan was transferred or paid off is too short of a period of time.	unverifiable
currently, many consumers are not made aware of the error until they seek to buy a new home oftentimes many years later.	unverifiable
"the credit reporting of the mortgage loan is often done so with errors such as a reported ""foreclosure"" or ""paid for less than full balance"" or "" settled"" when that may not be the case."	unverifiable
it may be several years before the consumer is made aware of the error.	unverifiable
many regulated industries require entities to maintain records for 7 years.	unverifiable
why not allow the consumer 7 years to request information.	unverifiable
this would be consistent with the time period for credit reporting of most inaccurate credit items.	unverifiable
maybe the answer is to have the consumer set up their account with an email alert.	unverifiable
most of the larger servicers offer internet access to your account, so set up the alert.	unverifiable
if this is left to the servicer to send emails, i can just see the next round.	unverifiable
say a couple gets divorced,	unverifiable
the servicer only has the wife's email address,	unverifiable
she is not happy doesn't inform husband who is living in the house.	unverifiable
husband sues servicer for no contact via email.	unverifiable
we all need to take a deep breath and realize that the consumer has to take some responsiblity here.	unverifiable
if you know you house payment is due and the 1st and you don't pay it - your late!	unverifiable
and don't forget not everyone has a computer or cares to get one, what to do about them,	unverifiable
at least sending a notice in writing is keeping the postal service somewhat alive.	unverifiable
where the note and mortgage are missing the bank should not be allowed to report to the credit bureau.	unverifiable
the credit reporting agency should not be based on the hear say of a bankster.	unverifiable
this is unethical and unfair.	unverifiable
this would leave a lot of people with good credit where they can buy a new home again because of bank fraud and irresponsibility.	unverifiable
and there is no place for the homeowner to report on the banks fraud, racketeering, pay to play, empty insurance shells set up for billing etc...	unverifiable
so the bank can not loan money any more.	unverifiable
in a fair society, this would be working both ways, the same.	unverifiable
this has to change!	unverifiable
then on the front of aol and huffington post, put a link to where the cfpb is asking for your voice to be heard, with additional  mortgage solutions and a link to your site.	unverifiable
go on cnn and provide your link and tell about the program and read some of the good ideas you are already receiving.	unverifiable
unless this has only been set up for a few days there are not very many comments and lack of exposure will lead to minimum results, instead of maximum results.	unverifiable
blog it and put up articles all over the web.	unverifiable
again your success will be based on using all cutting edge computer technology.	unverifiable
cutting edge computer technology is the answer to most of the problems.	unverifiable
"also, banks say ""this call may be recorded for quality ...."""	unverifiable
"why not require the bank to change this to ""both parties are allowed to record this call for quality assurance"""	unverifiable
this will change a lot of the banks bad behavior with a couple of words on a recording.	unverifiable
simple solution to a huge problem.	unverifiable
bravo steve bravo!!!	unverifiable
you spell it it very well.	unverifiable
there are servicers whose conduct is reprehensible, nothing short of a lawsuit will bring any form of accountability.	unverifiable
the rules and regulations protection consumers are already weak,	unverifiable
and the proposed changes weaken the consumers position further in many ways.	unverifiable
servicers are not above lying,	unverifiable
they do it every day.	unverifiable
i guess the rulemakers can no seem to grasp what is really going on,	unverifiable
but your story of being directed to a defunct loan originator is another example of their deceptive practices.	unverifiable
none of the rules will fix that though...	unverifiable
to show you what is really happening, please got to:	unverifiable
this shows you how rotten this servicer really is.	unverifiable
"maybe the moderators can look at this and see where the borrowers are coming from rather than focusing on the ""impact"" to the servicers."	unverifiable
nationstar is as corrupt as thet come, and these rules do nothing to give the borrowers real power to fight back.	unverifiable
i run a very small bank	experiential
and we keep every loan we make.	experiential
all banks must provide you with a form that tells if they plan on selling your loan.	non-experiential
if you don't want your loan sold and would like to have a relationship with a loan officer, they i would like to suggest using a small bank.	unverifiable
it accually works.	unverifiable
i have been dealing with the same customers for 30 years and have serviced all of their loan needs for that long.	unverifiable
remember, rate is not everything.	unverifiable
you get what you pay for, just know what your getting before you sign.	unverifiable
the borrower should certainly know that a partial payment is not credited to their benefit if that is the case.	unverifiable
i have better uses for those funds  or i can put them in a savings account.	unverifiable
if payment was tendered, even a partial payment, the borrower was attempting to fulfill his or her obligation and should receive some credit for the attempt.	unverifiable
it has been my experience that consumers who are encouraged to work with their lenders often do a better job of fulfilling their obligations.	unverifiable
as for the recordkeeping issue for servicers of the accounts, my guess would be that partial payments could be programmed into the bookkeeping program and the allocations made automatically or nearly so.	unverifiable
the additional time would be minimal compared to the benefit to the consumer.	unverifiable
it certainly wouldn't be any more difficult than keeping track of the partial payments in a suspense account.	unverifiable
i work at a federal credit union.	experiential
we currently send out three warning letters  prior to force placing insurance.	experiential
the letters are progressively stern starting with the friendly reminder to finally informing the borrower what the cost will be.	experiential
the letter s have our name and return address on the envelope and do not look like junk mail.	experiential
you would be surprised how many people ignore them until they receive the fourth letter which details the amount added to their loan to cover the cpi.	unverifiable
only then do they call us.	experiential
as a lender i make no money from cpi and, more often than not, have to charge off the cost when the debt goes bad.	experiential
but, the alternative of not having the property insured is too great a risk.	unverifiable
if there is no escrow for insurance the idea of the lender having to pay the primary homeowner insurance is unworkable.	unverifiable
first i will have to determine if they use an agent or directly pay the company.	experiential
then, i will need to review the coverage	experiential
it is unworkable.	unverifiable
we also cannot get the mortgage co. to assist us in any way.	experiential
we were late in the past due to a significant medical event.	experiential
the bank nearly foreclosed, then modified, raising our payment.	experiential
we are now underwater.	unverifiable
and the payment is so large, we can barely pay our other creditors.	experiential
we can't move,	unverifiable
because we can't pay the deficiency balance on the house in our state of md.	experiential
all we are told by the bank is there is nothing available to help us.	experiential
my spouse, who had the medical issue, is working himself to death to meet the obligation.	experiential
its a horrible situation, at 6.25% interest!	unverifiable
the bank knows they have us over a barrel,	unverifiable
and the government has done nothing  to assist.	experiential
the bank has the control-the government is so weak on this, there is no help for underwater mortgages or excessively high payment mods.	unverifiable
you can advise all you want,	unverifiable
but without enforcement, nothing will occur.	unverifiable
my bank is completely nonaccoutable.	unverifiable
they advertise that they are though.	unverifiable
i am not tech savvy, but coupon books have static information and too little information.	unverifiable
i would wish that all lenders were trustworthy;	unverifiable
but they all are not.	unverifiable
prior to my requesting a payment history, i made payments religiously, in good faith, believing that the lender was so.	experiential
now i think differently	unverifiable
because almost $4000 of the payments i made is unaccounted for	experiential
and i do not know how to hold the institution accountable.	unverifiable
they have been giving me the runaround for six months.	experiential
yet, with a coupon book and a trusting consumer, this is possible and probable.	unverifiable
and, as i've said, being able to call and write to the lender or servicer requesting information is guarantee of nothing.	unverifiable
i've been doing that since february - have even had intervention from a local senator - have filed a complaint and dispute with cfpb ,	experiential
and i am still waiting.	unverifiable
at this point, i expect nothing.	unverifiable
i just wanted to alert other coupon book users not to be entirely trusting of their servicers.	unverifiable
i think tasheh has experienced a common problem with coupon books and marcy has not.	unverifiable
let marcy request a coupon book,	unverifiable
but do not give the servicers the first option to provide.	unverifiable
all borrowers should recieve periodic statements, and online access if available.	unverifiable
the fixed rate exception should be stricken.	unverifiable
i think the servicers have been overcharging and sliding in fees for years,	unverifiable
it's quite profitable to take money when the borrower just blindly pays with out question.	unverifiable
perhaps the pushback from the servicers is because it will be lost revenue many consumers never even knew they were paying.	unverifiable
if the servicers are allowed to provide coupon books, they will give them to borrowers who do not want them.	unverifiable
it is easy for them to rip off people who are not able to see the real numbers every month.	unverifiable
so let marcy have her coupon book,	unverifiable
but don't force it on the rest of us,	unverifiable
we want to see real numbers every month.	unverifiable
yes, here's a simple tip, do not borrow from mortgage comanies and banks,	unverifiable
they're crooks,	unverifiable
they lie and give one thing only to give another worse outcome.	unverifiable
they take your money, give poor service and try to throw you out on you butt only to give your house to someone else.	unverifiable
ridiculous, they triple you payments and don't receive the ones you made or hold them in secret.	unverifiable
these guys are full of bs.	unverifiable
don't belive one word they say when they service your loan.	unverifiable
these are rogue scam artist.	unverifiable
you're making a process i know to be simple sound more complicated than it is.	unverifiable
i worked for an insurance tracker, so i'm well aware that the codes are exactly the same to pay a company or agency regardless of the escrow status.	unverifiable
in fact, the escrow status is simply one extra coding step.	unverifiable
you can remove that step.	unverifiable
none of your arguments have any validation.	unverifiable
there's no reason a non-escrow loan can't be treated the same as an escrow loan and that is a 100% verifiable fact that you are only disputing in order to dodge regulation.	unverifiable
nice try, but i'm an expert on loan tracking, and i know better.	unverifiable
i do not seem to be able to reply to moderator's post, so i will start a new comment here.	unverifiable
1. yes, it is often the case that forced insurance is cheaper than regular insurance.	non-experiential
2. it has always been the case that money held in escrow to pay for taxes and insurance was an expense that was prepaid by the borrower.	non-experiential
respa is filled with rules on how to calculate escrow deposits and make sure that the buffer is no more than 2 month's worth of payments.	unverifiable
if a borrower is in default on his loan, there is insufficient funds in his escrow to pay his insurance.	unverifiable
i will always continue paying the taxes because taxes are a priority lien.	unverifiable
but the insurance is nothing but an expense.	unverifiable
if the borrower has reneged on his responsibility to make his monthly mortgage payments and also allows his fire insurance to cancel, then i as the mortgagee should have the right to protect my interest in the collateral property in a reasonable manner, one which will not possibly cause me to lose more money.	unverifiable
1. there are a lot of variables which determine the cost of the ho ins policy.	unverifiable
credit history and property location are probably the two most important.	unverifiable
$100,000 of forced placed insurance would cost, through my provider, $1,545.00.	unverifiable
a ho ins policy through a traditional carrier with dwelling coverage of $200,000.00 could cost, based upon my experiences, between $600 and $2,000.	non-experiential
but i deal with smaller balance loans of 10k to 30k, where the cost of the forced placed policy is almost always less than the ho ins premium.	experiential
so, there is no simple formula that we can use to say that when the mortgage is paid down by x percent, forced insurance will be less expensive than traditional coverage.	unverifiable
2.  although i would happily accept an exception for mortgagees who service their own loans , i think the rule should be based on a solid principal.	unverifiable
as the rule stands now, someone -- either the servicer or the note owner  -- is being required to pay out more money than it has to in order to protect its interest in the property.	unverifiable
just because the servicer is different from the note owner really should not make a difference.	unverifiable
someone is being forced to potentially lose more money than necessary.	unverifiable
in my opinion, if the borrower in default is properly notified that his ho ins policy will no longer be escrowed, and if the borrower in default fails in his responsibility to keep the policy in force, then i believe the mortgagee or the servicer should be free to place a forced policy to protect its interest.	unverifiable
as we have discussed previously, if i pay the customer's premium on his ho ins policy, he can cancel the policy and receive the refund.	non-experiential
asking me to pay the ho ins policy for a borrower in default in monthly installments seems to me to be a tremendous additional burden.	unverifiable
this may sound harsh, but when i make someone a loan, i don't want to become his surrogate mother who has to pay his bills when he can't or won't.	unverifiable
3.  the cfpb's alternative proposal is certainly more appealing than the existing proposed rule.	unverifiable
in my situation, the forced placed policy will most likely cost less than the ho ins policy.	unverifiable
so, i can accept it for sure, but i don't think it is based on a sound principal.	unverifiable
as a drawback to the alternative rule, i do see some litigation issues.	unverifiable
if i choose forced insurance over the defaulted borrower's ho ins policy, and there is a loss, some heavy litigation could result.	unverifiable
"but overall, i absolutely prefer the alternative proposal."""	unverifiable
after submitting a formal complaint through cfpb, the servicer has partially relented.	experiential
"the ""apology"" was veiled and sarcastic, i'm not surprised."	unverifiable
"they agreed to allow online access, but still refuse to provide periodic statements ""to preserve certain debt collection rights""."	experiential
"the case also is not closed as they continue to ""investigate""."	experiential
also the online information is very rudimentary, not detailed enough to show year-to-date details.	unverifiable
the statement area is blocked.	non-experiential
this means the hamp incentive accrual and disbursement is not shown and can not be tracked.	non-experiential
i am partially relieved but this is a glaring example of a servicer who spends time and resources negatively towards the homeowners rather than positively.	unverifiable
i want to see the law changed to stop this kind of abuse, and to alleviate the tens of thousands of others still suffering under this unfair servicer policy.	unverifiable
i just wish i could switch to a nice servicer instead of dealing with this company.	unverifiable
the periodic statement is great and you can see that a lot of thought went into this process.	unverifiable
however , there is 1 very big problem that will have devastating consequences if not fixed.	unverifiable
"under transaction activity"" there needs to be three categories. 1 ""charges""  2 ""payments received""  3 ""payments paid out""."	unverifiable
"this statement still allows banks to generate bogus bills under generic categories like ""property inspection fee""."	unverifiable
general entries like this allow banks to bill homeowners, without even telling the homeowner who they are obligated to pay, knowing the homeowner has no way to verify the bill and even worse senerio was any service ever provided or just a bill.	unverifiable
any time the bank charges your account for something, it should be required to list the company that you are obligated to pay, by company name and contact information.	unverifiable
this way, you can verify with the company that they actually provided the service.	unverifiable
if the vendor is contacted by the borrower, the vendor should have 10 days to provide a service order with the contact information for the person that actually provided the service and a copy of the bill to verify the amount received from the transaction that can be matched up against the statement	unverifiable
nobody should be able to bill you without telling you who it is you owe with out transparency so it can be verified.	unverifiable
with full transparency the borrower can investigate their own loan which would  lower mortgage crime and racketeering.	unverifiable
"property inspection fees under ""transaction activity""  should require 2 entries."	unverifiable
one to enter the actual service into your account and the second to record the actual payment from your account to the vendor.	unverifiable
"if chase is keeping $10.00 of this amount then the paid out for this service needs to be split in the account and any money chase receives in reference to your loan in any given month should be in ""transaction activity"" and explained."	unverifiable
if the entire bill goes to mike's and any amount is cut back to any of the numerous companies set up by the servicer the amount still has to be recorded in the transaction activity.	unverifiable
"your servicer should not be able to keep anything from your account or any split deals from your account without it being recorded in your account directly or indirectly under ""transaction activity""."	unverifiable
any transaction that is not arms length the servicer has to record with details.	unverifiable
the investigators just learned in a hearing that jp morgan is getting up to 75% of the policy when they write a force placed insurance policy.	non-experiential
if the banks were required to record the split deal in your transaction activity statement we would have known this a long time ago	unverifiable
and i think a lot of people would not have lost their homes because of servicer greed.	unverifiable
if jp morgan cuts fannie mae a check from your account then it needs to be in your transaction activity	unverifiable
and if fannie cuts jp morgan a check then it should show up in what ever account it is for.	unverifiable
now people can investigate and know all activity in their account monthly as it is all in transaction activity with real party names and contacts.	unverifiable
let me explain what happened to me with drive by inspections because this is the category used on your sample form.	unverifiable
after my house sold i requested a detailed transaction on what happened with my closing money.	experiential
i learned the banks are out of control,	unverifiable
but sticking to the point, my account was left open for 6 months after the closing	experiential
"and the bank continued to bill my account for ""property inspection assessed"" and ""property inspection paid"" for example."	experiential
the payoff numbers were so over stated	unverifiable
i guess they were trying to justify some of the money.	unverifiable
i then requested information on who did the drive by inspections of my property, through a government agency.	experiential
after many months i received a response from the servicer that said, we do not have to tell you in a nice way.	experiential
i also received a check in the mail without an explanation on it	experiential
and it happens to be the amount for several drive by inspections to the penny.	experiential
so, i asked the servicer what this check was for, already knowing what it was for because of the amount.	experiential
the bank then responded,  we have no record of what you are talking about.	experiential
so, we don't have to tell you was followed with our computer is stupid game sorry!	unverifiable
if i am being billed for drive by inspections  then i have a right to know who did the inspections so i can call and verify the expense being billed to me directly from the source not a bankster.	unverifiable
i should not even have to ask for this information.	unverifiable
the contact information should be mandatory and on the periodic statement.	unverifiable
"your periodic statement sample1 under ""transaction activity"" shows ""property inspection fee"" and is missing the who and when with contact information."	non-experiential
this should not be a generic entry that incubates fraud.	unverifiable
"this same theory should apply to every ""title search company"", every ""legal fee"" ""hazard insurance"" etc.."	unverifiable
"my transaction report has ""lots of ""corporate advance"" entries and should not be allowed."	unverifiable
a lot of entries have no description just money being paid out.	unverifiable
please don't let the entries be what ever	unverifiable
because this is too important to the recovery.	unverifiable
any company that adds a bill to your account should be required to provide you a document that has the amount they received and the person who actually provided the service on the bill where you can read the signature.	unverifiable
the vendor should have a 10 day limit  to provide you a copy of the bill if you contact them directly.	unverifiable
this system works perfect for credit card statements when you put contact information next to the company name and amount due.	unverifiable
transparency will allows borrowers the opportunity to investigate their own loan for accuracy every month for anything that looks suspicious.	unverifiable
realizing that nobody is receptive to a software system like us customs for investigating for some reason makes my second idea  even more important to give the borrower tools to investigate their own loan or this problem is going to get worse.	unverifiable
in order to continue their crimes the banks are dependent on generalities, none disclosure instead of transparency and confusing escrow accounts and no accountability to who or how much they pay out.	unverifiable
transaction activity is currently set up to enable  most frauds to continue based on this one important category.	unverifiable
all of these loop holes need to be closed.	unverifiable
where ever there is generality there will be fraud.	unverifiable
i can only guess that this has not happened or all itemized pay outs, by the bank  would have been addressed with this form.	unverifiable
you have the right category just the wrong wording requirements.	unverifiable
i have had over 8 different contact people with my mortgage company in the past 9 months.	experiential
and these were just the people i dealt with after my application was escalated to the president's office.	experiential
the only answer i would get was that my modification was still in review.	experiential
the last conversation with them was 8 or 31 or 12 when they said it was still under review.	experiential
i just received a letter from my mortgage company stating that my loan was sent to a servicing company and that i would have to deal with them directly with my modification.	experiential
9 months of stall tactics and waiting for a response.	unverifiable
i gave them all the information they needed but they didn't act on it.	experiential
now i will have to begin the whole procedure all over again with another company.	experiential
that is if they don't just foreclose on me.	unverifiable
i think they should be required to send a letter in addition to an email.	unverifiable
phone calls are great but in my experience, the caller does not document accounts thoroughly if at all.	unverifiable
all correspondence regarding past due mortgages should be in writing via email or letter.	unverifiable
it should be dated and time stamped and posted to view by both parties on the customer's account.	unverifiable
everything would be there in black and white.	unverifiable
"the ""periodic statement"" that you have placed up for review could solve almost every issue brought up here if ""transaction activity"" had to be inclusive of any and all account activity, directly or indirectly, addressing companies by name instead of general categories."	unverifiable
the cure is literally that simple.	unverifiable
"the transaction activity"" category is currently set up for generalities that enable bank fraud and deception, which is the problem."	unverifiable
"look at the problems needing addressing here with this question:  ""no obligation to homeowner"", ""run around"", ""accountability"", ""weak rules"", ""lying"", ""deceptive practices"", ""disclosure rights"", ""vague claims"", ""emphasis on servicer accommodation"" etc....."	unverifiable
it is important at this point, to see which other questions you have that could solve all of these problems and start linking your problem questions with your solution questions.	unverifiable
it's not a flow chart but it's a start. :-	unverifiable
if the problem is asking for and getting information then make the information more detailed and available monthly.	unverifiable
this is just common sense.	unverifiable
transparency also allows borrowers to police their own account because our government is lacking funds right now and can't afford an investigator for every account every month.	unverifiable
this is the elephant in the room	unverifiable
the banks have to enter all activity into their computer anyway's, to report to the irs,	unverifiable
this information just need to be entered differently and does not add any work,	unverifiable
it's a slight software issue that needs fixing.	unverifiable
look what a quick books cheep program is capable of, when you add it to your computers.	unverifiable
the banks are running circles around the regulators and law makers.	unverifiable
the banks are acting like they never make changes to there software.	unverifiable
hello, software is constantly changing	unverifiable
and there are too many companies selling bank software to dispute this.	unverifiable
just like car makers need rules on more fuel efficient and safety rules and changes, banks need rules on borrower safety and transparency,	unverifiable
it's just not being done.	unverifiable
"the cfpb is not listening to the ""ordinary"" people because this is the problem now, not the solution."	unverifiable
the banks are probably being asked the same 20 or 30 questions over and over about loans.	unverifiable
please ask versability for a list of the questions, in relation to a loan, that people ask that are currently not covered on the sample monthly statement that could easlily fit on the statement.	unverifiable
varsability that is emailing you, is trying everything to address transparency issues and has the answers you are looking for.	unverifiable
why don't we separate reasonable questions from unreasonable questions.	unverifiable
ask versability, how many of the questions could be answered on the monthly statement and eliminate entire categories of crime and eliminate the need to beg for additional information by the borrower.	unverifiable
versability is an insider,  bank person that understands banking software and what they are capable of doing.	unverifiable
"why is the ultimate goal here, not to reduce as many phone calls as possible, for the borrower to make and the servicer to receive, by providing all monthly activity, in a transparent monthly loan statement,  by maximizing the  ""transaction activity"" category."	unverifiable
everybody is emailing regulation room their information problems.	unverifiable
"it is time to make a list and determine what is ""reasonable"" information and what is not with specific questions or this is useless."	unverifiable
until we do this we are not even addressing the problem.	unverifiable
the government needs to say, this has to be a requirement, due to the uncontrollable level of fraud, money laundering, deception and irresponsibility that the ordinary people are being put through unnecessarily.	unverifiable
the current system is not working and there are no other alternatives that will solve this problem.	unverifiable
"why will our government not step up their game and say, we are not going to allow the banking system any longer, to hide their over priced expenses, behind four interchangeable standard responses that include: ""that is proprietary information"" or ""that is non-recovery"" or we are not going to answer your question in relation to expenses, that your account  was billed etc..."	unverifiable
"we already know what the servicer is going to determine  is ""unreasonable"""	unverifiable
and they will apply the same 4 lousy excuses over and over that i have addressed above,	unverifiable
that happened to me.	experiential
although it was not the largest monetary crime committed in my account, my following example demonstrates the lack of quality response that is the standard servicer response and manipulation of excuses that the current system allows and the proposed generic changes will let continue.	unverifiable
"sadly, this will continue based on the leave it up to the banker to decide if it is an ""unreasonable"" question, as the solution."	unverifiable
i asked who did the drive by inspections of my home, that my account was being billed for,  after my home sold.	experiential
the bank informed me this information was proprietary.	experiential
i received a check for the over billing with no description on the check.	experiential
when i asked jpmc why they mailed me a check dated... for the amount of.... and the check cover page even had a bar code and a check a number.	experiential
"chase responded with: ""chase does not have a record of the letter you are referring to in regards to refund of fees"""	experiential
sorry our computer is stupid game.	unverifiable
"the current system allows banks to be reactive and return only  money on an ""as busted system"""	unverifiable
when a servicer receives a letter questioning something just refund it.	unverifiable
if a borrower is given little information on expenses in their account and you do not get a letter then you keep your ill gotten gains.	unverifiable
it really is a simple system based on limited information.	unverifiable
"with the current system, the servicer just needs to set up a ""got caught expense fund"" and consider it the cost of committing fraud instead of cost of goods sold."	unverifiable
"the government is responsible for this current broken system by not requiring transparent monthly statements with strict guidelines on the use of ""transaction activity""."	unverifiable
versatility as a insider and me having uncovered fraud in almost every categories of my loan payoff statement will both tell you this current disclosure plan does nothing to address the worst problems.	unverifiable
problem:banking fraud and secretive activity involving your loan account that increase your payoff and over states your expenses.	unverifiable
solution: eliminate the secrets with 30 day all inclusive, loan activity statements	unverifiable
and there are no questions or secrets allowed.	unverifiable
the problems are massive and the solutions are so simple.	unverifiable
"so servicers don't have to provide ""confidential""  or ""general corporate"""	unverifiable
this is soooo generic and generally covers anything servicer related	unverifiable
"and my ""that is non-recovery"" would even fit here it is so generic and useless"	unverifiable
"and if the request for information can not be rejected with one of these generic categories jump to ""for information it does not have"""	unverifiable
i could go down this whole list but i think the point is made that this solution is not helpful and is actually counter productive by legitimizing the response that i received above.	unverifiable
i believe that respa should be modified and mandate that the servicer acquiring servicing become responsible for all outstanding payments as of the day of transfer and all payments received by either the selling or purchasing servicer on or after that date.	unverifiable
the selling servicer should be legally prohibited from contacting the borrower on a transferred loan for purposes of collecting a payment after the transfer date.	unverifiable
this prohibition would apply to collecting on nsf checks as well.	unverifiable
the purchasing servicer should be obligated to reimburse the selling servicing for nsfs and perform the function of collecting nsf payments.	unverifiable
if the borrower maintains that a payment was made to the prior servicer it is the responsibility of the purchasing servicer to collect from the selling purchaser.	unverifiable
i am in favor of requiring the selling servicer to return any payment not processed as of the transfer date or received after the transfer date to the borrower.	unverifiable
the transfer letter should spell this out for the borrower.	unverifiable
fines and penalties should be incurred by the selling servicer if the servicer processes a payment on a transferred loan after the transfer date.	unverifiable
borrowers can obviously provide the necessary information as to who cashed their payment check and when.	unverifiable
this can easily be enforced by review or audit of payment and cash deposit records.	unverifiable
any unprocessed payments held at the time of transfer or received after must be forwarded to the purchasing servicer for processing.	unverifiable
purchasing servicers should not be allowed to pass the buck to the prior servicer.	unverifiable
they should be required to make good with the borrower and settle with the selling servicer however they can.	unverifiable
the business risk of not being able to collect from the selling servicer should be taken into account as part of the purchase and sale contract.	unverifiable
the borrower should not be caught up in an argument between seller and buyer.	unverifiable
lol...again, your kidding...since voip systems were implemented, calling across the globe costs nothing!	unverifiable
this is like walking into an emergency room, your practically dying  and your greeted by some computer saying...	unverifiable
come on, lets rebuild communication...talking to each other.	unverifiable
"okay, argument...""when i call, they never pick up""."	unverifiable
well, in addition to voip there are auto dialers same one collection companies use,	non-experiential
even our government uses it for elections.	non-experiential
i am positive everyone has received at least 1 automated call in the past.	unverifiable
add the number to the system and it will call everyday, 10 times a day if you want...until you make a connection.	unverifiable
to the point...phone calls cost as much as sending an email	unverifiable
and if your the mortgagee, you surely have the invested interest in creating a dialog with a distressed client.	unverifiable
anytime a client had a problem, they always had numerous methods of speaking to me	experiential
and when i see issues with thier accounts, forget email, letter, whatever...	experiential
i want to resolve this now,	unverifiable
and as a business, i simply called!	experiential
"8 out of 10, i was able to find the underlying issue the client is having; was able to express my motivation to help them resolve the issue; was able to rebuild the confidence and relationship with that client."""	experiential
magie.passaro i believe if the suggestion i made was in place you would not have had a bad experience when your loan was transferred.	unverifiable
take a look at it and let me know if you think it would have helped.	unverifiable
i had 2 servicers at the same time ,	experiential
and both posted my payment only with different extra fees,	experiential
so totals were not exact,	experiential
and one servicer was not even hired yet,	experiential
this was for 18 months overlapped,	experiential
and i still can't get to the bottom of it.	experiential
i have never gotten answers to my questions,	experiential
and they treat the homeowners like dirt.	unverifiable
the last servicer on record, reported to irs, that the entire principal was paid last year, and zeroed my account balance,	experiential
but the lender still is collecting,	experiential
i have no idea what is going on.	unverifiable
to rely on oral communication would be disastrous for homeowners.	unverifiable
if i had not have everything in writing, i would not have the ability to take them to court.	unverifiable
what many people don't realize is that all customer service representatives  have at least read-only access to all borrower information.	non-experiential
in the case of a system like fis or lps, if a customer calls in asking for a complete history of their loan, it would take a a customer service rep a maximum of 1 minute  for a representative to screenshot the ser_ screen subsets , including sern , the haz_ screen subsets , ori_ , or for_, etc.	unverifiable
for example, if you call in asking for foreclosure information, they can fax or email you a screenshot of the for1 and for3 screens along with a quick breakdown of what information to look for.	non-experiential
your lawyer should be able to call for this same information.	unverifiable
again, every employee has access to this information.	non-experiential
it takes 5 keystrokes to switch between screens if you manually type it or just press a function key  if you're good.	non-experiential
there is no reason this information can't be provided to a borrower within 5 minutes instead of 30-45 business days.	non-experiential
who owns the mortgage is simple...	unverifiable
inv_ is the investor screen subset which shows all historic investors on the loan,	non-experiential
and the current investor is listed on every _ _ _ 1 screen .	non-experiential
if original copies of loan closing documentation is needed, in a worst case scenario, it takes 5 business days to order from iron mountain.	unverifiable
in most cases, it takes 1 minute to retrieve from the loan servicer's loan documentation imaging database.	non-experiential
beautifully said!!!	unverifiable
brilliant!	unverifiable
it took my servicer about 70 days to send a printout with my fees	experiential
not even half the fees were listed.	experiential
"the printout itemized the fees as: $ 625 ""allowable fees"" and $ 750 ""mediation fees"""	experiential
we refused to mediate.	experiential
well if i was the servicer i would do anything to not give out such crappy itemization, too.	unverifiable
it is about time something is done to reign in these servicers.	unverifiable
they are out of control and this is a good start.	unverifiable
the servicers aren't non-profit organizations.	non-experiential
they were hit with an influx of loans tht were defaulting for various reasons from job loss, bankruptcies, medical emeregencies, etc.	non-experiential
but recall that some people used their homes as atm machines and that was another part of the problem.	unverifiable
there is definitely enough blame to go around.	unverifiable
"but going forward,  adding ""expectations"" and regulations doesn't really add up to a solution."	unverifiable
fair and reasonable enforcement needs to be part of the solution.	unverifiable
"a college professor of mine many, many years ago always said think of the word ""kiss"" - keep it simple stupid""."	experiential
in my 30 years of banking and the last 16 as ceo of this small bank, i have never seen a simple regulation.	experiential
even the ones that solve a simple problem have complex rules.	unverifiable
the more complex, the more expensive and the more non-compliance.	unverifiable
i like the suggestions mentioned because we do these things anyway.	unverifiable
it is in our best interest.	unverifiable
i am not sure of the answer,	unverifiable
but i know i will have to comply with all the rules,	unverifiable
i just should not have to pay someone to explain the rules to me.	unverifiable
coupon books should only be for borrowers who request them, at their own peril i might add.	unverifiable
if a small servicer wants to only provide coupon books, then they should at least offer online access as well	unverifiable
so the borrower can track when payments were posted and if any fees are being tacked on.	unverifiable
personally i think coupn books are an outdated tool for the mortgage servicing industry.	unverifiable
i don't know, maybe.	unverifiable
i just think a coupon book is not realistic in the year 2012.	unverifiable
i guess you just need to think about whether a servicer would abuse the rule.	unverifiable
what i can tell you is,	unverifiable
not all servicers are bad,	unverifiable
my last once was very nice to me.	experiential
but some are up to no good, and are unapologetic about it.	unverifiable
so think about the worst case scenario and word your rules carefully.	unverifiable
"i realize the ""effective comments"" should be structured in a clinical fashion,"	unverifiable
but i am not cut from that kind of cloth so please bear with me.	unverifiable
it's quite lengthy but a true story none the less.	unverifiable
after reading those comments you will see that forcing borrowers to immediately pay the new servicer can have unexpected consequences if the new servicer is not cooperating with the borrower.	unverifiable
my old servicer did an excellent job of providing monthly statements as well as online access.	experiential
the new servicer refuses to provide any loan information at all to me, not even what the payment is suppossed to be.	experiential
during this 60 day window i have paid the old servicer twice, once for july and once for august.	experiential
as long as i pay before the first of september, i am still o.k. under the current respa rules.	experiential
i will pay my old servicer one last time since the new servicer will not let me use my online bank bill pay.	experiential
after that i will have to send checks via certified mail to a company that will not give me anything for information in return.	experiential
the value in my story is that despite all the rules and regulations, you can not force a company to act in good faith, unless there is a law requiring them to.	unverifiable
so to mitigate any harm to the borrower, who is at the mercy of the servicer, cfpb should err on the side of the consumer.	unverifiable
think of it a a 60 window of opportunity, one where the borrower has the ability to pay the old servicer until any issues with the new servicer can be worked out.	unverifiable
my issue is not solved.	unverifiable
restricting the consumers ability to pay the old servicer has absolutely no benefit to the consumer,	unverifiable
it only benefits the new servicer.	unverifiable
their is only one simple solution to knowing all your options fast and at one easy to use location available to everybody.	unverifiable
using available computer technology to have someone write a program where you click on your state and answer a series of questions and all government programs are in the program along with all bank programs.	unverifiable
"you hit ""enter"" and it tells you all your options with phone numbers and links to on line forms to fill out to enter the program all in minutes."	unverifiable
there should even be a make an offer section where the bank can offer the home owner money to walk away because it's cost effective or where the home owner can ask to be entered into a short sale program or offer a deed in lieu agreement if they can remain in the home for 6 months for free for example.	unverifiable
or cash for keys offer.	unverifiable
again an option page of all the things the home owner is offering with an expiration time established for response in the form fill in the blank.	unverifiable
one location click for solutions.	unverifiable
again the solution is organized, linked computer programs, that lead you to the solution instantly.	unverifiable
this is preventing investigation of bank records to prevent racketeering and banking colapse, slowing down the economic recovery and eroding consumer confidence just to name a few.	unverifiable
contact the program writers that wrote the amazing linked programs for ancestry.com, ebay and us customs to solve this problem easily.	unverifiable
the problems are massive most solutions are easy.	unverifiable
good computer program writers should be solving all these problems not people that are not computer program writers.	unverifiable
the countries leading computer program writers should be in all important meetings invoving solving our problems	unverifiable
or we will go 4 more years without solutions i am afraid.	unverifiable
they hold the key to solving most of these problems.	unverifiable
asking the public is good	unverifiable
we need a voice and need to help the program writers to address all the issues	unverifiable
and we are important in disecting all the issues and problems.	unverifiable
after disection of the issues it is important to ask the program writers for the easy solution as they already have the solution!	unverifiable
i am a consumer with an usual mortgage where the interest rate is 8.05% for the first 5 years and then adjusts to libor and 2.25% rounded to the nearest .125%.	experiential
the first adjustment date is sep 1 2012.	non-experiential
after the first adjustment date, subsequent adjustments are subject to a 2% interest rate change cap.	non-experiential
the loan servicer, green tree, maintains that the 2% interest rate change cap also applies to the first change date, despite the fact that the mortgage documentation clearly states otherwise.	non-experiential
in other words, green tree states that the new rate will fall to 6.05% on 9 or 1 or 2012, when in fact it should fall to 3%.	non-experiential
i have filed a complaint with the cfpb which has been forwarded to green tree, and we await their reply.	experiential
when calling green tree to discuss the dispute outlined above, their customer service representatives are quite clearly trained to argue with the consumer.	unverifiable
they are not forthcoming with the fact that green tree will only act on disputes when they are submitted in writing, to a fax number that is not published on its web site or its mortgage statements.	unverifiable
"i don't know if green tree is a ""small servicer"","	unverifiable
but clearly their practice is to deflect and obfuscate any attempt by their customers to obtain a response to a concern, and to act by the letter of the law and not its spirit, when profits are in any way at stake.	unverifiable
i applaud these proposed rules and thank you for allowing the public to comment so easily.	unverifiable
"we have been contacted over and over by the customer service person to find out if we plan to ""default""."	experiential
they call so often.	experiential
"we learned from one that we spoke to that they track their ""attempts to assist"" and report it."	experiential
meanwhile, they call and call and just reaffirm that they cann't assist.	experiential
hard to believe they pay someone to be that way with their customers.	unverifiable
1. it is a lloyds of london policy written through swbc.	non-experiential
the cost is $1.50 per $100 of coverage plus 3% tax.	non-experiential
we are absolutely not self-insuring.	experiential
also, there is absolutely no add-on costs.	non-experiential
i charge the customer exactly what swbc charges me.	experiential
2.the renewal cost of the current ho ins policy is $1,340.00.	non-experiential
a very expensive ho ins policy.	unverifiable
i can protect my interest for only $463.50.	experiential
i am the owner of the note.	experiential
it is my money that i am paying out.	experiential
no one is insuring me against a loss.	experiential
the customer has insufficient funds in his escrow account to cover the cost of his ho ins policy, nor the forced fire policy i potentially have to place.	non-experiential
3.  i agree it is better for the customer to have his own insurance.	unverifiable
he has stopped paying my loan, but he absolutely has the option to continue paying on his insurance.	experiential
if he keeps his policy in force, we will accept that.	unverifiable
if he doesn't, and the policy cancels, we will need to write forced insurance.	unverifiable
you seem to have a very strong point of view.	unverifiable
kindly explain to me your rational for why i have to risk more of my own money, paying a very expensive ho ins policy, for a customer who is no longer paying me, when i can protect my interest in the property for 1 or 3 as much.	unverifiable
i'm never sure if anyone reads this stuff or cares.	unverifiable
what the cfpb does will be very important to borrowers and service providers.	unverifiable
i don't agree that size is a necessary condition for excellent service.	unverifiable
we work with financial institutions that service from 10 loans to 10,000	experiential
and the largest give as good and sometimes better service than the smallest.	unverifiable
i believe that most sophisticated financial institutions understand that the total potential relationship a borrower can bring is substantially greater than the value of the servicing strip.	unverifiable
these relationships often develop and evolve over a period of time.	unverifiable
if the financial does not meet the borrower's service level expectations the borrower is more likely to go somewhere else for the other relationships including their next mortgage.	unverifiable
retaining mortgage customers is a critical component of managing the relationship.	unverifiable
depending on the assumptions as to size of loan, frequency of refinancing or purchasing, future economic position of the borrower, etc. we believe the value of the relationship today is worth 4-5x the value of the servicing strip.	unverifiable
earning this value is a very strong motivator that should result in great service.	unverifiable
not everyone believes in the value of the relationship, but i do not think  belief is highly correlated with size.	unverifiable
i am with a company that services mortgage loans.	experiential
we have never sold servicing.	experiential
one reason is simply that the value offered is generally around 20% of the value of the relationship.	unverifiable
another even more important reason is that we believe that you cannot both focus on the value of relationships and sell servicing.	unverifiable
buying and selling are transactions.	unverifiable
relationships are long term investments.	unverifiable
none of the institutions we work with have ever sold servicing.	unverifiable
so one of the measures i would use to determine if an institution should be exempted is,	unverifiable
if it has it cannot qualify for exemption regardless of its size.	unverifiable
in my opinion this is a necessary but not sufficient condition for exemption.	unverifiable
i know of many small institutions that sell servicing.	unverifiable
i have never seen a seller of servicing large or small that had a quality of service provided by a purchaser of the servicing as a requirement for sale.	unverifiable
it has almost always been determined by the amount the purchaser would pay.	unverifiable
there are many companies that will facilitate purchases and sales.	unverifiable
i believe they would agree with me on this point.	unverifiable
i have several other thoughts but this is getting almost too long to read.	unverifiable
i realize that my position my seem a bit extreme.	unverifiable
"as mentioned, coupon books should be for borrowers who request them ""and"" should be a solution for when other payment options are exhausted or unavailable."	unverifiable
it is important to address the needs of all clients with all options.	unverifiable
"though a coupon book is an old method, ""it works"" for those individuals."	unverifiable
if a coupon book is provided, quarterly statements could be implemented to compensate for monthly statements...	unverifiable
quarterly reports are done by almost every company and is a great time to execute.	unverifiable
"i am positive this data  is already ""electronic"" within the company."	non-experiential
this electronic option is not an option or solution,	unverifiable
it is how data is maintained and should or will always be an available method to all accounts regardless of secondary options...	unverifiable
we all know that it is the fastest and the cheapest.	unverifiable
the rules should not be made to favor one option over another,	unverifiable
electronic data must always be available to account holders regardless of how they make thier payments.	unverifiable
