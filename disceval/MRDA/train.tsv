you know over and over.	Defending/Explanation
so they're making	Understanding Check
everything up to that point.	Collaborative Completion
does he want to go there to see it?	Yes-No-question
and so of course it picked up stuff like this.	Statement
but i mean i'm i'm not really sure.	Other Answers
it isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise on on uh some mikes.	Statement
so without and with adaptation.	Statement
uh i think you don't want to have their full name to be uh listed.	Floor Holder
we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise.	Correct-misspeaking
well you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the the seat number.	Offer
i'm thinking prior to that.	Defending/Explanation
subspace i'm i'm like that's still in a little bit in the back burner.	Negative Non-no Answers
so what's to the left of these?	Wh-Question
so yeah it depends.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so far.	Expansions of y/n Answers
these will just be things that are generated.	Statement
and six million for the last one.	Statement
yeah with your backchannels.	Accept
i don't think that we're going to have a lot of undergrads.	Statement
well that's definitely a problem.	Dispreferred Answers
well it it seems like right now if if what they're complaining are those	Rising Tone
i i didn't run it for the whole case.	Statement
i think we're going to have to work on the uh on the human subjects form.	Offer
i mean you could conceivably put an o h or a zero for the o s and still have this benefit.	Statement
and would be great to to to basically take advantage of that to to make a synergy more than an overlap and you know help each other.	Offer
so why don't we do it in that order?	Floor Holder
and there's still uh two people for whom i have not been able to get in touch	Statement
well well we are going to do time alignment.	Floor Grabber
right um and that would be similar to what you're also trying to do.	Accept
and they don't tend to say as much.	Defending/Explanation
and i don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it.	Statement
um so maybe there's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way.	Floor Holder
and then combining them somehow down the line.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and um and didn't say a lot.	Floor Holder
what's l d c?	3rd-party-talk
because we have to label every meeting.	Defending/Explanation
or do you need to do people need to leave?	Downplayer
not in a standard way.	Statement
because even the same person sometimes says o. and sometimes says zero in different context.	Defending/Explanation
and especially you can see if you have like four speakers it be you can maybe find a way of doing that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think you're referring to this bar aren't you?	Statement
where am i?	Self-talk
and apparently it did even better than the original than the original versions.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so this is on the uh before any mel scaling has been done?	Understanding Check
is that you want an intermediate structure which uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling fixing or servicing.	Reformulate/Summarize
oh i like that.	Assessment/Appreciation
and and that's actually a good model which is what this current tool that we're using has is to to associate these labels with um attributes of s g m l tags.	Assessment/Appreciation
and i guess you've mentioned in your progress report or status report that you had written a script to convert it into	Floor Holder
yeah that's pretty close.	Assessment/Appreciation
i think it's sort of a like you guys can take from here.	Defending/Explanation
that's part of the thing we're talking about.	Accept-part
uh the uh torrent chip.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
stuff is not very technical.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but more of you know if if there is some part of your system that has to buffer twenty frames uh can't the other parts of the system draw out of that buffer and therefore not add to the latency?	Rising Tone
yeah basically from the command line.	Statement
you're right this is going to require more thought.	Accept
like i'll go	Statement
same idea?	Collaborative Completion
yeah i think it's okay.	Floor Grabber
i i shouldn't be allowed to by by my own by my according to my own priorities.	Dispreferred Answers
can you do it for them?	Humorous Material
now there the human subjects committee is very precise.	Statement
it is a unification base.	Dispreferred Answers
so as part of this um project we need to transcribe these meetings.	Action-directive
that uh i mean you know one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra?	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so in terms of the uh planner what's what's a good one to do?	Wh-Question
i think that'd be really interesting too with blindfolds.	Offer
were they putting down where they lived at the moment they recordings were made?	Rising Tone
actually for a lot of these people i think you could just sort of backchannel continuously.	Humorous Material
you should also have a record of what's on the board.	Offer
not eliminated entirely.	Defending/Explanation
of a big pause in between in the middle of a word.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh what do you do over five hundred?	Floor Holder
and scale those.	Statement
oh i'd be delighted with that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and in that uh regard i thought we definitely will need it'd it'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains or a few different kinds of meetings.	Offer
i can't answer that.	Other Answers
oh you would keep uh.	Acknowledge-answer
because it's just	Defending/Explanation
oh yeah	Accept
i mean if channel one v.a.d. gives you	Statement
what are what are some of the low level detectors that they use?	Rising Tone
it's like well uh a main server or you can do a c v s server.	Rising Tone
um you know there's this block and it goes over	Floor Holder
i always thought that was or sort of with a strange pronunciation.	Defending/Explanation
the residual error?	Understanding Check
where you take you know something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah i guess i'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff.	Commit
and i think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on personally.	Statement
there are that use bad online normalization.	Statement
i don't i don't know absolutely nothing.	Other Answers
but it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields.	Statement
i bet it it might have may have been.	Maybe
doesn't have a huge effect but it but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places.	Statement
they won't	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and again we'll have to do layout at some point.	Commit
well yeah these numbers i mean.	Floor Grabber
since we don't have enough data yet.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from?	Wh-Question
because doesn't work uh when you uh you try to to to to do an a dated access to to a file a big file uh uh moving the the head of the in the hard disk uh forward and backward a lot of time	Statement
and if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers then when when it got patched together when it comes back from i b m we can add the backchannels.	Offer
well i mean one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot.	Statement
yeah i was just going to ask the same thing.	Accept
and just listen to them.	Understanding Check
when you train on macrophone it seems better on meeting digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line.	Accept
that's very strange.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean i can tell you i just don't know off the top of my head.	Other Answers
my	Signal-non-understanding
which is a zero twenty.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food.	Action-directive
well we when we when we discussed it it was it was where where you lived during your childhood and adolescence.	Statement
i i i'm i was sort of serious.	Downplayer
or should we give it to them and let them do with it what they can?	Or-Clause
i mean you want you want it for every place that's voiced.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
right so you could do something like uh	Floor Grabber
this is fine with me.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i'm i'm sorry i'm interrupting that.	Apology
yeah like like the same meeting shortened files that we pull off of popcorn when we're done doing the recording looked to the backup software as if they had been written you know every single night for you know a week in a row.	Floor Grabber
and then you got the the different channels come out.	Statement
when the speech when the signal level is more important compared to this noise level the coefficient is small and around one.	Rising Tone
so so i i think that probably as good an introduction as you'll get.	Rising Tone
and he says wiener filter is is forty milliseconds delay.	Statement
yeah good idea.	Accept
okay so we were on the data collection and the summary issue.	Floor Grabber
so what's what's happened?	Rising Tone
because it means that somebody's about to interject something.	Defending/Explanation
system	Rising Tone
well i figured that.	Rising Tone
how would you imagine doing a test set on this corpus?	Wh-Question
and the properties are filled in uh from ontology items.	Statement
but i think having the the idea of the computer sort of in there forces you to create a a log file format that can handle these other devices.	Offer
we should do that.	Offer
correlation yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
maybe for that.	Statement
based on the	Yes-No-question
you have a question?	Declarative-Question
l p c?	Signal-non-understanding
too much caffeine.	Humorous Material
and they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them.	Statement
is better?	Understanding Check
that's not a bad idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
that's actually being that's one of the problems that's being addressed at this year's evaluation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that you did have nice interpolative effects.	Statement
or window it.	Offer
i mean someone's going to have to pass through either a higher level person will have to pass through or you have to be sure you get good quality to begin with.	Defending/Explanation
i mean it it'd be really great if it was all automatic but i think that you know given the pressure of time if	Floor Grabber
i mean so this is like the noise compensation is fixed.	Statement
oh no i'm so sorry.	Apology
and he worked on non stationary noises.	Statement
given that for example the data says you know a v a e or something.	Statement
so i have a question about queries.	About-task
you you do need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform.	Statement
which is more like you know close to in meetings like these uh you know close to twenty percent.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like the beginning of an utterance.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um i'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff.	Other Answers
yourself?	Declarative-Question
is that um basically the way online normalization was done uh is just using this recursion on on the um um on the feature stream.	Rising Tone
did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with liberman?	Yes-No-question
being totally monolingual i'm not the right person to ask to talk about this.	Downplayer
but now i'm i'm just used to it.	Downplayer
will we have	Rising Tone
okay wonderful.	Acknowledge-answer
actually i use something like this on on the telephone and it's very comfortable.	Statement
yeah it might be.	Accept
was it in the uh recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all?	Rising Tone
so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines uh to use as sort of a compute farm.	Statement
so in fact it's a little hard because recognizers to first order sort of work.	Floor Holder
uh one one last question on that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and so in principle you if you remove that source then you know you can	Statement
so that you can adjust it to sort of any any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing.	Statement
well then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time.	Floor Grabber
what are we talking about today?	Wh-Question
uh i i don't know.	Other Answers
there's the v a d issue.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so the next thing maybe i what i will try to to do is just to try to smooth huh the um to smooth the the result of the subtraction.	Commit
right i mean	Acknowledge-answer
because you know the time it takes is you listen to it and then you press the return key.	Defending/Explanation
however people also sometimes say how do i get there.	Statement
yeah the you know the reason that he uh just used silence was not because he thought it was better it was it was it was the place he was starting.	Floor Grabber
i guess it depends partly on the type of interruption.	Statement
to the language model model.	Statement
the boxes are cheap.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh i started multi band m l p trainings.	Rising Tone
wi	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i just drag the line.	Mimic Other
or is it that we get for each each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub e sub d sub u and maybe a sub o o for ontology um meta node?	Or-Clause
yeah this could be	Acknowledge-answer
and then jose responds.	Statement
they didn't have to collect it.	Rising Tone
oh the one is this one is just the baseline plus the uh wiener filter plugged into it.	Acknowledge-answer
i just have no preference.	Statement
and then especially if you've got a pause following it.	Statement
and the new online normalization neither.	Statement
and that's the result basically that o g i has also with the m f c c with online normalization.	Rising Tone
with nothing.	Collaborative Completion
you know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what is the plan?	About-task
i i agree that it's an issue here but it's also an issue for switchboard.	Statement
not being morgan though it's	Defending/Explanation
and have you looked	Yes-No-question
i've been playing with this wiener filter like.	Topic Change
yeah yeah we have to sort of figure out what we're going to do.	Accept
what about that error that that uh the the supposed	Wh-Question
weren't we going to take a picture at the beginning of each of these meetings?	Rising Tone
because that was the that was the reason why i was not getting a lot of improvement for estimating the noise.	Defending/Explanation
it's a bunch of like four people discussing.	Defending/Explanation
you could see the contribution of the air conditioning.	Defending/Explanation
did you do similarly in performance between them and the other meetings?	Rising Tone
or the right the right range.	Misspeak Self-Correction
so again i think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh in in in in	Floor Holder
is is yours working there chuck?	Rising Tone
oh thank you!	Exclamation
um and i don't know if that i mean since you're dealing with issues of robustness you know maybe maybe this isn't right but it'd be something i'd be concerned about.	Floor Holder
and they look fine to me.	Assessment/Appreciation
you always want to have a little bit of pause or nonspeech around the speech say for recognition purposes.	Defending/Explanation
so it could be that it's not actually wired backwards.	Defending/Explanation
you know cross talk cancellation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
does building queries based on what's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what morgan wants to do later?	Yes-No-question
and i don't worry about layout.	Action-directive
because you you don't have a true estimate of the noise.	Defending/Explanation
yes yeah i mean it can't be compared with the other.	Floor Grabber
let's say ten.	Action-directive
so if you don't have to adjust the bins why not just do what it for all the channels?	Offer
we're we're we're getting enough data now that i'd sort of like to do it now before i get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it.	Offer
but but regardless it's going to it's hard to compare cross corpus.	Statement
and given given that we've got a wireless that we've got a we got the field.	Statement
do we explicitly downsample?	Misspeak Self-Correction
uh does it have a speaker?	Rising Tone
it's just sort of that the the background acoustic.	Defending/Explanation
uh i think to know what it's to have a better feeling for what it's doing you want to look at it.	Offer
we we will try m s g.	Rising Tone
so uh since uh we didn't get a channel on for you you don't have to read any digits.	Floor Holder
and maybe maybe they	Statement
still institutionally second?	Declarative-Question
that that's the six tables that we're looking at.	Statement
well you're not doing the l p c	Dispreferred Answers
but you could always post hoc label them.	Offer
so you you cache the utterances?	Understanding Check
like by the time he graduates.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but i guess it's still within their rules to have have it on the uh uh server side.	Understanding Check
nothing else?	Declarative-Question
but but my main goal was um in these areas where you have a three way overlap and one of the overlaps involves yeah and it's swimming in this huge bin i wanted to get it so that it was more closely localized.	Statement
with respect to the features.	Statement
yeah actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny.	Rising Tone
but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything.	Expansions of y/n Answers
somewhat although what's interesting is that the majority of the words in the language model are actually	Accept-part
oh that's better.	Statement
um but um uh	Floor Holder
all today huh?	Understanding Check
yes in this case	Floor Grabber
because it's hard to sit there and see like but don't you see you're being rude to this person you're cutting off this person.	Defending/Explanation
well the other thing too is i mean if if you have the equipment then it could be different.	Statement
so try to pick things that other people didn't say.	Expansions of y/n Answers
this one being different.	Downplayer
oder there was an talk?	Rising Tone
and then there's a third thing.	Rising Tone
yeah the the reason why we did it that way as a as a reminder is uh no person is going to do all of them.	Floor Grabber
you know these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the out of construction in the b c p paper where it's just like you know half a page on each one or something.	Understanding Check
i'm doing it from my perspective.	Defending/Explanation
uh i think they will send um files.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries.	Statement
well i i've been i've been training a new v a d and a new feature net.	Rising Tone
do a listing of them.	Statement
yeah to me it's like a vocal shrug.	Assessment/Appreciation
what's the problem the i forget.	Statement
shrink in them or whatever.	Collaborative Completion
i noticed that in the pictures.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i i want to think about it.	Statement
all right everybody's laughing.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah i'm sure it's	Acknowledge-answer
yeah so twenty percent error rate on digits.	Floor Grabber
even if we don't make any decisions we'll have a lot of data.	Defending/Explanation
i'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it it it it might be semi random.	Statement
so the other topic with digits is uh	About-task
yeah we filter all that out.	Floor Grabber
technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes.	Expansions of y/n Answers
are you going to have the audio on the web site?	Rising Tone
yeah eighty or ninety for the shures.	Accept
because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate.	Defending/Explanation
what what model?	Signal-non-understanding
because we don't didn't looked that much at that.	Defending/Explanation
uh it wasn't a pure task the first time.	Defending/Explanation
uh i'm waiting there was one problem with part of it.	Statement
well maybe it's because they don't realize that you're supposed to	Statement
well it's useless for this function.	Accept-part
we could change a smaller disk for a larger one.	Offer
did did that help at all?	Rising Tone
then they will just fill fill it up.	Statement
but let's let's consider what that means.	Rising Tone
i think you got to have somebody who knows the knows the topic or you know whose job it is delegated to be the note taker.	Defending/Explanation
well that i think someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact.	Offer
uh yeah yeah yeah yeah.	Accept
but it's um	Statement
uh there's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but in any case i didn't mark those.	Statement
i don't remember	Other Answers
i and when i tell people what i do here	Statement
did anybody else here do that?	Rising Tone
you know they have channel adaptation.	Expansions of y/n Answers

she's already done quite a bit.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah when hell yep we'll do it when hell freezes over.	Accept
and subtract it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because we can't do too much you know on in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem.	Defending/Explanation
you know in writing you have this two spaces and a big gap.	Statement
so people sitting here are going testing one two three.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which you know it's a device which will record onto tape uh multiple channels.	Defending/Explanation
that'd be excellent.	Assessment/Appreciation
is this t.i. digits?	Rising Tone
and then separate the next.	Offer
so the let's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing.	Action-directive
but sorry.	Apology
we could just do it through these.	Statement
and then this sound must be this sound.	Statement
so at any rate jane was looking into the possibility of getting students.	Floor Grabber
it's still it's interesting for other reasons.	Defending/Explanation
is if if you have a good voice activity detector isn't isn't it going to pull that out?	Rising Tone
is it the french one?	Rising Tone
but if you put optional won't they just leave it blank rather than lie?	Rising Tone

which i've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of uh twenty five experiments.	Expansions of y/n Answers

but what we should be able to do	Statement
because you know i i'm privy to information which really by all rights i shouldn't be.	Defending/Explanation
but the guenter's argument is like if it is a non stationary segment then he doesn't update the noise spectrum.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i guess you first you have to do the first one.	Floor Grabber
it's just disturbing.	Assessment/Appreciation
whereas thilo's won't have that.	Statement
which would be my guess.	Statement
i mean do you think that um that uh maybe	Yes-No-question
oh does	Acknowledge-answer
but what what was your result for uh that we had at the h l t?	Wh-Question
which one do you use jim?	Wh-Question
like so these things are like having a better v.a.d.	Statement
this is the same same company that may be doing the transcripts for us.	Statement
um and also we're we're using a couple of the labelers who are doing emotion to help us um finalize some transcripts for this.	Floor Holder
cubic root of power spectrum.	Mimic Other
there's just more variety.	Defending/Explanation
but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes.	Statement
it's going to be very hard to be comparable.	Defending/Explanation
well after that.	Self-talk

um and if other people are laughing then i'll usually give them and say that they're laughing.	Floor Holder
uh dave gelbart sent me email i think he sent it to you too that um there's a special topic section in in eurospeech on new corpora.	Floor Grabber
well don't you	Rising Tone
it wasn't there?	Tag-Question
that's what spectral subtraction will help with practically speaking.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah but one one dimension.	Accept-part

you understand what i'm	Declarative-Question
spatial organization.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but after we've done thilo's thing.	Understanding Check
it's spread out.	Statement
so you could get those going while dave is um creating waveforms for the re training the short male models.	Offer
but it's really good.	Assessment/Appreciation
like you know morgan will be on jane's channel.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so is it just one cluster per	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think we can discuss everything.	About-task
spectral subtraction i guess.	Maybe
i think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session.	Offer
another thing i like about it is that you this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule.	Statement
but so the syllables were in the same order with respect to each other but the	Understanding Check
but but but so	Floor Grabber
awesome.	Assessment/Appreciation
they used mumble for	Understanding Check
huh well we can do the frame dropping on the server side.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
this is this is a new experience.	Statement
no you get it with wiener filtering also.	Reject
it it's wiener filtering.	Dispreferred Answers
i had another thought just now.	Statement
possibly it's been like four months.	Maybe
that's partly a nonnative-native thing.	Statement
and um um anticipating the end of a question and simply answering it earlier.	Floor Holder
and so they just write it as a breath when it's clearly not a breath.	Rising Tone
when hynek's had people do this kind of l.d.a. analysis they've done it on frequency direction.	Statement
i mean that was the main visual thing that i noticed.	Statement
and overlap or not.	Collaborative Completion
no no we definitely would not have the user fill it out.	Reject
yeah i figured that they didn't.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but i think uh that's that's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams.	Statement
or or if it's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
web site's what?	Declarative-Question

were we going to do digits?	Rising Tone
we don't need x. access.	Dispreferred Answers

i think partly because i want to make sure that people know that my my thought my utterance is finished.	Defending/Explanation

we're not trying to generate good examples.	Defending/Explanation
huge amounts.	Expansions of y/n Answers

you probably wouldn't ordinarily.	Repeat
depending on if we put if we square the transfer function or not.	Expansions of y/n Answers

actually just to be some more	Floor Grabber
so you take sixty four millisecond f.f.t.'s and then you average them over five hundred?	Understanding Check
that's true that's very true.	Accept
i mean it's not to say i mean i certainly think it's extremely and we we humans depend on you know these these binaural cues.	Statement

what i i want to ask you at some point it just occurred to me i'd like to ask you the following question maybe you can have this in the back of your minds something like um you know what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things.

yes okay.	Acknowledge-answer
and you know maybe something else is important later.	Expansions of y/n Answers

but we still have to implement a routine that does recursive filtering.	Rising Tone
we actually have yeah quite similar hardware as it turns out.	Dispreferred Answers

there's all these cues.	Statement

actually that comes back to a point.	Statement
you want to go ahead morgan?	Rising Tone

but you know those that's really very obvious.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's really enormously far away.	Assessment/Appreciation
no uh that that wasn't recorded.	Reject

it's single pronunciation.	Acknowledge-answer

uh well there are other things that we should do.	Floor Holder
it's like you're behind closed doors.	Statement
right huh.	Acknowledge-answer
it's uh but with the exception of the stops i guess it's pretty much the same as voiced unvoiced.	Understanding Check
yeah i was going to ask that too.	Acknowledge-answer
and then just uh i guess uh progress reports individually and then uh plans for where we go between now and then pretty much.	About-task
because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other's utterances.	Defending/Explanation
now we get to the comments.	About-task
maybe you and i can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page.	Offer

you wonder if there'd be like a gender difference there?	Understanding Check
that's neat.	Assessment/Appreciation

i have one concept i i want to say which is that i think it's nice that you're preserving the time relations.	Assessment/Appreciation
yes yes yes yes.	Acknowledge-answer
so you don't have to pay as much attention.	Defending/Explanation
which both had roughly the same.	Expansions of y/n Answers

what does he do to choose those?	Wh-Question
they're all downsampled.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

does have to be there.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

we don't we don't know actually.	Other Answers
how do they affect it?	Or-Question
no kidding?	Rhetorical-question Continue

i know this sounds weird.	Downplayer
just extract them all.	Offer
you know a single form that's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers

when i look at the spectrogram there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech.	Statement
i'll i'll talk to michael.	Commit
yeah in grenada.	Acknowledge-answer
because we're running late.	Defending/Explanation
if you did a high pass filtering as hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation uh uh avendano and hermansky were arguing that uh perhaps one of the reasons for that working was may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all positive power spectrum you get some negative values.

and they wouldn't know about each other.	Defending/Explanation
so a printout of the communication between those two fills up.	Floor Holder
uh as opposed to what you'd really want to know if you were going to use this thing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because it's it's the f.t.t. bins.	Defending/Explanation
well maybe for the native english speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it's that unreliable.	Offer
uh this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you're not going to make a mistake.	Statement
so um uh	Floor Holder

it is good.	Accept

you have multiple channels.	Defending/Explanation
why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them and then and then and then and then and then we	Action-directive

it's actually unclear right now.	Other Answers
are you going to use which of the two techniques?	Rising Tone
and there there's a lot of speaker dependence there.	Assessment/Appreciation
or at least that's what i found.	Defending/Explanation

if it makes mistakes it'll be different though.	Reject-part

two gig.	Rising Tone
i mean if their auditory capabilities uh have been you know um squished down like in a certain place where it would be easier for a person with normal um hearing to hear a male's voice	Rising Tone
because i mean you're both working on it and with you know different sampling rates and these silly things like that.	Defending/Explanation

what what sort of normalization do you do?	Rising Tone

oh they don't even have to detect voiced speech.	Rising Tone
so i didn't did you get a chance to look at all yet?	Rising Tone
the main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies.	Statement
because the l.d.c. has been advising them on this process.	Defending/Explanation
uh and um	Floor Holder
um so since last week we've started to fill the column with um uh features with nets trained on p l p with online normalization.	Floor Holder
cheap to transcribe.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no no let's not.	Reject
but i just would add the the the second row one.	Offer
but if they feel like they're getting something out of it sometimes you can do it that way.	Offer
uh uh doctor susan ervin tripp.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement

except i don't think that the the instructions for doing that was in that directory.	Defending/Explanation
how how much latency does the uh does our v a d add?	Wh-Question
i'm not sure if it's that's much.	Other Answers
the other thing actually that gets at this a little bit of something else i'd like to do is what happens if you have two p d a's?	Wh-Question
you don't know it	Acknowledge-answer
because i've been told i mumble.	Defending/Explanation
either well either spectrum or cepstrum.	Statement
the close talking microphone.	Misspeak Self-Correction
um and then also anonymity how we want to anonymize the data.	Floor Holder
i'd fix that too.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
oh no sorry.	Apology
so what does that mean?	Floor Grabber
so that's why it really seems like the constraint in in all this stuff it's the constraints that are actually what matters.	Statement
and there will be additional situational information.	Statement
and so now i'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute.	Statement
so it's not so important.	Statement
if you're talking about the macrophone results that andreas had about um a week and a half ago i think it's the same system.	Defending/Explanation
um it's to to integrate and syntactic analysis.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
yeah less	Accept
and you want to use either x.a. or scratch.	Statement

and if it's an independent	Statement
well the other way i was thinking about it was assigning them an i d.	Offer
because i named that already something.	Defending/Explanation
kind of graspy.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's typical huh.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then go through i mean and go through and and try and re transcribe it given that we had perfect boundary detection.	Offer
totally.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well so perhaps let's let's jump at the last experiment.	About-task
because there's filters have all sorts of temporal and spectral behaviors.	Defending/Explanation
oh oh oh yeah okay.	Acknowledge-answer
so we're going to actually train a recognizer based on these uh far field mikes.	Understanding Check

uh and also i i have this sort of east coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the west coast to understand what i'm saying.	Floor Holder
oh i went crazy.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory.	Offer
what you're what you're going to	Statement
so another way of doing it maybe would be just to take the f.f.t. uh power spectrum and feed it into a neural network.	Offer
well we did it in unison last time.	Statement
because i'm still wondering where this improvement comes from.	Defending/Explanation
uh and if you've got enough time uh this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable.	Offer
we could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files.	Offer
and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um there is the format of the table which is quite impressive.	Floor Holder
oh conference call.	Acknowledge-answer
we can.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um and apparently they get reasonable results.	Statement
oh so there's something you can download to just learn?	Understanding Check
so if we	Statement
this is the french software right?	Statement
with the fan.	Collaborative Completion
improves the baseline?	Understanding Check
uh and uh yeah you may not have word models you have phone models whatever.	Floor Holder
that's error rate or recognition rate?	Understanding Check
um what is what does combo mean?	Floor Holder
so one question.	Floor Grabber
could uh uh	Yes-No-question
however seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes.	Reformulate/Summarize
but i didn't have any i didn't even have a	Statement
and you can get time student time to clean up the corpus and things.	Offer
oh but that's a	Floor Grabber
so so you know that that that the way that they're	Floor Grabber
uh my current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it.	Floor Holder
which is nice and flexible.	Assessment/Appreciation
i just wanted to be sure.	Defending/Explanation
so this thing this uh deliverable d three point one of the mate project is a review of a lot of different tools.	Understanding Check
you know i mean it's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment.	Statement
and this this was fifty two point six.	Statement
it could do a nonlinear spectral subtraction.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
preparing for quals.	Statement
is the question.	Collaborative Completion

recording it's easy.	Statement
how much of heidelberg can you get around by public transport?	Wh-Question

is that how you pronounce her name?	Yes-No-question
it's another one?	Understanding Check
because when you listen to a sentence you can tell if it's contrastive stress.	Defending/Explanation
i would have thought so.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah let's get rid of them.	Accept
but i guess maybe the thing since you weren't you guys weren't at that that meeting might be just just to um sort of recap uh the the conclusions of the meeting.	Action-directive
and so if the if if the issue	Statement
that is marked as speech.	Collaborative Completion
i much prefer these.	Assessment/Appreciation
so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things.	Offer
so that when they did experiments they could compare.	Defending/Explanation
right right exactly.	Accept
it ought to be called a a dialogue manager.	Statement
and no no with	Reject
this was user something?	Understanding Check
what's nice about getting this corpus is with the people wired you have a excellent baseline.	Assessment/Appreciation
or you estimate fine harmonic structure.	Statement
so i think though it's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that i haven't yet done yet in the same meeting could use it on the next segment of the text.	Offer
but if we had the crosspads we could ask people you know if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow.	Defending/Explanation
and if we're re doing the baseline anyways it it it would be okay.	Understanding Check
so this this happens in the very first one.	Statement
period right.	Collaborative Completion
where is x?	Offer
and so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms that's the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do.	Reformulate/Summarize
now the other thing i wonder about actually is what if you left it negative?	Wh-Question
if people are interested in in getting jobs running on that maybe i could help with that.	Offer
because you went through and you concatenated all of these things together	Rising Tone
i was commenting about this.	Statement
i i there are huge differences you know in the others.	Defending/Explanation
now let let me just give you the other side to that.	Floor Grabber
when you're talking to the computer knowing when you're done speaking.	Defending/Explanation
so it's it's a small you know atis-sized type task.	Defending/Explanation
i mean i think that you know if a person who	Statement
right i mean adam was	Accept
right but that example was not	Acknowledge-answer
most certainly so it's just uh if we're going to do that we should give some thought to how we want to divide it up.	Accept
uh because it	Defending/Explanation
because that's very different than any kind of data that we have so far.	Defending/Explanation
so are do you feel comfortable just picking one?	Floor Holder
well i mean that's the other option is that we could switch the form so it's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike.	Offer
the best seat or or right.	Collaborative Completion
none of that.	Action-directive
um and then you have this multiplicity of voices uh reading these things.	Floor Holder
so it's a very nice thing.	Assessment/Appreciation
why'd they develop it?	Rising Tone
little bit of treats.	Statement
i mean a lot of corpora	Defending/Explanation
that'd be a problem.	Acknowledge-answer
or do you have a very clear idea of what you're going to do?	Or-Clause
and then adding the m s g does nothing basically.	Understanding Check
so it is sort of far field stuff.	Statement
i think that starts to there's definitely some clear cases.	Statement
the only tags that you need to add is	Expansions of y/n Answers
how long will it be?	Reformulate/Summarize
but what were they?	Wh-Question
um one thing i i wanted to or you can tell a good joke and then everybody's laughing and you get a chance to break in.	Floor Grabber
so we took out that part of the road network as a hack.	Rising Tone

well i mean what you'd rather do is nothing at all.	Floor Grabber
greedy.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and um in in a way by by having this this chunk and then the backchannel after it it's like a staggered mixed channel.	Floor Holder
i mean mari and	Statement
it's not it's not just a question of how much information is there as if you will always take maximum advantage of any information that's presented to you.	Statement
i mean that seems like that'd be weird.	Assessment/Appreciation

well go go on.	Action-directive
whereas if they listen to it and there's don't hear any speech i think they'd probably just listen to it once.	Defending/Explanation
and then uh as jane said the last question is list other language influences bilingual dialects et cetera.	Statement
i mean it seems like if you have just two people it's not really like a meeting is not as similar as the rest of the of the sample.	Negative Non-no Answers

so i i guess	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i mean there's we're we're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost.	Statement
let's go to our favorite endpoint one.	Self-talk
whether you know there're dialogue action planners that work with belief nets that are action planners that work with you know state automata.	Statement

it's hard to what you it's hard to tell on a neural net is what's going on internally.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

yeah it might it might partly just be european summer vacation issues.	Floor Grabber
that solves everything.	Defending/Explanation
because uh it'll it'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from sony anyway.	Defending/Explanation
i mean what you want to do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition.	Offer
we're going to start with just three people.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
no i work with uh italian and spanish basically.	Reject
so then we probably don't need the fine grained information.	Understanding Check
well could you take what was left over and then subtract that?	Yes-No-question
you don't hear the full the full band of frequencies.	Defending/Explanation
yeah but also there's an online besides the a g c there's an online normalization that's supposed to be.	Floor Grabber
so we'll probably do another one at the end of the meeting.	About-task
on yourself.	Expansions of y/n Answers
then there would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query.	Statement
i mean we've been been been lax and lucky.	Defending/Explanation
amaretto?	Understanding Check
tea!	Acknowledge-answer
and this will give you the flavor of the of what.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you'll at least be able to see whether difficulty across site is due to you know the lexicon version.	Defending/Explanation
i don't know if any of this is going to come in in time to be relevant.	Downplayer
that would've taken more time.	Defending/Explanation
because you end up	Defending/Explanation
unusual.	Dispreferred Answers
it seems like everything in a user model affects	Assessment/Appreciation
existence proof you know.	Collaborative Completion
well it's that's not a problem though.	Dispreferred Answers
the word seven.	Understanding Check
do you have any favorite parts of these meetings?	Rising Tone
but not quite the same.	Defending/Explanation
ask them if they have an extra one.	Offer
because right now their script only handles processing on a single c.p.u.	Defending/Explanation
i'm not worrying about it.	Statement
okay so so it's called transcriber you said?	Understanding Check
and uh you know minute zero of course is the first minute up to sixty seconds.	Statement
and another in uh lucent that i met at i. cassp.	Statement
you know where you could get it?	Declarative-Question
but i'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the wave lan thing they're using.	Defending/Explanation
because the transcriber's put in intonational tags?	Understanding Check
i mean we're not doing exactly that.	Defending/Explanation
and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the s.f.	Statement
so maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms.	Offer
i have i have one question.	Negative Non-no Answers
uh when you compare it with the v.a.d. based which v.a.	Wh-Question
switchboard for instance.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean they can just limit the number of people.	Offer
oh there's hold on.	Self-talk
so it was it was a bad example in that way.	Assessment/Appreciation
one thing that the um l.p.c. approach will hopefully give me in addition um is that i i might be able to find the the bandwidths of these humps as well.	Statement
we could easily there's just a couple other meetings that	Offer
yeah we also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things.	Accept
um if you model the the effect that me speaking has on your microphone and everybody else's microphone as well as on that and you build um	Floor Holder
but but it's it's just it's it's just a little more complicated.	Downplayer
well it's just because it's my turn.	Downplayer
besides with this big a group.	Defending/Explanation
the well matched has mismatch?	Understanding Check
i i don't get any mail about	Statement
well but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question.	Negative Non-no Answers
but you got some sort of different result.	Negative Non-no Answers
whose result?	Wh-Question
but there can be more	Statement
in which case we'll have to get them some other way.	Statement
yeah yeah yeah whatever this is.	Acknowledge-answer
but training it on more data.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh so that would be interesting as well to do that.	Assessment/Appreciation
and it's a little confusing.	Defending/Explanation
yeah so for for me there's there's a there are people	Floor Grabber
then do some more spectral subtraction!	Exclamation
and they put a threshold like six or ten d b above.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it'll it'll be on the on the unix side.	Understanding Check
but you end up reducing some neighboring frequency bins in the average right?	Understanding Check
and each feature stream has its own m.p.l.	Rising Tone
because i thought i thought you were using the whole macrophone set.	Defending/Explanation
yochai's company is like that.	3rd-party-talk
so uh that's another another possibility for this this kind of work.	Statement
you could imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you added in was uh a function of the probability of it being speech or noise.	Statement
and then i haven't done any of the aurora stuff.	Statement
yeah much more	Floor Grabber
stereo.	Collaborative Completion
so it would be for the first deadline.	Statement
and what that'll do is just cut the time a little further.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i mean i guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh the s.r.i. recognizer.	Statement
but i think it it it certainly is another type of meeting that could be done.	Statement
uh well we start from ninety four point sixty four.	Rising Tone
i i missed that.	Defending/Explanation
or in quebec.	Understanding Check
bet they'll have fun with that one.	Statement
so that it's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root.	Defending/Explanation
you know every five words there'd be something i'd put in parentheses because i didn't know what it was.	Statement
yeah so at any rate you're looking general uh standing back from it looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh noise removal uh with with these other things we have.	Floor Grabber
understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said okay.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well that that that's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things things like harmonicity and residual energy are uh yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they'll be more reliable.	Floor Grabber
i mean so this is going to be a lot worse.	Statement
you want to change them one at a time.	Statement
are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints?	Rising Tone
and everybody had finished.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or is there another	Or-Clause
so if you could just fill out the form.	Floor Holder
it's going next door.	Expansions of y/n Answers
how big is the small training set?	Wh-Question
wow wow.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's going to require some coordination.	Statement
i mean i i think it was um four	Statement
and adam and thilo have a program they put it back together into our interface format.	Statement
uh it's not guaranteed.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
using uh recursive filters actually.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but that doesn't	Statement
n.	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah i've taken out some of those.	Floor Grabber
something something like um um like uh regular phonetic features.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um hopefully nancy will come.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral thing?	Understanding Check
i would just be so worried that someone would cheat.	Statement
once they leave.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation.	Statement
so knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume you should be able to figure out it's a backchannel and things like that.	Defending/Explanation
and that's just part of how do i get to one place.	Statement
i mean on the uh t t i digits.	Misspeak Self-Correction
but you have different you we're going to have different you know hardware and and	Statement
i think it doesn't affect it.	Reject
that's it for me.	Statement
well actually this was kind of the first try with this spectral subtraction plus smoothing.	Rising Tone
french.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
what is the effect of that?	Expansions of y/n Answers
but there's also there's these tables over here for the for the t i digits and these tables over here for the car data.	Defending/Explanation
we've got some training data we have software that works he's got a method that helps with you know other another task.	Statement
so it could just be that treating them equally treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do.	Floor Grabber
now but the now so so but then the question is	Statement
oh interesting point.	Assessment/Appreciation
which is taking place right now actually.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that people do that one a lot.	Statement
but i had some thoughts about the tandem system.	Statement
that's what i thought too.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
maybe maybe it's no big deal.	Downplayer
so even if it's uh or	Understanding Check
how do you mean do you mean mechanical adaptation or	Or-Question
well i guess you have to do the h t k training also.	Statement
we'll be able to backtrack from email.	Defending/Explanation
are you using the	Yes-No-question
is anybody wearing one of those awful quote crown microphones that people used to be	Yes-No-question
and uh i guess it's sort you know after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me.	Floor Holder
it's very simple smoothing things.	Rising Tone
the yeah a wired one.	Accept
and type what i know.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well he went to put them on	Humorous Material
in terms of energy?	Declarative-Question
uh or something i don't know.	Expansions of y/n Answers
do i do i want to know anything about that object.	Statement
yeah you didn't didn't fall.	Humorous Material
they should do that at bart too.	Statement
what about the um uh the new part of the evaluation?	Wh-Question
well or something.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
this mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization.	Statement
like should we do something more for the noise estimation?	Yes-No-question
and you have a short presentation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah why search for them?	Accept
well i think maybe that's because no one here is sensitive about their age.	Negative Non-no Answers
what's a qual?	3rd-party-talk
the major difference to the munich ones is that we do it via the telephone.	Rising Tone
so i think what would be helpful would be uh and i'll i'll mention this to to liz and andreas too that um before the meeting if anybody could send me any any uh uh agenda items that they were interested in and i'll i'll take the role of organizing them uh into into the agenda.	Offer
i think you we could we could start soon yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um do you think now that it would be this doing it similarly?	Floor Holder
yeah yeah i do too.	Accept
you notice that?	Rising Tone
uh yeah but	Accept-part
so it's not quite as close to half as i'd thought.	Downplayer
well if it if there was a word like right you know then i i would indicate that it happened within the same time frame.	Statement
but i mean it's while i say switchboard uh of course there's only two speakers.	Defending/Explanation
are you looking at these in narrow bands?	Yes-No-question
not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover.	Defending/Explanation
so is this the arrow on the right?	Understanding Check
i have to to to test whether it works first or not.	Statement
uh the next thing is this this v a d problem that	Topic Change
we still have uh this.	About-task
and yep.	Floor Holder
okay so there is some normalization already in that they've been volume equalized uh over the entire signal.	Acknowledge-answer
i think it'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept.	Statement
this was something that stephane suggested.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that would be kind of fun.	Assessment/Appreciation
median yeah.	Collaborative Completion
oh they do.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
test	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but of course we don't have any trained neural nets.	Defending/Explanation
and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it's visual.	Floor Holder
because it it pinches pinches the temples too much.	Defending/Explanation
uh okay we'll quickly do digits.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
using a very small time constant.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and it depends on the order that you're doing.	Defending/Explanation
to download.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's a shame.	Assessment/Appreciation
you got to be the one who you know make sure people recognize that you're the one who's going to speak next.	Expansions of y/n Answers
does it were you saying that uh it it increases to or expands to accommodate that?	Rising Tone
hamming window.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh and then going around the room at the end to just say ask people to mention something interesting that they learned.	Floor Holder
yes we should do that.	Accept
without having her check anything.	Collaborative Completion
but she had said eighty two.	Rising Tone
and also i guess for the speaker.	Expansions of y/n Answers
exactly if it's a manner of speaking then it's useful.	Accept
can can we fast forward through this conversation?	Offer
three words from the end.	Offer
i think we should probably do those.	Offer
well if he's if he's in a car right now	Statement
because what you call a turn and the end of a turn and that it it's horribly confused if you don't sort of	Defending/Explanation
not too well.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah by fifty percent.	Accept
do i need this?	Rising Tone
what did i say?	Rising Tone
someone who's doing discourse would want to do that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um like from start to finish.	Floor Holder
you you don't it doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so which	Wh-Question
can i ask just a a high level question?	Rising Tone
that's his spectral subtraction group?	Declarative-Question
i i i don't i'm i'm just guessing here.	Defending/Explanation
since that that part wasn't	Statement
because it's more interesting for me.	Defending/Explanation
oh you have?	Acknowledge-answer
oh tea time?	Understanding Check
no supervised adaptation.	Reject
same data.	Mimic Other
i mean like the sort of the touristy bits	Expansions of y/n Answers
do they have the same sort of mix down sort of procedure where they start off with a small number of some things?	Yes-No-question
are we going to do them together then?	Understanding Check
well i uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
because you're the grammar maven.	Assessment/Appreciation
just the baseline.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh in the in the p d a you mean?	Understanding Check
you've have you seen this before at all keith these belief net things?	Rising Tone
but it is sort of interesting from	Statement
because if i recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap.	Defending/Explanation
we we might try that some.	Offer
because it's like you know we know that there's no annette on any of the meetings we've ever dealt with.	Defending/Explanation
okay because in one directory there's two versions.	Acknowledge-answer
interesting observation.	Assessment/Appreciation
i'm now i'm confused.	Statement
um yeah it's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to.	Floor Holder
so it's it's a general rule.	Humorous Material
now that we have the data and we have the alignment.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but it sure does get us out of here quicker.	Defending/Explanation
and wouldn't it make sense to do this here too?	Rhetorical-Question
it's amazing how often that happens.	Assessment/Appreciation
was to uh take some period of of of speech and in each band uh develop a histogram.	Statement
but pretty quickly there're they back off.	Statement
no you got what's the other form?	Reject
uh although we're trying to do very well on this evaluation um we actually would like to have something that worked well in general.	Floor Holder
ready?	Understanding Check
but whether maybe just sprinkled through there once in a while something like that might be useful or not.	Offer
oh you're a	Acknowledge-answer
oh i see yeah that that one you can't use because of the delay.	Acknowledge-answer
i think for the purposes of just determining whether a far field microphone uh what the effect of the far field microphone is we should do the same to both.	Offer
this is one of those things that will be debated afterwards?	Understanding Check
and then we talked about that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which produces also site maps.	Understanding Check
because because they most the network group is almost entirely germans and spaniards.	Statement
well uh i think there are two places where it comes up.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
yeah that's without the neural net.	Accept
a new subject.	Statement
i'm sure that everybody i'm sure that other people can hear it.	Statement
sometimes though it does sound like they ended a sentence.	Reject-part
no the supposed bug that was that we were	Reject
so i guess i don't know i mean i guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe there's pauses somehow.	Rising Tone
what's this idea of next tour?	Wh-Question
and i'm thinking of changing that.	Statement
but but there is	Statement
okay sure okay.	Acknowledge-answer
all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today.	Statement
yeah there there i think there are a lot of reasons why it matters.	Floor Grabber
first is the storage it'd be so huge that uh you'd want to be sure that it was of interest to someone.	Defending/Explanation
i mean just by changing the vad itself gives you the a lot of improvement.	Defending/Explanation
so in in an ideal word world if the noise were always the same then when you subtracted it the worst that you would get would be a zero.	Understanding Check
yeah i think for right now um i i i really liked m s g.	Acknowledge-answer
where if a person you know the that there's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that to cut down on the	Expansions of y/n Answers
and uh so the results are like	Floor Holder
so if it's if it's uh not so much envelope based by fine structure based	Statement
i mean they're not going to easily be able to do that probably.	Defending/Explanation
he he said that they were designed for a specific sized head?	Understanding Check
you and i need uh	Statement
i guess my my first comment was um only that um we should not attribute overlaps only to meetings.	Action-directive
and i could probably borrow one.	Offer
no i'll	Reject
i could certainly do that yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i say we give it to l d c and let them do it.	Offer
or is that what is that	Yes-No-question
so this is a very good corpus.	Assessment/Appreciation
because i don't know i uh i don't exactly know what are your results.	Defending/Explanation
the i. ram meeting they they take notes every	Negative Non-no Answers
well e. uh uh if it's a filler.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what are those?	Wh-Question
you can start.	Action-directive
some more.	Collaborative Completion
and leave them loose?	Declarative-Question
i wonder if that was someone who was who had an accent maybe.	Rising Tone
when we want to do recognition we'll do s t m.	Statement
yeah because i was thinking like you're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible.	Floor Holder
uh i was thinking less likely to view.	Dispreferred Answers
oh you're not doing this with our system?	Acknowledge-answer
not using these methods anyway yeah.	Collaborative Completion
and you check to be sure.	Defending/Explanation
like uh uh training different network on different reverberation conditions.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then the the microscope would start moving or something.	Understanding Check
it was in my mail i think also is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone.	Defending/Explanation
at the end.	Expansions of y/n Answers
each of the blue wires.	Collaborative Completion
but it hasn't somehow this somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it.	Statement
because we we are not close to to to zero.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i just saw the eurospeech	Floor Grabber
you want to use some part of what of the time you have.	Rising Tone
oh no	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
um we see that for t i digits m s g perform as well as the p l p.	Rising Tone
and and then you you uh you try to to apply that uh uh uh speech recognizer to that signal to the p d a uh speech file i i think you will have problems because the the the the condition you you will need i i suppose that you will need to to to retrain it.	Statement
it's like kind of like introducing	Statement
no no no uh to to an no an intermediate node.	Dispreferred Answers
and the p.t.a. was in these uh topics about children.	Defending/Explanation
does it matter how much time you use to calculate the mean when you were um doing the training data.	Expansions of y/n Answers
parentheses meaning uncertainty.	Understanding Check
after.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah marcus	Floor Grabber
i mean you can't just normalize it based on the utterance.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah there's nothing going on.	Statement
twelve seconds um counting back from the end of the current frame.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but even if we can't generate it i think it's all right to have some of the sections in your database blank that this information was not collected for this meeting.	Defending/Explanation
and this includes things like going from one sentence into the one utterance into the next one sentence into the next.	Expansions of y/n Answers
something down here?	Collaborative Completion
i have a couple things about speaker form	Rising Tone
easy to talk to.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean you you get some data in you don't know which it is how do you how do you what period of time do you look over to normalize it by?	Or-Question
yeah and test across everything.	Floor Grabber
i'm sure it's just wonderful.	Assessment/Appreciation
maybe since we don't don't have much of a set set agenda.	Defending/Explanation
well the the only thought was if we're going to do a combined corpus does it really matter if some's sampled at one rate and some's sampled at the other?	Rhetorical-Question
and then i do the same.	Rising Tone
do you want to read next?	Rising Tone
maybe it's has something to do to the fact that we don't have infinite training data.	Maybe
so there's between um	Statement
i have a bunch of hours.	Dispreferred Answers
now all our data's going to be	Statement
poverty of the stimulus.	Rising Tone
um yeah and so those are the the two directions that i'm i'm looking into right now.	Floor Holder
so you guys need to start going to the e d u meetings.	Offer
for for insertions?	Declarative-Question
because otherwise what i do when i get these is	Defending/Explanation
since we moved some of the meetings to different directories.	Defending/Explanation
r coloring.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah then it would work.	Accept
it would be a very simple spectral subtraction on the um mel energies.	Rising Tone
have you had that happen?	Rising Tone
it wasn't.	Humorous Material
okay i	Topic Change
yeah that was uh that was what he was saying was this he this thing that uh jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you're talking about.	Floor Grabber
how about o. versus zero?	Wh-Question
um it'd be nice to have something more than that.	Offer
so that's why i was saying getting more sony ones is trivial.	Assessment/Appreciation
it would just it was an intrusion.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um any more on transcript we want to talk about?	Floor Grabber
yeah so chuck helped me out in uh regenerating all the the different channel files for like a few meetings.	Floor Holder
i guess we could have another type of form for less frequent.	Statement
and adding better features i think.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i agree with jane.	Accept
but then he wasn't asked to run it for anybody.	Statement
and so and what about this one?	Rising Tone
made the font smaller and the narrows longer.	Humorous Material
it's very convenient especially if dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and and look in the thing every so often.	Defending/Explanation
acoustically can't you tell?	Dispreferred Answers
and otherwise as part of a grant you can you can do it.	Offer
yeah i looked at some of that stuff.	Accept
so the i mean what i'm hearing is that the problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts is kind of i mean it's not a it's not an unfamiliar problem.	Understanding Check
it's just uh beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting.	Statement
and the idea is these are used to sample um the signal in represented as a time frequency representation.	Rising Tone
so um i i wanted to um maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this.	Floor Holder
actually i wanted to say off line with you about any literature reviews i should do beforehand.	Offer
yeah and it	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so if you can only do that if you have an account at icsi.	Understanding Check
just do this everything that is in this final system except uh use the channel zero.	Statement
others on the um mel energies.	Rising Tone
if people who get nervous about the age question then they realize that oh well but they're not trying to ask me lots of things.	Statement
maybe some other data for that part.	Maybe
how tough can that be?	Rising Tone
you used two thirds of it.	Statement
but the same time uh i can't get most of it.	Statement
it's okay if we say nice things about these people.	Understanding Check
couldn't you couldn't you um test the human performance on just the original audio?	Offer
we're very good at time alignments.	Assessment/Appreciation
that i	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
that's the nice thing.	Assessment/Appreciation
so then you're dealing with ascii.	Defending/Explanation
well yeah so here's here's what's permissible.	Floor Grabber
so it's now universally agreed with.	Expansions of y/n Answers
this is the real thing.	Repeat
and also if it's an expensive place to enter this may also	Statement
and then there are uh there are single microphone methods that i think people have done for uh for this kind of de reverberation.	Statement
or do we have access to that?	Or-Clause
oh well never mind!	Exclamation
things like summarization or what's this meeting about.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but uh i think it's about ten years ago i remember going to one of the speech conferences.	Statement
uh it's like fff sss.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
what what is what is what is this web page from?	Rising Tone
the duration is uh the variation the variation of the duration is uh very big on the	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well you know there is this.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
before that	Repeat
and and they're not going to provide they're not going to provide stress.	Defending/Explanation
i'll try to phrase it in passive voice.	Commit
and it may be a lot more but it may it may not be.	Statement
yeah your battery's going down too.	Floor Grabber
yeah this yeah this number recognition	Acknowledge-answer
so so the cheaper we can do it the better.	Statement
uh i need to email adam or jane.	Floor Holder
gotcha okay.	Acknowledge-answer
so the idea is to uh have a a particular	Understanding Check
oh it was?	Declarative-Question
but other than that you had a huge range of	Statement
um so the only thing i have to do	Statement
because you end up missing entire frames.	Collaborative Completion
uh that's interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
why not just throw all the channels to i b m?	Offer
i mean in terms of the interesting bits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because i had never really transcribed stuff like this before.	Defending/Explanation
and and you also need to look at your web page.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and what are we sitting at currently?	Wh-Question
because eighty nine is bigger than eighty two.	Statement
it's very very surprising.	Assessment/Appreciation
i think you i think it just plugs in a p.c. card.	Statement
in your case if you tried just putting l.d.a. then maybe online normalization.	Offer
and and so when you by the time you click it it'll be right on because it'll go back in time to put the	Defending/Explanation
and that'll be another another uh issue too.	Statement
they agreed.	Expansions of y/n Answers
eighty five?	Understanding Check
it was about half of the	Statement

and one person ended up at the very end doing the digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
a lot of times though the breaths are um results of bad segmentation.	Rising Tone
because because we used x. waves to do the digits.	Defending/Explanation
there's going to be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know.	Statement
it was like one seven.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's uh audible.	Statement
wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something.	Understanding Check
nothing nothing that's sort of far in the future.	Defending/Explanation
in terms of ranking.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh that hurt us.	Assessment/Appreciation

we have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path.	Offer

well voiced speech detector that's working on on the f f t.	Floor Holder
if it just so happens that the e s were a more you know were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something	Statement

um the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
castillian?	Declarative-Question
otherwise they're not allowed to play it for anyone.	Statement
and i think we generally do monitor things like that about whether we whether our utterance will be in the clear or not.	Statement
there we probably have to have a category non american english and then a few choices.	Offer
going through some	Statement
in the some of the earlier meetings i guess there was a lot of spikes.	Rising Tone
you know it just means you have to stop working for dave.	Humorous Material
it would be kind of quick.	Accept-part
so it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something.	Offer
there is uh there is the features uh there's the o g i features and then um those features um go through a contextual uh	Understanding Check
and then you could map those to the timit regions later if people wanted to.	Offer
what is it the um france telecom system uses?	Wh-Question
yeah you could use my machine.	Accept
this is probably channel error stuff.	Understanding Check
so that's something we should try to	Offer
and so and there are a number of places where someone just answered early.	Statement
so it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that adam talked too much or something.	Humorous Material
uh robert do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it's not going off every uh	Floor Grabber
that um thilo requested um that we get some segments done by hand to reduce the size of the time bins.	Statement
well they grow them on trees now.	Humorous Material
i'm not so sure i agree with that.	Negative Non-no Answers
i think that uh trying to duplicate spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing t.i. digits probably isn't too worthwhile.	Negative Non-no Answers
sorry what were you saying?	Apology
it'd	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
right right exactly exactly.	Accept
because the way people use it in these meetings i found was	Defending/Explanation
our our effort would have been devastated.	Humorous Material
and it it clearly hurts.	Statement
oh after.	Acknowledge-answer
there's this question about you know what do you want to scale?	Rhetorical-Question
four hours per meeting.	Acknowledge-answer
so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it's cheaper to to do graduate students.	Reformulate/Summarize
you have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings.	Humorous Material
okay excellent.	Acknowledge-answer
but well huh for the moment they have this large delay on the the feature computation and so we don't	Statement
uh which is we say well this is the way we should do it.	Statement
i mean more if we can.	Offer
uh the box uh there's a half inch lip here.	Floor Grabber
well the there's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you're really not being powered.	Floor Holder
oh okay that's fine.	Acknowledge-answer
well i just wrote down the french site.	Statement
that's a control.	3rd-party-talk
well hang on.	Action-directive
it's actually like five minutes dialogue.	Statement
and what i originally thought was um if you asked someone what was the meeting about	Statement
so currently we've been giving them all weight one fourth.	Statement
i like transcribing you.	Statement
can we do digits?	Rising Tone
now something that i mentioned earlier to mari and liz is that it's probably important to get as many non technical and non speech people as possible.	Statement
that's uh yet yeah by by hand by hand because uh uh why.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
indecipherable.	Collaborative Completion
i think we've run it	Statement
this would never go away.	Humorous Material
i have a question on protocol in these meetings.	Statement
silence all around.	Understanding Check
but i think we should try to get a variety of meetings.	Offer
because i actually think it sort of makes everybody act a little more professional.	Defending/Explanation
not normally.	Dispreferred Answers
right or who's at any point in time who's the foreground speaker.	Accept
is the rough division of	Expansions of y/n Answers

i mean we're still so much in development.	Defending/Explanation
and it's so time consuming.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh because i was i was listening to dan was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking.	Defending/Explanation
we did the back trace at that point.	Statement
we thought that would be a be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing.	Defending/Explanation
yeah so like you were saying like in the case of something with clipping.	Floor Grabber
because i think i've had a couple of tigerfish where i've had to break them up.	Defending/Explanation
uhuh is u.h.u.h.	Defending/Explanation
so what's going to happen is that eventually	Statement
you see because uh because	Defending/Explanation
um i don't know if hari did that or you	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and something	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
native speaking new yorkers as a as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their you know.	Expansions of y/n Answers
italian?	Collaborative Completion
which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be.	Statement
uh the the classifiers of of the to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize uh with uh to transcribe with uh a speech recognizer.	Statement
but i i am i do think that we minimally want something we might want to look at at some some uh subsets of that.	Offer
and i only did one copy which was really stupid of me.	Apology
we have to cut the uh	Statement
the pronunciation models and so forth.	Reformulate/Summarize
um what's our schedule?	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
but it seems like energy energy tells you something.	Defending/Explanation
but but in our meetings people don't say hey because how you doing.	Humorous Material
this is really interesting data.	Statement
we have also started feature combination experiments.	Rising Tone
why do you have to know his name?	Wh-Question
which i don't know enough about to talk about.	Downplayer
how else are you going to distribute them around the tables?	Rhetorical-Question
i need my card key.	Repeat
oh so you not not marked.	Understanding Check
now of course you have this i guess possible danger that somehow there're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff.	Defending/Explanation
because that seems to be pretty common.	Defending/Explanation
and what are these what are the digit strings are from t.i. digits and uh	Wh-Question
i was just going to ask do you want to say any a little bit about it?	Offer
or we simply adopt the uh um more in depth um style that is implemented in the german system.	Rising Tone
in other languages it's more uh important.	Expansions of y/n Answers
to keep it the same but just change them all to channel f?	Understanding Check
tell them to test their mikes or	Offer
should we do our digits?	Offer
or pre echoes.	Misspeak Self-Correction
by the light switch yeah.	Collaborative Completion
uh so that's not something we had thought about before.	Floor Holder
uh so in the data column five has you know one point five compared to seventy nine point six.	Statement
oh definitely yeah.	Accept
but uh when you have uh uh two speakers together without enough silence between between them uh i think uh is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and i i i i x or huh bic criterion for consider all the frames in my opinion.	Offer
i think maybe i'll ask you after the meeting.	Commit
um what is the reverberation time like there?	Wh-Question
how long have you been in an english speaking country.	Understanding Check
like when we went to	Expansions of y/n Answers
you need twelve seconds in the past to estimate right?	Statement
the acoustics.	Collaborative Completion
the word stationary is has a very precise statistical meaning.	Statement
i think we already talked about this last time.	Downplayer
okay so um i guess the argument one might make is that yeah if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh you're not quite sure what to make of it.	Floor Grabber
you mean just the single letter a as in the particle?	Understanding Check
yes she had.	Accept
how long does it take just briefly like to okay to label the	Wh-Question
they're flashing!	Exclamation
it's kind of neat.	Statement
okay i can think of uh people being cheap average or spendy or we can even have a a finer scale moderately cheap.	Offer
and he's really got something.	Defending/Explanation
in the other meetings we have.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but i don't know if you know if sinusoidally uh amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice.	Other Answers
but i you know of certain types.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and there's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the distributions somehow.	Statement
and that that shouldn't be redone.	Statement
but i would also probably put in parentheses it that i thought it was a vocal gesture.	Statement
sorry sorry!	Apology
because we'll we might use use this up uh in some sense.	Defending/Explanation
so it's good.	Assessment/Appreciation
you'll have to just work on little subsets of it.	Statement
uh i don't know about the naming.	Floor Grabber
i will be here full time next week.	Statement
and then suddenly uh people were tired i guess.	Statement
i don't think it does.	Maybe
islands of reliability or whatever it is.	Statement
because you know if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in in sentences.	Defending/Explanation
so i'd so i'd like i'd like to talk about point five.	Statement
that's ideal.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then the top of the overlap.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is this twelve seconds of uh regardless of speech or silence?	Rising Tone
because maybe we could make it a little smaller.	Maybe
to put as much power as you can in the p.d.a.	Understanding Check
and uh and it it is uh very close in performance to the best thing that was there before.	Statement
well the obvious one would be if if you envision this as a module within smartkom where exactly would that sit?	Rising Tone
there's a study done on when people say uh and when people say um.	Rising Tone
right so what i what we seem to need here	Floor Holder
oh it's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but a lot of the	Statement
so that it'll work on all the n t machines.	Defending/Explanation
and how certain the boundary is.	Statement
but my general goal when there was sufficient space room pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling gap.	Statement
but i did i was thinking you know it is interesting to me to think about how each each of us have sampled different meetings.	About-task
uh nnn.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and it goes along it with this sliding window calculating the mean using the data in the window.	Statement
but other than that it's not bad at all.	Assessment/Appreciation
because that's actually my interest at the moment so.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i'm thinking that	Acknowledge-answer
psst want to buy a corpora.	Statement
touche.	Assessment/Appreciation
are they from one of the foreign language ones?	Rising Tone
so we could probably get more as well.	Statement
i didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language uh the function model as sort of relevant.	Statement
and i'm not sure if if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration.	Other Answers
mix?	Collaborative Completion
so they should be ready.	Rising Tone
you know all the way through every meeting for about eighty percent of the stuff that i've cleared so far.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um for some more money to do more data.	Floor Holder
because as you notice in the paper your m.o. four in one meeting.	Defending/Explanation
contribute the data.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but but that was read speech.	Negative Non-no Answers
it's like how could they do that.	Statement
that was really a kick.	Assessment/Appreciation
before we get more into details.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um no the question was really geared towards trying to get people's self evaluation of their dialect region.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
hats.	Offer
people with harry drove the car into the cafe.	Rising Tone
i'm going to try training on a larger data set.	Commit
or expound on it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
with with a	Expansions of y/n Answers
that took a	Statement
like you can parse command line arguments.	Defending/Explanation
what's it written in?	Wh-Question
i mean i think the question on regions is really to ask people how did they define their dialect region now.	Offer
because you can search the transcripts you know for for that to find these places.	Defending/Explanation
i don't have good result.	Repeat
so i don't know why the well matched is	Other Answers
will you get the door?	Offer
really enjoy that.	Assessment/Appreciation
and then they they get a c d but just not the same day.	Offer
okay so that's that's this bottom one.	Statement
uh and then yeah that's	Statement
appreciate that.	Thanking
well i was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the u. dub to see	Offer
yeah they they don't have a way.	Accept
and then we need a couple that of we don't want to just have one group.	Action-directive
for the minimum silence length.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so it improves.	Dispreferred Answers
but i.d.'s.	Misspeak Self-Correction
oh that's fine.	Acknowledge-answer
it's it's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it.	Statement
which he said.	Expansions of y/n Answers
if you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters uh	Offer
i i i want to introduce my reservoir dogs solution again which is everyone has like mister white mister pink mister blue.	Offer
so again if this if these new segmentations work okay then we then it's a fair it's a completely fair test.	Floor Grabber
so um someone else did that too.	Floor Holder
yeah i have a real problem with that.	Accept
but we what we	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah i assume.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so we just run that one	Understanding Check
oh that's a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
right because sometimes you'll hear it'll be in right in the middle of the timebin.	Floor Grabber
well the d t d's mean we can do whatever however we want it.	Downplayer
send so if you could just email me them.	Action-directive
yeah yeah i mean it's only going to affect my work.	Accept
network.	Offer
what about transcribing it um h.m.p. h?	Wh-Question
i guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside?	Open-Question
well but then you could you could prompt them to say you know other than your action item	Offer
i think also the harmonics would be very important.	Offer
the the cepstrum coefficient.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you're going to be you're going to be saying you know funnier things.	Humorous Material
and the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to uh uh determine through magical means that that uh there's no speech in some period.	Offer
and then you do this	Statement
or maybe not.	Collaborative Completion
and who would prefer amaretto?	Rising Tone
well i didn't know about liz's finding on that.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
that that makes sense.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so you can imagine building many of these detectors on different features.	Statement
we could cut we know what else we could cut down on the neural net time.	Offer
actually i think i've done it a fair number of times today.	Statement
i wasn't saying it wasn't.	Defending/Explanation
and so i would like to get that done as quickly as possible.	Statement
because that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in uh this other estimate.	Statement
uh it really depends.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time.	Defending/Explanation
but no they're i mean they're sort of this is where tour becomes you know	Dispreferred Answers
no he's completely going to rewrite everything in java.	Reject
backchannels.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah but what i mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the h h m k's.	Acknowledge-answer
it's it's it's fun.	Assessment/Appreciation
now what about in a meeting that you said we've you've had some more trouble with?	Open-Question
i just want to be at the head of the table.	Humorous Material
i think that it's fine.	Assessment/Appreciation
well but seriously i i mean morgan's obviously in a bind over this.	Negative Non-no Answers
yeah this is a good time for me.	Dispreferred Answers
not five p m three p m.	Dispreferred Answers
different level prosody and all that sort of stuff.	Misspeak Self-Correction
right anyway uh so i i i couldn't judge whether this was original or not.	Accept
but um um it's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a viterbi alignment.	Defending/Explanation
and do the opposite.	Action-directive
i mean we had certainly in our you know the proposal that we tried to make to n.s.f. we were assuming we would distribute this through the l.d.c.	Defending/Explanation
to the previous meeting that's right.	Collaborative Completion
right so i it seems to me that if you read this form i it's pretty obvious that it's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak.	Accept
not quite a slam.	Assessment/Appreciation
well that might help a bit.	Assessment/Appreciation
no it's compared to the word it's improvement on the word error rate.	Reject
and then later on down the line i can start playing with the the models themselves.	Statement
the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure.	Rising Tone
i mean they're something.	Defending/Explanation
but it's starting to look like it it's almost the opposite of the usual situation where um you get some really nice result with uh with digits say.	Statement
because we are interested in some spatial processing.	Defending/Explanation
so some of these were backchannels and things like that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
if this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly?	Rising Tone
yep let them have their meeting.	Acknowledge-answer
how do you do that?	Rising Tone
but i think it's more efficient if we have the storage space to have the small ones.	Offer
well if you have	Statement
then the log operation.	Rising Tone
i think that would be really interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah yeah you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah right now we are	Floor Grabber
well i mean so the wavefiles or or anything at all because the transcripts are there as well?	Understanding Check
corpus of spoken american english.	Defending/Explanation
it's actually not a bad idea to say beep as a word.	Assessment/Appreciation
now does it have the same sort of behavior as p. make?	Yes-No-question
any other difference?	Expansions of y/n Answers
so that's what we're really doing.	Statement
or eight dollars.	Misspeak Self-Correction
do you want to um access view or enter a thing?	Rhetorical-Question
just to just to start off that way.	Defending/Explanation

got the fifth?	Understanding Check
i guess yeah.	Accept
which was done in the log domain.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well no you should do it you should do it do it again from scratch.	Offer
i think the beep is a really good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
it would be considered as an overlap in the first one.	Dispreferred Answers
you know it's close enough i guess to huh you know.	Statement
so i i think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people but if they happen to generate minutes could could they send it to us.	Offer
it's it's it's taking the finding the roots of the l.p.c. polynomial.	Dispreferred Answers
i i don't yet know how to do this.	Other Answers
i mean how are they going to you know what's what's the distribution plan?	Rhetorical-Question
do you want to start morgan?	Offer
i think that fits in well with the whole meeting map mapping meetings concept is that's another way of looking at looking at it.	Assessment/Appreciation
that'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured.	Defending/Explanation
if you look at what j. rasta doing essentially it's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise.	Defending/Explanation
do is this a uh university project?	Rising Tone
in neither case.	Dispreferred Answers
and the end of that unit like question answer pair could be a different speaker.	Defending/Explanation
but you know in in sort of random polling	Rising Tone
you know they're saying uh one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh but in in the current thing for instance where you have this well matched moderately matched and and highly mismatched uh the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well matched but it's only a a marginal.	Floor Holder
ten on ten different databases.	Statement
oh well that's there's an easy way to do that.	Humorous Material
it's it's a sub categorization.	Statement
but just i replace their noise estimate by this one.	Statement
is is things that the wrong material but the right the right source.	Expansions of y/n Answers
a thousand times?	Collaborative Completion
channel zero is the close microphone.	Statement
and and uh we said uh take a week go arm wrestle.	Action-directive
and i'll put it together.	Commit
yeah i am.	Accept
so we should perhaps just select meetings on which the speech nonspeech detection works well.	Offer
and also um it varying when they change their head position.	Expansions of y/n Answers
they they looked ahead a little bit.	Accept-part
i mean i mean we talked about sending around a disk or a computer.	Statement
just do whatever.	Action-directive
no but i was asking if that was something you really cared about.	Reject
and we can meet.	Offer
it only sounds good when you scream it though.	Repeat
the the other thing what i tried was the adding the uh endpoint information to the baseline.	Statement
with uh a exact mark.	Statement
so that's the single existing convention for okay.	Statement
we did a switch right?	Understanding Check
three hundred and thirty.	Statement
so i i i think i think that's that's okay.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's you took some actions you spent money and stuff.	Statement
you were also thinking about the same tool?	Declarative-Question
because maybe we have different requirements in terms of time you know how much time aligned detail we need and uh how much detail in terms of people.	Defending/Explanation
did it sound good?	Rising Tone
so i'm saying there are going to be what i imagine once we've collected a lot of data a chunk of it will be uh the same people many times.	Statement
robert took what?	Signal-non-understanding
and you can do something immediately.	Rising Tone
what did it sound like?	Wh-Question
so it was on p.l.p. derived cepstral coefficients.	Statement
about one percent.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah that's actually a really good idea.	Accept
just take the thing with you.	Action-directive
so will the application the meeting recorder application work?	Yes-No-question
right so i mean if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there that that uh might be good.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah so basically right as you walk in the door the one straight ahead of you is amaretto.	Floor Grabber
it was just to talk about how to generate it.	Defending/Explanation
you probably do.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
not changed.	Statement
yeah i i guess my point is that um in some of the work he's doing in reverberation one of the things that we're finding is that uh it's it's for the for an artificial situation we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well.	Floor Grabber
that for instance after	Statement
yep okay.	Continuer
because if you're if you want to speak next it's almost like you got you got to get your foot in the door.	Defending/Explanation
but is there some we can collectively think of some of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of of just	Offer
but that's going to be only temporary.	Negative Non-no Answers
it's terrible.	Humorous Material
the user budget.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so then one distinction is that uh you were taking the actual france telecom features and then applying something to	Understanding Check
as long as it's clear.	Statement
now would do we have a number i suppose for the matched	Yes-No-question
um are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel?	Floor Holder
the my what in this in this situation is my forte which is english.	Statement
and uh then you'd have a more your normal kind of meeting.	Defending/Explanation
one sort of unexpected result there is that uh two party telephone conversations have about the same amount of overlap.	Statement
well i i think i see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about?	Reformulate/Summarize
i did an archive.	Statement
in fact it was.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but to get to get a good quality i mean if if you were listening to it downstairs that one's quite a bit lower quality.	Defending/Explanation
and then let's pick it.	Offer
what what what are they looking at?	Wh-Question
maybe you don't.	Self-talk
and just be sure you say both digits separately.	Action-directive
and how we can change them.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like uh do you remember which case?	Yes-No-question
and i'm adam janin on channel a. .	Rising Tone
what looked different?	Wh-Question
um i guess since this is development data it's legitimate to do more than one.	Floor Holder
uh we don't know yet i i think.	Other Answers
which is good.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's just it's just kind of cute.	Assessment/Appreciation
just cross correlation between two sides.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
see how different these sequences of numbers are.	Humorous Material
did we look at the german?	Rising Tone
so it's it has the overall overall energy.	Statement
and even though there's eight cables they're not really very big around.	Statement
the vocal	Statement
actually that's the the one people usually use ten x. .	Statement
well actually i think it is worth doing.	Assessment/Appreciation
plus plus eighty for the neural net and p c a.	Statement
i guess i'm such a perfectionist that i sort of combine the two when i'm checking.	Rising Tone
do you mean	Understanding Check
and then what the action planner does with it?	Open-Question
um i don't know what you call it.	Other Answers
i should have brought more	Self-talk
oh so that's	Acknowledge-answer
but uh is	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so it seems like um if you and jane	Statement
that model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits.	Statement

it takes a very long time.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
when he creates these.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um my my my impression is that it's better for meetings with fewer speakers.	Accept-part
and get rid of these uh the wired stuff completely.	Statement
well a vector with three zeroes and one one.	Understanding Check
um well i got a email from one of the u w guys.	Floor Grabber
great great thanks thanks.	Assessment/Appreciation
and each sentence on the average has four or five digits?	Declarative-Question
i mean how many how many how many meetings?	Wh-Question
it's you know?	Declarative-Question
um to train the s r i system on digits s andreas used the original t i digits.	Floor Holder
so what how is the uh interaction supposed to happen?	Wh-Question
and it wouldn't have been an awkward place to stop.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so we go from eighty eighty eight point six to to ninety or something.	Understanding Check
huh i've been looking at the uh aurora data and um first first look at it there were basically three directories on there that could be moved.	Statement
why why do it?	Wh-Question
well you could distinguish between pre five and five five to twelve.	Understanding Check
yeah but we have the models so we could get that number.	Floor Grabber
is it this one?	Rising Tone
and you know if we if we do and we probably will actually try to uh build a prototype uh	Statement
is that about right you think?	Rising Tone
so i should maybe listen to that stuff again.	Commit
i mean i i share her intuition that's it's it is sort of unusual to have so used as a final uh part of a person's turn.	Statement
couldn't you just also i mean if you know that the the largest latency in the system is two hundred milliseconds don't you couldn't you just buffer up that number of frames?	Yes-No-question
uh and so uh and so i was proceeding somewhat at random frankly.	Floor Holder
so do you create this continuous stream from the individual utterance files?	Rising Tone
boy it's such a nice interface.	Assessment/Appreciation
if not you know then that's also something um that we can't really	Statement
did you do any recognition on the mix mix out?	Rising Tone
and frame dropping.	Defending/Explanation
or is it you know is it	Statement
so you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally.	Statement
um then of course the uh um you know	Floor Holder
no no actually it was fast enough.	Reject
so i uh just just for clarification.	About-task
if the	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
or i could just add them up and get a different total.	Humorous Material
oh like the region?	Understanding Check
sure so we don't want to like give them all equal weight.	Accept
i guess that's it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so you mean you're just using a mean and the and a variance.	Understanding Check
you pick on something that looks like it's promising.	Expansions of y/n Answers
sort of it's it helps if it points sort of upwards.	Offer
so in some ways it's good to have data driven things.	Floor Holder
well it is.	Reject
so i'll just i was just looking at the bottom of page three there.	Topic Change
many come to mind.	Statement

what was what's the the parenthesized stuff that says like the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight?	Wh-Question
so it looks to me i guess the same.	Reformulate/Summarize

so it seems to me that you know if you take away the the the difference of this primary features and say you use as we had talked about maybe doing you use p. rasta p.l.p. or something for the the primary features um then this feature discovery uh uh thing is just what he's talking about doing too.

and like i was saying i think the you know the basic directions are uh uh i mean there's lots of little things such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and uh the second stream and then uh improving the v a d.	Statement
so it we can regenerate a lot of this information.	Collaborative Completion
because now i'm looking at this and i realize i don't know the answer.	Defending/Explanation
how they	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so the question is what	Wh-Question
and then we have results that are not um very impressive.	Assessment/Appreciation
you have this block.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i mean you were doing a lot of changes.	Floor Grabber
because you have a bunch more bandwidth.	Defending/Explanation
here yet yet i i i i i think i i think uh there are that some kind of noises that uh don't don't wanted to to be in that uh in that control set.	Reject-part

and uh it was common problem that you'd	Statement
had she changed her perfume?	Rising Tone
the original application doesn't really	Statement
well but the good thing is we we could have loopy belief propagation which we all love.	Floor Grabber
the language model will be certainly be different.	Statement
so you specify one of these things for every one of those possible situations.	Understanding Check
or or you're looking at six sec seconds in future and six in	Or-Clause
um the well match is forty medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty five.	Floor Holder
shirts.	Offer
so it's these are just microphone	Statement
because for discourse you don't need the audio.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or i mean is the intention to do some	Or-Clause
so then an more than one utterance is there um there's often uh pause between it.	Rising Tone
a person says huh kay.	Expansions of y/n Answers
why don't you just ask joe but c c hari and then in the note say hari hopefully this is okay with you?	Offer
i think blindfolds.	Offer
tickle is pronounced tickle?	Signal-non-understanding
should we do uh simultaneous digits so that we actually have time for tea?	Rising Tone
i guess what you could do maybe	Offer
any other items?	Rising Tone
yeah i would just sort of end it.	Accept
or is it done on the f.f.t. bins?	Or-Clause
the linguistic data consortium.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well open up object type and let's see what its values are.	Action-directive
and so in the case where um it had a better score the silence model expected duration was much longer.	Statement
well if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time	Offer
well it's the fifth page i guess.	3rd-party-talk
a sleeping policeman.	Statement
uh so this is training the net on french only.	Floor Holder
the multi c.p.u. one.	Statement
i think if we if we want to just record with the tabletop microphones that's easy.	Statement
because they're kind of a captive audience.	Defending/Explanation
but i but i that's that's a long way from now and and it's a matter of between now and then of of deciding how.	Statement
if we use the the little the conventions that jane has established i have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention.	Statement
yeah well there's going to be these student projects that can do some things.	Floor Grabber
yeah actually i think at nist they were there were there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too.	Floor Grabber
uh so institutionally we were we were second with uh the third third system.	Floor Holder
because then you can figure out the percentages.	Defending/Explanation
oh oh you mean the the quals.	Acknowledge-answer
but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things.	Statement
would you say it's another shrug?	Repeat
that that one.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but little bit by bit yeah.	Misspeak Self-Correction
what's the allowable?	Rising Tone
well trying with and with and without yeah.	Offer
yeah because there are always people like you know talking bad about the transcribers.	Accept
i mean who wants to do that though?	Defending/Explanation
i really liked that.	Statement
and the beam forming	Statement
onset detector okay.	Acknowledge-answer
uh because there's many features that are still preserved.	Defending/Explanation
that must have been suspenseful.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's like the noisy uh um like airflow ones where you've got like a a stoppage in your mouth.	Rising Tone
and uh thirteen point seven.	Statement
and and just to finish this that um that i think that there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already in the fray.	Statement
really.	Continuer
because i think it's so funny.	Defending/Explanation
because it's in the future.	Defending/Explanation
he is he cheap average or spendy?	Or-Question
we can just rename that yeah.	Accept
what did i just press here?	Wh-Question
i've got to ask you so uh the difference between the top two	Statement
i mean that's why they use like i	Statement
well do we have the do we have the processed data?	Or-Question
and so one of the things i did was i compiled h t k for the linux machines.	Statement
just shoot.	Understanding Check
and so uh at that point we'll be able to record five more meetings.	Floor Holder
while our system is currently at seven percent.	Defending/Explanation
he does it a lot.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
whereas this sounds like a more general solution.	Defending/Explanation
and uh and then also a lot of the fancy user interface stuff that's in transcriber i haven't done.	Statement
oh we're we're we're live.	Acknowledge-answer
so the baseline itself improves by fifty percent.	Understanding Check
is it wrong?	Collaborative Completion
yeah that seems like a good thing to do probably.	Floor Grabber
because that's not i mean i was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer.	Defending/Explanation
do we have anything like an agenda?	Rising Tone
well it's just we're missing tea.	Accept-part
so which one do you prefer?	Wh-Question
it's it's on the order of eight to ten.	Defending/Explanation
that's true it's it's really difficult.	Assessment/Appreciation
that's certainly what's going to come out of uh of our group first.	Statement
i mean you can pretend it's all from one speaker.	Downplayer
the one we're wearing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's not we we it's a	Statement
p r n.	Collaborative Completion
but it seems like maybe you disagree.	Rising Tone
and then two dots.	Rising Tone
yeah i mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so go ahead jeremy.	Action-directive
to keep going with the meeting.	Collaborative Completion
and here's the you know here are the pronunciations and go to it.	Statement
um and compared the two.	Rising Tone
yeah i i agree.	Repeat
and then what you and i have to talk about is okay if we're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined.	Action-directive
and i'm just wondering uh i mean for our transcripts we may want to do that.	Statement
i was just going to say maybe fifteen minutes later would help me a little bit.	Accept-part
tape?	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
that's another thing is if you're not a native speaker of english you might not pick up.	Statement
what kinds of what what makes sense to do with that feature?	Wh-Question
so if if we can put something	Offer
you know there's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing and if you can capture it when there's overlap then you should do quite well there.	Statement
similar probably to what we do in switchboard but with better bandwidth.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh but you know it's four to the fourth.	Floor Holder
is because of the of the filtering.	Defending/Explanation
well i think that if if we're planning to do that then we should probably have another set of forms.	Offer
yeah because when we apply the k l t	Accept
i don't know if there were fifty.	Downplayer
so that's a close talking and a lapel and then two environmental mikes.	Understanding Check
cross cross correlation.	Collaborative Completion
if we have nothing if we have no agenda we could do it some week.	Offer
yeah because it's um bilabial too.	Floor Grabber
and it's british.	Statement
some things are going to be hurt.	Statement
oh so they will send files.	Acknowledge-answer
there's there's not anybody o g i currently who's who's uh working with this.	Statement
and that's about because you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the	Defending/Explanation
and what they did finally is to huh uh not to align the utterances but to perform recognition.	Statement
yeah as we mentioned timit is the only that's hand labeled.	Floor Grabber
the primary features um are in fact	Statement
and i think that's the right thing to do.	Assessment/Appreciation
well it's not too much.	Downplayer
we could just ask the someone like the front desk person or lila to like set aside a little bit for us.	Offer
but i should read the paper.	Downplayer
absolutely so i think we're going to have to start with keywords.	Accept
and they have to like put them into their discussion.	Defending/Explanation
no no no there's some i mean i just there are there are a lot of a lot of these things.	Reject
that's a fine question.	Assessment/Appreciation
after after uh they were put in there i didn't really look at them anymore.	Statement
well i that's hard to generate.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
that's true that's true.	Accept
because it you know it's really annoying if you go through all that trouble.	Defending/Explanation
and so this this past week um i've been uh looking a little bit into uh traps um and doing doing traps on on these events too.	Statement
uh but is it exactly the same system?	Rising Tone
yeah like that.	Accept
uh i guess you know we we recently woke up um our friends.	Rising Tone
so so to address what what adam's saying	Statement
given that the overlaps are up up uh where the difficulty comes in a bunch of areas um whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule?	Offer
so right now it's one hundred and forty milliseconds.	Statement
was that somewhere where they were going to say new speaker or something?	Or-Question
but really getting close.	Assessment/Appreciation
because it does take time to put those markings in.	Defending/Explanation
yeah that that's good.	Statement
or are they using multiple dats?	Or-Clause
you've also gone through the use the introduction of the pre segmentation and that kind of thing.	Statement
your mike is	3rd-party-talk
i didn't know about that.	Other Answers
but it seems like um the anonymization is uh is also something that we might want to discuss in greater length.	Offer
so basically that's just um trying to propose um uh your next your your following years of of your p.h.d. work.	Defending/Explanation
to set it up and then anonymize it.	Defending/Explanation
yeah well it does creep up.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
or was there	Or-Clause
huh since the meeting	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
that would be interesting to see whether that helps.	Assessment/Appreciation
so the guenter was arguing that i mean even if you have a very good v a d averaging it like over the whole thing is not a good idea.	Statement
i didn't know we were going to be recording this meeting.	Defending/Explanation
uh i think i'll start from the post uh aurora submission maybe.	Commit
in other words it's it it'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all.	Defending/Explanation
there's a lip in these tables.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
you won't be able to do anything.	Defending/Explanation
first of all h t k sorry s the s r i system is doing channel adaptation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and they can use it for their research.	Statement
oh so okay.	Accept
so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions.	Reformulate/Summarize
but you had to figure out where the heck in the meeting to to look for them.	Defending/Explanation
so we have total number of meetings is seventy eight meetings.	Statement
they'd be they'd be separate.	Offer
and you guys are giving talks on tomorrow and wednesday lunch times.	Understanding Check
well that that's the way people sit.	Dispreferred Answers
and so we'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also.	Statement
and where that was we had to use the forced alignment uh results from for.	Statement
because then you know you get like if you get a span of five words that's easy.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly.	Action-directive
sunil's here for the summer?	Understanding Check
well and some people would give you more specific information than others.	Negative Non-no Answers
these six tables here with with little boxes sort of uh in the middle here.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and and software too.	Offer
but i think i'll just run through it also and see if someone thinks it's inaccurate or uh insufficient.	Commit
and identify the speaker.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i guess you know i don't want to keep you.	About-task
that'd be cool actually.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh for the test it's just twelve seconds in the past.	Dispreferred Answers
so it it's it's not systematically queued.	Statement
or something like that?	Or-Clause
there was this business that you know we we could use up the full forty eight hundred bits.	Understanding Check
yeah our neural net.	Accept
so that i can interpret the numbers if i compared that with a forced alignment segmentation.	Defending/Explanation
i want to go back and listen to minute forty one.	Commit
and maybe maybe some uh intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um that the neural net learns.	Statement
and here discourse um	Statement
and then um i guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question.	Floor Holder
well that's good.	Assessment/Appreciation
and yet it's intriguing to me to think that if i were to describe someone's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns i bet you we would all agree on who it who it was.	Statement
and then you would listen to it.	Rising Tone
but it would be great if you could um not transcribe it all but pick out uh some stuff.	Offer
a tenth of a per cent.	Understanding Check
and um and they have you know a lot of	Floor Holder
and well basically compute features and not nnn features without noise i mean uh transform the noisy features in other features that are not noisy.	Offer
those	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i guess you know i've been using in the ear walkman headphones for you know a long time.	Defending/Explanation
and either correct them or have them reread.	Statement
you're almost done.	Rising Tone
it's also it's not it's not near far right?	Understanding Check
there's no sound out right now.	Negative Non-no Answers
and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow.	Statement
be polite or whatever.	Collaborative Completion
you're going to have to just get	Offer
this was a a difficult person to to understand.	Statement
and see where where the where they were different and what we can learn from it.	Offer
whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just want to go there to look at it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but i think it's it's it's a real uh it's a real learning experience for both of us.	Assessment/Appreciation
and he's going to look into trying to run some things that are out there.	Statement
and not somebody	Defending/Explanation
and then just uh use it on a reduced test set or something.	Offer
yeah in the very beginning.	Accept
not all.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like uh um so in other words blah blah blah blah.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because with the close talking mikes the the signal will be so much stronger.	Defending/Explanation
so does any of this matter?	Rising Tone
it's what i do anyway.	Statement
maybe i was missing something maybe.	Statement
people are very picky about this.	Defending/Explanation
definitely should.	Offer
because you know what what what james is going to be doing is looking at the user interface.	Defending/Explanation
because there's lots of interesting problems of course.	Defending/Explanation
set the negative values to zero.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the size that we have?	Understanding Check
well there's i'm sure there's going to be more discussion on that after your talk.	Rising Tone
some people are transcribing it as a breath.	Rising Tone
and and so where do you get your thresholds from?	Wh-Question
okay so there is kind of summary of what has been done.	Floor Grabber
because we could probably move it one hour later.	Offer
it's just easier to read.	Assessment/Appreciation
i believe that's correct yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but in terms of speaker change it might be nice to get the actual time.	Reject-part
is that it's clear if you know it.	Statement
so they they look at	Statement
because we have eighty eight point six.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i mean for the for the um acoustic research	Floor Grabber
uh and it's point eight.	Understanding Check
and using less c p u was better.	Statement
and just going to say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we're working on.	Rising Tone
okay that's what i'm asking.	Defending/Explanation
if i was if i was here and morgan was there and we were both talking it wouldn't work.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
lipsmack.	Statement
i should say i didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions.	Downplayer
your grandmother.	Offer
the person don't get it.	Dispreferred Answers
and goes on till minute so-and-so.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because you're very polite.	Defending/Explanation
okay so uh i just want to make sure i understand what we need to run.	Floor Grabber
how do you mean expand?	Wh-Question
so potentially if he came up with something that was useful like a a better noise estimation module or something he could ship it to you guys up there.	Statement
and otherwise they should mark it so that we can check.	Offer
yeah it was.	Accept
because you get these funny values in in real speech.	Defending/Explanation
um one thing uh uh just a uh uh an announcement of sorts is that um chuck is going to be going to a meeting at nist.	Floor Grabber
on on meeting recording.	Expansions of y/n Answers
do you think we should send the um that whole meeting to them and not worry about pre processing it?	Offer
in fact	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i mean our approach somehow i mean i believe it's probably you know complimentary in many ways is to focus on the actual deep technology that we have somehow in speech and basically make progress on you know the algorithms.	Defending/Explanation
so you know what does this look like.	Statement
so we have uh to try to get rid of these this problem.	Statement
and that's what causes the latency?	Declarative-Question
was is it in a in a what what is the	Wh-Question
take control.	Humorous Material
so i would i would then shift the focus to um something like switchboard.	Floor Holder
i mean if we could do the the more fine grained tuning of this uh using an algorithm that would be so much more efficient.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but we should still be able to somehow say what what is the added contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person or something like that.	Statement
but i but i have a	Statement
we were are thinking about just kind of uh taking the spectrum.	Offer
and roughly independent errors.	Floor Holder
right neither would i.	Acknowledge-answer
well there's also the normalization.	Statement
because the the the uh cheap head mounteds all require low voltage.	Defending/Explanation
ask dan ellis.	Offer
what's uh the original transcriber written in?	Wh-Question
because i think it's sort of safe.	Defending/Explanation
to do the same kind of correction.	Misspeak Self-Correction
they wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run the system on the wall street journal uh data.	Statement
i'll ask	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so they uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and my experience with that in broadcast news was usually combining at other levels works better.	Assessment/Appreciation
no they're events.	Accept
out of curiosity what what kind of recognizer is the one from mississippi state?	About-task
so you couldn't get any clues from volume that you know he was really far away from this conversation.	Defending/Explanation
we have what what do we have?	Rising Tone
uh you know if occasionally uh somebody hits the table or something you could get a spike.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's tricky.	Statement
i mean the other thing i was going to suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with uh different time constants.	Offer
which is that you know if you run something on somebody's machine and they come in and hit a key then it	Expansions of y/n Answers
well people are very flexible you know i mean so when we did this last week i felt that you know now andreas may uh uh he he sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something and and because he missed something then he missed the the initial introduction of who we were talking about and was was unable to do the tracking.	Defending/Explanation
these uh these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the m three l structure in an sort of subfield that we have reserved.	Rising Tone
you could yeah.	Accept
but then you're going to get results that are worse on account of not doing proper speaker normalization.	Defending/Explanation
like uh speaks an asian language.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no i think that's fine.	Reject
but there is a standard pay scale.	Statement
if somebody said something like boy i'm really tired okay and then started reading that would be on a separate line.	Understanding Check
if it didn't if it didn't hurt you know if it was comfortable but you knew it was there would it bother you?	Rising Tone
this is very fast this this really runs quickly.	Assessment/Appreciation
and that way it's not additive.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah the time of day.	Accept
that is an earphone so if you just put it so it's on your ear.	Action-directive
it's it's absolutely against the law to use a tool.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend?	Understanding Check
l.d.a.	Acknowledge-answer
i mean this thing wearing that that can	Yes-No-question
um uh one more thing.	Statement
and time bins.	Mimic Other
ooo no.	Reject
so right now the what you're doing is you're taking the uh the original version.	Understanding Check
so here's the tower.	Statement
have you did you look at the u r l?	Rising Tone
is it rare?	Yes-No-question
well so um	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
as long as they're as they're different strings that we that'll make our sort of processing more robust.	Statement
um yeah so it seems for the the well match and mismatched condition.	Floor Holder
so then maybe we should try to bring people here.	Offer
uh if it's on the server side it you probably don't have to worry too much about size.	Defending/Explanation
and that was like a stroop test in some ways.	Statement
and and perhaps i was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single k l t.	Offer
do we want to try to combine channels somehow to make the transcriber's job easier?	Yes-No-question
not be as careful.	Expansions of y/n Answers
let's pick a different word.	Humorous Material
just to archive.	Expansions of y/n Answers
there's a lot of okay's.	Assessment/Appreciation
but i don't know if that's really a fair way of comparing between multi party conversations and two party conversations.	Dispreferred Answers
right and i was going to email them the which i haven't yet a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have.	Acknowledge-answer
do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on tuesday?	Or-Question
uh maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first fifteen frames more heavily than than was done in your first attempt.	Offer
um so uh let's see we were having a discussion the other day maybe we should bring that up about uh the nature of the data that we are collecting.	Floor Holder
i don't think that we should break eric's sentences for those i think.	Statement
so the one from the m l p and the one from the energy based with the with the and operator.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but excuse me but you could bleep out just the names.	Accept-part
what's the idea behind	Rising Tone
look at the errors.	Commit
so it's optional?	Understanding Check
and then suddenly they'll say something that they only just sort of chuckle at.	Defending/Explanation
and also to check the file.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that'd be more like the j. rasta thing in a sense.	Statement
uh repeated you know repeated words is another of that kind of disfluencies and so forth.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh file reorganization.	About-task
and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers.	Offer
i mean you can just use the microphone and take the headband off.	Offer
well i didn't mark anything else as specifically optional.	Statement
it would be interesting in itself to see.	Statement
so there's a two	Statement
aw thanks.	Thanking
it's like a it's a sleeping policeman.	Statement
yep jane and i discussed this and it was it was again the same problem.	Floor Grabber
oh is this i.b. m?	Acknowledge-answer
we need to finish this discussion and you.	Offer
only when it was otherwise going to be puzzling.	Accept-part
uhhuh the i agree.	Accept
i i added a few people who didn't who i knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me.	Statement
you don't think they'd just leave it blank if it says has a big optional right next to it?	Understanding Check
do we have more to talk about?	Rising Tone
the the shift in	Understanding Check
but uh you know.	Floor Holder
or how are they using more than half i guess maybe is what i	Statement
i mean most people you know after this evaluation and conference should be working on these type of things at least.	Defending/Explanation
so you can do you know uh have a complete story of of some piece of dialogue.	Offer
didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment?	Rising Tone
well let's first of all let's see if it does influence anything.	Action-directive
uh last week you were doing this stuff with pierre you were you were mentioning.	Floor Holder
no never mind.	Downplayer
and um so i i been i been thinking about that.	Floor Holder
and then the c.m.u. folks and i were sort of on the other side in	Statement
and that's sort of what srini is working on in in in the daml uh project where um you you find a g i s about that gives you information on berkeley.	Rising Tone
oh are we?	Rising Tone
in your new machine.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's somewhat that's somewhat subject to error.	Statement
the sun rack takes one took four and one took six or maybe it was eight and twelve whatever it was it was you know fifty per cent more.	Statement
oh you oh you are.	Acknowledge-answer
and then back in here	Statement
yeah so so that's the that's the first part uh one one of the ideas to get at some some patterns of intermediate categories.	Floor Holder
it's been through the double check.	Understanding Check
yeah there there's the um practice talk.	Accept
so if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech there's going to be a a big informative area there it seems to me.	Statement
which is like one percent still less than what you got using the french telecom system.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like what else is is do you want?	Rising Tone
what was the total we ended up with through the whole system?	Wh-Question
we can just catch it at the catch everything at this side.	Offer
especially because also in the beginning meetings i mean he'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand.	Statement
and you know there are other places where it's in the way you know	Offer
are are we going to try and	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah it's one percent.	Accept
so uh what were we going to talk about again?	Floor Holder
okay i also wrote a script which will um retrieve anything in curly brackets or anything which i've classified as an acronym.	Floor Grabber
i noticed as far as problems with laughs is that a lot of them were marked as breaths.	Statement
so that that's that's true.	Accept
i'll do that on the next set of forms.	Commit
and then uh doing some explicit	Statement
vocal tract thing.	Statement
so that you're okay.	Defending/Explanation
because the recording situation is so different.	Defending/Explanation
but there are thirty six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty two and	Defending/Explanation
yeah you can make these mistakes.	Floor Grabber
uhhuh is u.h.h.u.h. .	Defending/Explanation
and he had like two more lines to go.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because you might have more overlap when you're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever.	Defending/Explanation
how does	Wh-Question
oh i guess i did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things.	Acknowledge-answer
but it's really part of a laugh.	Statement
we're well that's pretty pretty much it as far as meetings are concerned.	About-task
but you know they may even decide in the end to push it off.	Statement
because what we really want to do is change the scale of the likelihoods.	Defending/Explanation
by each speaker.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so are we going to masquerade the system as this as you said simple response system?	Yes-No-question
it was horrible.	Assessment/Appreciation
but but but uh hynek has.	Defending/Explanation
i don't think there'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up.	Defending/Explanation
and that's that's the best we can do.	Assessment/Appreciation
we've got individual microphones.	Negative Non-no Answers
no one told me that.	Humorous Material
but yeah definitely.	Accept
well couldn't i do let's do commercial.	Action-directive
i don't know exactly how to characterize it.	Defending/Explanation
and so that might have given the h t k use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the s r i case.	Defending/Explanation
and and most um low energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high pass kind of characteristic.	Statement
because it depends on what your purpose is.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i only did it a little bit too.	Floor Grabber
so that's that's just generally what i've been looking at.	Floor Holder
anyone else care?	Rising Tone
and that increasing past twelve seconds didn't seem to help.	Defending/Explanation
well i think one could go there's	Offer
silent partner in the in the meeting.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah actually we had this from the last time that they were here that it'd be nice to have u w do some work on language modeling that would be trying to get at the same detection as what we do acoustically.	Floor Grabber
we for a for a completely different reason i assume.	Statement
so so no.	Floor Grabber
um except for those cases it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear.	Statement
how do you feel?	Wh-Question
but not for phonemes.	Statement
could you get it so that with so it would it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker?	Rising Tone
even though we want to get a lot of data that has uh many meetings with the same people.	Defending/Explanation

that's what we talked about.	Defending/Explanation

yeah i also used i think something around zero point five seconds for the speech nonspeech detector.	Acknowledge-answer
uh where i'd i would be able to um to model um intermediate categories that span across phonemes.	Floor Holder
but text oriented.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well so we've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable.	Floor Holder
and so he sent me email and said he's going to be starting to work on it.	Statement
so is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you're looking?	Rising Tone
but most but there were only two robustness meetings and four or five uh meeting recorders.	Statement

running to	Collaborative Completion
yeah they didn't go the whole route.	Acknowledge-answer
we wouldn't have the n.l. grammar to begin with.	Defending/Explanation

what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this?	Wh-Question
what kind of normalization?	Wh-Question

okay now having said that i'm i'm impressed by how by how um well how infrequent these these kinds of extreme cases are.	Acknowledge-answer

um stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a second order i.i.r. filter.	Statement

all right we're on.	Floor Grabber
because of all these classroom	Defending/Explanation
so because the channel zero and channel one are like the same speech but only i mean the same endpoints.	Statement
so the idea is uh first of all i misspoke when i said we thought you should do the constructions.	Statement
um but i frankly didn't find it any more use to me than my hand held taperecorder.	Floor Holder
exactly so uh well you still need to be able to distinguish the different speakers.	Accept
is that the same as shorten?	Rising Tone
uh how quickly do you want it?	Wh-Question
we thought to be the case.	Statement
uh working in the cepstral domain?	Understanding Check
so that's what i thought.	Floor Grabber
not for this for sure.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
to get the answer.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is that what that	Yes-No-question
and so i'm just in in progress of yeah trying to feed the recognizer with un segmented data.	Statement

i remember transcribing one person.	Statement
very cool.	Continuer
because hari will have his own ideas too.	Defending/Explanation
um after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features.	Floor Holder
because to me it sounds more like they're trailing off.	Defending/Explanation
so i mean does one of does it mean one percent and ten percent?	Rising Tone
maybe it's a little louder than usual.	Defending/Explanation
that's f.	Mimic Other

uhhh there was this one meeting i was transcribing there were nine nine speakers.	Statement
none of them are suitable?	Declarative-Question
are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them?	Or-Question
the idea is if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something.	Statement
so i can give you a list of the short version.	Offer
so that's sort of like you know best case performance?	Understanding Check
or how easy is it for you?	Offer
do you have can you give some more details on this?	Rising Tone
it's just the mel frequency and that's it.	Statement

commercial action inside where people	Offer
yeah the ones that where they're talking about linguistic things though are great.	Floor Grabber
you know exactly what the person should have said.	Defending/Explanation
and and you know have sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what's better.	Expansions of y/n Answers

so right at the right and left of that	Statement
oh sure that's really big.	Accept
i i would just use some samples.	Offer
it was really straightforward.	Assessment/Appreciation
so if you have this band pass filter you probably get you get negative values.	Understanding Check
well that's what i was going to ask.	Rising Tone
yeah like let's come back to the original subject.	Accept
is it here?	Rising Tone
sometime it's worse.	Expansions of y/n Answers
huh .	Continuer
did they say anything on the conference call about um how the wall street journal part of the test was going to be run?	Rising Tone
then disregard it then.	Action-directive
and also we computed something called a spurt.	Statement
thirty seven fifty.	Collaborative Completion
it's all pretty related.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
like it was tough to tell.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um is is that the object type node?	Floor Grabber
i mean that would be a good question to ask.	Assessment/Appreciation
so now we are yeah setting up the software.	Negative Non-no Answers
like you might use a median.	Offer
no it's it's not stupid.	Reject
so so you see how jane's wearing it?	Declarative-Question
because we're icsi is is bottlenecked by backup.	Defending/Explanation
it feels like forever when you're doing it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
sorry i missed it.	Apology
well they might they might quote it	Maybe
um not parentheses.	Dispreferred Answers
i mean especially when they're this small.	Defending/Explanation
and and it may not have been noisy conditions.	Dispreferred Answers
it's not a mean of word error rate.	Rising Tone
i also want to tell um i also wanted to raise the issue that okay so there's this idea we're going to have this master copy of the transcript.	Rising Tone
don't have it just start.	Collaborative Completion
it seems to have about at two minute	Statement
maybe they can be little ones.	Offer
so my suggestion then is that you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the action plans are supposed to look like.	Floor Grabber
so the meeting with hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were going to freeze in this system?	Understanding Check
or noise uh frication.	Expansions of y/n Answers
got it through the l.d.c.	Statement
markus.	Acknowledge-answer
since you know what you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in you just have to segment it.	Defending/Explanation
and i think the type you say um i think dash t.	Rising Tone
so that's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data.	Statement
i have to do	Statement
i can stay.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and i i just described him well what i did.	Statement
so what i'm thinking and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this but but what i'm thinking is that in the e d u meetings they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers.	Floor Holder
oh they they had some extension that they announced or something?	Understanding Check
or just something.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i but but	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
speaking of taking control you said you had some research to talk about.	About-task
oh well yeah that's that's a different thing.	Acknowledge-answer
oh it's not a problem not a problem yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
it's just what should we get just more sony ones?	Yes-No-question
other action items.	About-task
so so one of our	Floor Grabber
is it a whatever?	Rising Tone
yeah but that but the good thing about it is it is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right categories are.	Understanding Check
not not so much in this meeting about aurora.	Statement
in other words rather than um uh saying we're going to listen to everything	Offer
and that is if we go ahead and we just run his and we generate the beeps file then we have somebody listen beeps file.	Offer
we could do some digits.	Offer
because it's actually you know it's it's how to it's what can i what application can i have for a for a uh a class method rather or a class you know a class procedure.	Statement
well but you know but you could get again.	Offer
um i told you i was i was i was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam.	Floor Holder

just uh things that that we've been chatting about.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um as as a starting point for the project.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean any all of the mikes have the d c removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it.	Defending/Explanation
they they may or may not provide speaker i.d.	Maybe
i don't even know how to pronounce that.	Other Answers
so i mean does this capture like where do you put	Yes-No-question
well there's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
on the r.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because you're you're you're visual uh abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out	Defending/Explanation
we'll know we'll know to come after.	Humorous Material
because then you have silence portion that have some spectra similar to the the overall speech spectra.	Defending/Explanation
the m s g problem.	Rising Tone
it's linearized.	Statement
you seem very upset about it.	Statement
you're talking about writing h.t.m.l. right?	Understanding Check
online two is good.	Assessment/Appreciation
and i plotted this for two channels.	Statement
uh quarter to four.	Statement
so one of one of the things that i tried like i said was to remove those zeros in the filter by doing some smoothing of the filter.	Statement
i mean there isn't one.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah in that in that sense.	Accept
and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency.	Statement
but this is the the technology it's actually a little bit thinner than this.	Statement
for example discriminating between phones.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but it it's really helpful to go through it a a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context.	Statement
right yeah they could say it different ways.	Acknowledge-answer
and if you don't include that in the model it doesn't work very well.	Statement
yeah well that's not so much spectral subtraction then.	Acknowledge-answer
if i use a channel zero vad to estimate the noise.	Rising Tone
yeah i see what you mean.	Statement
that will just be a copy of the one above it except for different models from training.	Understanding Check
um yeah the other thing is that you saw that that mail about uh the v a d v a d's performing quite differently.	Floor Holder
didn't they have something at cape?	Rising Tone
now if you have signal and you have noise you basically have these two bumps in the histogram.	Statement
but it's a nice it's i recommend his his his graphic.	Offer
so we should be adding the breaks if	Understanding Check
so this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff.	Statement
is your silence category pure silence or	Or-Question
and um so what will you parse out of that sentence?	Rhetorical-Question
maybe remind us.	Offer
as it really switches around between two different channels i think.	Defending/Explanation
what what do you uh what do you guys see as as being what you would be doing in the next week given what's happened?	Wh-Question

not not entirely modify it.	Downplayer
even if it's a poor system in some ways.	Expansions of y/n Answers
especially with regard to the aurora stuff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so you're sort of trying them all.	Understanding Check
i mean it seems like that's much more reliable.	Defending/Explanation
if it sounds like a yawn	Statement
so you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise.	Offer
are are you saying l.d. a?	Yes-No-question
um i think brian is on vacation now.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so i have a couple of minor ones.	Statement
so this training meeting uh is that uh some data where we have uh very um you know accurate time marks for	Yes-No-question

it's hard when people get really really like into their laughing and start talking at the same time.	Assessment/Appreciation

with respect to the use of delta.	Statement

what am i thinking of?	Wh-Question
did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for for uh t. v?	Rising Tone

so the next possibility is that um we've given just a single weight to each expert.	Statement

really hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
and if it does influence anything then you're going to need something that converts from the the number here to something that's relevant to the decision there.	Offer
so sometimes people will say because in the meeting.	Defending/Explanation
i mean we could uh just sit here and listen to it all.	Statement
and certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in.	Offer
i mean just for transcribing it you mean.	Understanding Check

well what i was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing if it's far field stuff.	Offer
which uh the the frames speech frames which are which are missed.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so it would have to go on a p c somewhere.	Defending/Explanation
i mean it's an infinite number of channels.	Expansions of y/n Answers
let's see um	Self-talk
so this a notion of a source path goal trajector possibly obstacles.	Statement
uh but uh uh this is actually a conversation you and i have to have about your thesis fantasies and how all this fits into that.	Statement
i think we have to start cutting down.	Offer
would you would	Yes-No-question
and and people have different major topics that they're interested in.	Defending/Explanation
i mean this is just a question.	Downplayer
so dave hasn't tried that yet?	Understanding Check
we could simply say that is uh done on the uh server.	Statement
oh good point yes.	Assessment/Appreciation
you didn't	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah then we're completely gone.	Statement
yeah there's a there's a they really need it in novosibirsk.	Humorous Material
yeah we're we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly.	Floor Grabber
get a bunch of histograms.	Offer
just as a suggestion maybe you could save as to keep your old one nice and clean.	Offer
what what were some of the points again about that?	Rising Tone
because like that's what i can hear.	Defending/Explanation
sample it rather.	Misspeak Self-Correction
sorry uh i'm not sure what dan's page is that you mean he was looking at the two	Apology
whichever they are.	Misspeak Self-Correction
it's um it computes features which are um based on sort of like based on different um wavelet basis functions used to analyze the input.	Statement
all right go ahead.	Acknowledge-answer
can't we downsample?	Rising Tone
uh but i think that isn't what you mean.	Floor Holder
so we just tried directly to to just keep the system as it was.	Rising Tone
i guess he's busy with	Collaborative Completion
since that's the most obvious thing when you listen to it.	Defending/Explanation
it doesn't make that much difference i think.	Dispreferred Answers
we could do it this way.	Assessment/Appreciation
and that might account for some of the discrepancies in the results.	Statement
yeah a laptop.	Floor Grabber
yeah there was something weird about that.	Floor Grabber
or will it operate on the original?	Or-Clause
uh you know i mean what should we do in terms of tea?	Wh-Question
do you want to stop for a meal or pick up food or something?	Yes-No-question
but it seems like we it doesn't it seems like it's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate the phrase marks and the speaker and speaker identity without putting in the words.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah well the um the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot.	Floor Grabber
yes good.	Acknowledge-answer
yep there's all there's all sorts of uh deviations from the ideal here.	Acknowledge-answer
oh this is for the v a d?	Acknowledge-answer
do you want to	Yes-No-question
has not.	Acknowledge-answer
but we could say uh where did you live before you were five.	Offer
yeah you know you're supposed to you're a budget meeting or something.	Floor Holder
who how far is the uh the the m three l specification for for the natural language input gone on the the uh	Wh-Question
maybe if when we have the new the new neural network trained with p l p delta and delta delta	Offer
okay so first decision is we're going to anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned.	Action-directive
so uhhuh uhhuh huh.	Statement
um but what happens also is that if i listen to the um a re synthesized version of the speech	Floor Holder
it's not a great example.	Assessment/Appreciation
with my backchannel?	Understanding Check
because you know we're sort of doing the corpus.	Defending/Explanation
not easy.	Assessment/Appreciation
and part of it will be well this combination of close talking and uh and uh environmental mikes.	Defending/Explanation
it creates a shadow.	Defending/Explanation
well i'd leave all the all the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up.	Accept-part
i'm not sure what i mean what's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other.	Defending/Explanation
so maybe you probably need to back up a bit.	Offer
i did collect an agenda.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well see uh also this has been a a change in the procedure that used to be that they were like uh one long string.	Defending/Explanation
voice environments for programmers.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so you've you guys have looked at this?	Declarative-Question
which will try to give us back an answer from the speech only as to whether the person's frustrated or not.	Statement
pretty well.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i also wonder if if it's partly that spanish has different pronunciations in different regions.	Rising Tone
well maybe i shouldn't say that on record.	Statement
it's been studied a lot.	Statement
yeah this is great.	Accept
it did very well.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
right well that's why i saying.	Floor Grabber
and we start like branching off into the into the our layer of uh transcripts.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean it's not bad.	Assessment/Appreciation
but it would be something uh but everything would be an agent.	Statement
is that person more likely to want to walk there?	Yes-No-question
that brings up	Statement
i think you should collect both simultaneously.	Offer
and segment on the fly.	Collaborative Completion
and and um you know in some sense we're all doing fairly similar things.	Floor Holder
actually the longer the robustness meetings take longer.	Statement
but in the	Statement
take a taxi.	Statement
but we didn't record.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so we looked at the distribution of these different kinds of tags overall.	Statement
for the adaptation?	Understanding Check
what is audio pixelization?	Wh-Question
because i can catch a lot of things.	Defending/Explanation
uh we're already having problems with these delay uh delay issues.	Floor Holder
i mean this this may not help us uh in the evaluation.	Downplayer
i i don't i didn't remember.	Other Answers
it seems like because if i was just reading that thing i would say so that would be a problem so.	Statement
sunil hasn't hasn't heard about uh what i've been doing.	Defending/Explanation
and filter them with the v a d.	Statement
i haven't listened to it.	Defending/Explanation
not for not for c.m.u.	Dispreferred Answers
what would the percentage be then?	Rhetorical-Question
and that's when you'd start doing things.	Understanding Check
right so somehow the	Floor Grabber
what i mean is i mean when somebody says uhhuh in the middle of uh a	Defending/Explanation
so you could fire off a thousand of those.	Expansions of y/n Answers
all of these do have this kind of tour um aspect about the way you would go to them.	Statement
yeah but i don't know which v a d they use.	Other Answers
well it gives something different.	Dispreferred Answers
okay so also um	Floor Grabber
and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of.	Statement
but also trying to huh uh trying to find the de-convolution filter.	Rising Tone
but the recognition quality is going to be horrendous.	Negative Non-no Answers
but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries right?	Understanding Check
or or is yours hidden in that?	Or-Clause
and i'll try to get one for you too.	Commit
well if not if you want to burn the c ds you're welcome to it.	Statement
so they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying you first did?	Understanding Check
well if an unblacked out channel is zero is actually spitting out zeros you can be pretty sure it's off.	Statement
what was the what was the laptop sound?	Wh-Question
skateboards.	Expansions of y/n Answers
basmati?	Collaborative Completion
yeah except we didn't record.	Statement
so the channels	Statement
for for all of the digit models they end up at three mixtures per state.	Rising Tone
and if they say i don't want to give it say okay.	Action-directive
well like	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and i can give you those to to process.	Statement
the poor transcribers.	Assessment/Appreciation
but it can't be yeah very deep.	Accept-part
i can write down some of these	3rd-party-talk
they were going to	Statement
one two or more.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and i guess it depends of what kind of audience you're talking to.	Downplayer
how about if you just go uh?	Wh-Question
um when i was sitting here and we were doing	Statement
there's it's an or at the output isn't it?	Understanding Check
for the t i digits they want to train on clean and on noisy.	Rising Tone
so it improves over not having the wiener filter.	Dispreferred Answers
prone.	Humorous Material
sax yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
and um if they haven't decided things like this like what the parameters are going to be for this uh when deciding is not just somebody deciding i mean in fact there should be some understanding behind the uh deciding which means some experiments and and so forth it it it seems pretty tight to me.	Floor Holder
and then uh weren't issues of of having a a second stream or something?	Rising Tone
but it shows specifically this to this task that it's very constructive.	Statement
so so you need to discuss with him what we're doing.	Action-directive
so you you so you had a	Statement
beep ify!	Exclamation
well i've been reading some literature about clustering of data.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um but obviously there are lots of other things.	Downplayer
like one percent relative compared to the v.a.d. based estimates.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and fifty one point three.	Rising Tone
so that's in our uh in in johno's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter view or approach something.	Understanding Check
we don't understand anything in this meeting.	Humorous Material
what about the um your trip yesterday?	Rising Tone
or are they glosses?	Or-Clause
so that thing the little that part should be pointing upwards.	Statement
it's just in the wrong place.	Collaborative Completion
well that's lovely.	Assessment/Appreciation
um the output is used as uh features as well.	Floor Holder
of course that didn't take too long at that point.	Understanding Check
sure okay.	Acknowledge-answer
well you just did.	Negative Non-no Answers
because you said separate forms so i thought maybe	Defending/Explanation
and so exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things.	Floor Holder
is that a dash or a dot in there?	Understanding Check
and there is also a noise addition after uh cleaning up the mel bins.	Statement
i'm wondering	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
a few.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
where's the little things that's supposed to say transcript l dash blah blah blah?	Wh-Question
so i've um downloaded uh a couple of things from mississippi state.	Statement
yeah i also would like to argue for that.	Floor Grabber
but that's not the corpus that we're collecting.	Statement
but if we're rather than rather than designing our own format we'll just take whatever comes out of the tools that we can find to use i think.	Offer
and so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just mail them to us and we'll sneak them into the collection.	Action-directive
or does it mean five percent and fifty percent?	Rising Tone
but i wanted to think carefully about who's generating it.	Defending/Explanation
might be interesting to look at it.	Offer
and that's what's slow.	Defending/Explanation
uh the second thing is the this spectral subtraction.	Rising Tone
french french uh phoneme strings were corrected manually.	Statement
so that later we can do other things with it.	Statement
so they have looks like they have	Statement
and this is the results are on the other document.	Rising Tone
time.	Statement
speakers and	Collaborative Completion
because the well matched is still weighted more than.	Defending/Explanation
and and what is that?	Rising Tone
like in	Statement
why why is that?	Wh-Question
okay leave the mikes on.	Acknowledge-answer
let's just take one example.	Statement
what's what's that?	Wh-Question
i mean for instance you're you're talking about the signal and noise um at a particular point.	Defending/Explanation
or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff?	Rising Tone
yeah they're referring to this or that and the other thing.	Statement
maybe may	Maybe
yeah and um it might actually	Floor Grabber
so so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here and then there's some background speech may be overlapping it somehow.	Statement
and we send it to i b m.	Offer
but i mean this is something one would try to infer.	Rising Tone
but but you want to have that information.	Statement
yeah i if it's wizard of oz i think it will be.	Defending/Explanation
oh in german.	Acknowledge-answer
six hour test set.	Mimic Other
right except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues um that you can use to do that.	Accept
this this smoothing is done on the estimate um of what you're going to subtract or on the thing that has already had something subtracted?	Understanding Check
though it is not.	Statement
so but for the other meetings it's the downsampled version that you have.	Understanding Check
okay so we're talking about discovering intermediate categories to um to classify.	Floor Holder
for it to be forgotten.	Expansions of y/n Answers
just not as much as he would like.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what why?	Rising Tone
sort of one branch is to get us caught up on what's going on.	Statement
jane do you want to pick a few?	Action-directive
because there's so many voices in my head.	Defending/Explanation
it seems to be helping on the well matched condition.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i think she's got a nice voice.	Acknowledge-answer
i mean i suspect my normal	Statement
and sometimes they don't.	Reject-part
but uh um because our best improvements over the years that we've gotten from finding bugs.	Floor Holder
i mean it's kind of amazing too that you know the transcription tool we just converged on the same	Assessment/Appreciation
and um dan ellis it was when dan ellis was still here.	Statement
it's true it would disturb the um the the long range.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans.	Floor Holder
um because	Floor Holder
oh how great.	Assessment/Appreciation
maybe higher order cumulants.	Maybe
peanuts.	Collaborative Completion
most of but most of those people don't rely on the self evaluations anyway.	Defending/Explanation
printed it out.	3rd-party-talk
do you have to speak true english sentences when you do this?	Humorous Material
isn't there a save as inside of java base?	Understanding Check
right as though it's leading into something else.	Floor Grabber
but just not for the task we intended.	Defending/Explanation
well but see i find it interesting even if it wasn't any more.	Floor Grabber
so you could actually produce like code?	Declarative-Question
actually i guess.	Self-talk
because in two party conversations like switchboard there's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels if you consider those overlaps.	Rising Tone
we we talked about this before.	Statement
all right let's try three at once you you pick one in the middle.	Floor Grabber
oh that's really interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
what so what are you so you've done some portion of the first meeting.	Understanding Check
uh where they're all distant.	Floor Holder
at what stage do you do that?	Wh-Question
and that they should be able to handle themselves.	Statement
oh i didn't understand.	Acknowledge-answer
uh yeah we we don't have a mike that uh is particular to a person.	Floor Holder
yeah by filtering or something?	Floor Grabber
i'm glad to hear it glad to hear it.	Assessment/Appreciation
um how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data uh if it's going to be different from old data that you have?	Floor Holder
like one time everybody was doing the um digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we'll probably hit horrible traffic.	Downplayer
they have to have targets.	Statement
it's abbott so it just but it's it's a lot of data.	Statement
it's pretty big.	Assessment/Appreciation
no i don't agree necessarily.	Reject
um looking for uh whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places.	Floor Holder
no no we would use the same segmentations.	Reject
the p.d. a?	Understanding Check
yeah in general.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah i i think.	Accept
and uh so we need word transcripts and uh speaker change identification.	Floor Holder
so when we look at this error rate	Rising Tone
that's the first order but thing.	Rising Tone
well i could at least	Statement
i'm on channel three.	Statement
is that the line spectral	Yes-No-question
the ones that are finished being transcribed as opposed to in the process of being transcribed	Statement
and then you go up to this next level.	Expansions of y/n Answers
instead of leaving it negative you don't do it.	Understanding Check
but uh my spot checking has made me think that we do have uh in also um american data represented here.	Statement
well i'm going to be out next week.	Statement
oh there is something spelled out b.e.e.e.e.e.e.p.	Floor Grabber
but i i	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so so i one question.	Floor Grabber
the microphones are different?	Declarative-Question
and uh do you want to do the p.d.a.'s and the p.z.m.'s?	Offer
yeah perhaps we could.	Accept
and um relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is is pretty	Floor Holder
we can for september we can set up a work schedule and we can maybe work independently.	Offer
so why would one use that rather than p. make?	Wh-Question
it's not that big actually.	Dispreferred Answers
okay that would make a difference.	Acknowledge-answer
know know know where we're going?	Declarative-Question
yeah and and purely finite state transducers are not so good for german since there's um	Floor Grabber
we could have like business to business e. commerce as well.	Offer
why don't you go ahead barry?	Offer
well i know that i know that um the mississippi state tools at least what the produce does not come out in s t m format.	Statement
mark's aware of those too.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah that's what it seems like.	Floor Grabber
i think that would be lovely.	Assessment/Appreciation
i don't remember off hand.	Other Answers
yeah but we uh you you're right it might not be enough.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
that would get expressed and then hopefully you know you'd get an answer back.	Statement
so our current v a d is is more than twenty percent.	Statement
we'll give them all the the multi channel stuff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you have models of short males?	Understanding Check
but uh what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold overall but you compare it to the energy in the other microphones?	Offer
yeah like when they do random sounds that you have no idea	Acknowledge-answer
so i think for both of the reasons it's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a in a word like way.	Offer
you know if if we were to add in addition and i'm offering this um to the word level also the uh so stressed words within utterances.	Offer
it's total crap.	Acknowledge-answer
um the action planner guy has wrote has written a a lengthy proposal on how he wants to do the action planning.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
well that's the that was my my status report.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
they were trying to do something different like taking uh well using filter that takes only a past.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah so we want to do the same same thing.	Accept
no steep inclinations?	Declarative-Question
take the	Offer
yep or like i'll think	Accept
have shorter meetings!	Offer
well i am still working with uh v t s.	Rising Tone
oh this is right it says right above here channel channel error resilience.	Acknowledge-answer
what if there was a door slam or something?	Wh-Question
well you can intone it however you want.	Action-directive
except of course they they agreed.	Defending/Explanation
something that identifies the speaker.	Statement
so what are you doing?	Rising Tone
that's so cool.	Assessment/Appreciation
no well according to the transcripts.	Reject
does france telecom do this?	Rising Tone
when i was listening to the original file that adam had it's like you you hear a word then you hear a beep and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence.	Expansions of y/n Answers
to test whether um there's the existence of sonorance in a sub band.	Expansions of y/n Answers
downsample.	Mimic Other
yeah worry about it when we get back in.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um is it like a gaussian mixture model?	Yes-No-question
um one of the ideas that we had come up with last week for things to try to improve the system	Floor Grabber
i don't use it anymore.	Dispreferred Answers
it took time.	Repeat
no i'm i'm totally serious to have one word like beep.	Reject
because you're averaging the stationary and the non stationary and finally you end up getting something.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i guess that's true.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because what we had before for for uh speaker change detection did not include these overlaps.	Defending/Explanation
no i i mean ninety	Reject
and the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things.	Statement
so the update of that is going to have to be essentially external to the belief net.	Statement
so what we need is something that's the reverse that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it.	Offer
uh and and and particularly at the interruption points.	Statement
but but it but forty four and sixteen are not easy.	Dispreferred Answers
that's just a quick update about what we've got.	Statement
and we go to ninety four point o four.	Statement
it makes a lot of sense.	Statement
but sometimes it can be too large also if if the noise uh energy in this particular frequency band drops for some reason.	Statement
but it will tend to have this high frequency component.	Statement
yeah they are.	Dispreferred Answers
add what liz?	Wh-Question
you're a very soft whistler.	3rd-party-talk
no it's more a matter of uh proficiency.	Reject
what are their inputs?	Wh-Question
everywhere.	Statement
it does this sometimes.	Statement
but if if he's not that's great too.	Statement
right and you can give an example.	Accept
yeah just just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on h t k.	Action-directive
so like if i'm asking you a question you may start answering before i'm even done.	Expansions of y/n Answers
again?	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean maybe maybe you can do it layers or something.	Offer
especially when describing like the set up in this room also and the different types of mikes.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but if uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so if what you're doing is improving the signal to noise ratio then it would be better.	Expansions of y/n Answers
anant?	Understanding Check
and so it it was saying uh	Statement
but it's been a while.	Statement
because i would get the whole i'd get the whole transcript of the meeting.	Defending/Explanation
sometimes the beginning the person started to say something.	Statement
lea?	Declarative-Question
parallel.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech and whatever we try it on with proposal one.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i yeah.	Accept
so substitute l.s. for whatever command you want to run.	Reformulate/Summarize
so we will try also to add a nice downsampling.	Commit
just wanted to know.	Statement
um do um	Floor Grabber
yeah but that has a variable latency.	Acknowledge-answer
but i mean the the the the normal thing for c one would be to to uh get rid of the mean and and the variance.	Offer
so maybe i mean depending on where she is like maybe	Statement
so stretch out that visit for that.	Action-directive
yeah it's difficult.	Assessment/Appreciation
yes they have.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
on the multi condition in t i digits yeah.	Collaborative Completion
not infinite.	Downplayer
because of timit results.	Defending/Explanation
no we always have the original long ones.	Accept
oh yeah the element.	Acknowledge-answer
so i mean a person is asked a whole bunch of questions more than you'd usually think they'd be asked.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um one thing is that	Floor Holder
yeah but i mean in this case for the eighty seven point one we used m l p outputs for the p l p net.	Floor Grabber
the the it's a good suggestion.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah the though i think uh there was one problem with that in that you know we used canonical mapping.	Floor Grabber
was it noisy condition?	Rising Tone
yeah they do write the numbers in.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
forced alignment on the sub band labels.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i must say that this one looks a bit strange to me.	Statement
yes they do.	Accept
boundary.	Repeat
no it's in parallel.	Dispreferred Answers
and there's interest up there?	Declarative-Question
yeah sure sure.	Accept
so we have the data just not the recognizer.	Floor Grabber
and this person starts to talk.	Expansions of y/n Answers
better than what it can do i mean.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so the mismatched condition.	Statement
i don't know where the rest of it came from.	Other Answers
i had that same reaction.	Statement
well they've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff.	Statement
user thrift.	Collaborative Completion
i think i think pass is socially acceptable.	Statement
or just uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
it's plenty bad.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use?	Or-Question
roll call.	Mimic Other
maybe you know why why throw it away if you don't need to?	Rhetorical-Question
yeah i mean he was never like	Floor Grabber
okay to me that's takes longer than to do it with the mouse.	Acknowledge-answer
is there a way that we can add keywords or	Yes-No-question
yeah i built a few built a few houses.	Accept
you mean like see see meter readings from while sitting here?	Understanding Check
but it was such a bad baseline that i don't know what that means.	Statement
well steady state.	Self-talk
um i i agree that that would be an interesting thing to do.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
maybe the final result must be better.	Offer
we talked about that we're getting the recording equipment running at u.w.	Statement
and the while you're debugging you will just	Statement
really inexpensive.	Expansions of y/n Answers
almost identical in fact.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you can do both.	Statement
we just take the beginning of the utterance.	Offer
yeah it's coincidence that it's very fortunate because	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
or maybe six?	Understanding Check
except i think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle.	Understanding Check
and for me the lapel was okay.	Statement
because you'd get some number that would be skewed by be skewed by that	Defending/Explanation
so do i have a tigerfish one right now?	Understanding Check
and what's your plan?	Wh-Question
you won't be able to align.	Defending/Explanation
but actually i mean just to first order suppose you just didn't do anything smart at all.	Offer
well all these languages.	Statement
once you know the segmentations uh who you're going to which speakers will get left out even before you run your processing.	Understanding Check
you've also gone through	Statement
uh suppose you don't use any of those things.	Floor Holder
we're so this second that you're saying now is system wide second?	Understanding Check
and here's sort of what they started talking about.	Defending/Explanation
removing all these k l t's and putting one single k l t at the end.	Offer
so we don't	Statement
just to check.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i tried to do it with the numbers.	Statement
because that's that that varies temporally.	Defending/Explanation
no the undead meeting.	Humorous Material
only multi english.	Expansions of y/n Answers
since they can ramp up much quicker in the language modeling.	Defending/Explanation
so maybe that's what you meant.	Statement
so one was the ontology.	Rising Tone
yeah we get the same performance.	Accept
but some variant of wiener filtering.	Defending/Explanation
um there's a little program that downloads into it.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
i do that too!	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean if you were interested in it then we could do it for instance.	Statement
but that's very similar to sonorance.	Statement
but it's going to be horrible.	Statement
and and be sure and say would you like fries with that when you're thinking about your pay scale.	Humorous Material
um i i did before we do the digits i did also want to remind people uh please do send me you know uh thoughts for an agenda.	Floor Holder
but anyway so um if you if you can think of a way to uh point us to to interesting things sort of as you're doing this or or something.	Offer
was there some suggestion that they might soon or	Or-Question
yeah but actually the well well the well matched	Floor Grabber
um i kind of see like after after building the primary detectors i see um myself taking the outputs and feeding them in sort of tandem style into into a um gaussian mixtures h.m.m. back end um and doing recognition.	Floor Holder
twenty.	Statement
not where you live.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah look at a	Accept
uh with	Expansions of y/n Answers
huh wow.	Assessment/Appreciation
so we're going to read some more digit strings i guess?	Declarative-Question
so um i guess we got lots to catch up on.	Floor Grabber
um they weren't impossible.	Floor Holder
which means it's more stretched out right?	Understanding Check
well is	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
okay uh okay.	Acknowledge-answer
right but we can do automated alignment.	Accept
all right now i'm just slightly impressed.	Acknowledge-answer
no no no no no no.	Reject
but and then but um arguably what we should do is even though the software can do many things we should for now pick a set of things.	Offer
they they have several options.	Statement
to re train?	Understanding Check
and um we we got an improvement uh in word error rate training on the t i digits data set and testing on meeting recorder digits of um six percent to four point five percent.	Floor Holder
yeah i'm just saying that's like the opposite.	Defending/Explanation
or just put it on videotape?	Or-Clause
dine out is	Wh-Question
but continuous features.	Offer
is that going to be a better solution than just going out and buy one?	Rising Tone
okay i think that's good that's that's pretty much all i can think of.	Floor Grabber
okay go ahead jane.	Action-directive
so um as you know the meeting today is to um benefit from your involvement in the data.	Floor Holder
you know would uh among your peers.	Offer
and other sorts of uh acoustic problems.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no it doesn't to me either.	Accept
how much of this do you need?	Wh-Question
but um we we did a first try with this.	Floor Holder
oh you mean like uh like like um meeting recorder as opposed to e.d.u. as	Acknowledge-answer
i mean on on the temple's the pressure?	Understanding Check
and then i look for the minima.	Floor Holder
so they are helping.	Statement
uh yeah you could write write them write something on the board.	Offer
or you could have go there be binary and given that you're going there when.	Offer
to use those segmentations.	Offer
outrageous!	Exclamation
but if if there was a way to merge the two	Offer
oh i think i think it'd be easy to to say background laptop.	Offer
what would you like it to do when that happens?	Wh-Question
yeah i mean it's it's actually uh very similar.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh you know it's like uh psychological approach also that you like to have some standard stimulus here.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the contextual k l t.	Statement
i mean i will take pictures of them.	Defending/Explanation
it's uh yeah it doesn't matter.	Downplayer
so can we get	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
because you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone um depending on the timing of the echo.	Defending/Explanation
i certainly could though.	Statement
that kind of thing is good.	Assessment/Appreciation
march o one?	Declarative-Question
so that's fine.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh from the belief net point of view it is.	Accept-part
um we could also sort of have the analogen of our sample sentences.	Statement
yeah it was a small difference.	Statement
or you know?	Follow Me
well we're not really set up for it to do that.	Negative Non-no Answers
that's why i'm saying.	Statement
uh so the third and the fifth line of the table	Rising Tone
yeah but that's my question.	Acknowledge-answer
in the s r i recognizer.	Expansions of y/n Answers
just as a way of organizing the discussion.	Defending/Explanation
that's fascinating.	Assessment/Appreciation
of course frame frames have a lot of variance to them.	Statement
so then she can decide oh we don't need all this stuff.	Statement
what they uh what they decided.	Expansions of y/n Answers
x one matters more than x two or	Collaborative Completion
but it is not all of the multi english.	Understanding Check
but something having to do with the voice activity detector.	Statement
um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately work on?	Floor Holder
you you plan to to train actually models based on this data.	Understanding Check
so we we we want to go and check that in for anything that we're going to use the p d a mike for.	Statement
computers and speech recognition.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is it a bank?	Expansions of y/n Answers
well just in in each case take a take a take a frame.	Offer
you have your mastery of english and these various things.	Statement

i'll tell them about the free lunch.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
boy it's hard to uh that ignore that word!	Assessment/Appreciation
hnh.	Continuer
i like saying it.	Defending/Explanation

so i'll let	Action-directive
what it is.	Expansions of y/n Answers
how did	Wh-Question
oh that's interesting!	Acknowledge-answer
and apparently that's happened in the past.	Defending/Explanation
but we can blend it for the public.	Offer
do you know about the stuttgart um people?	Rising Tone
release to begin with.	Collaborative Completion
oh i'm sure they do.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah that's it fits into a hearer's range of perception um better than a lot of female voices.	Accept
anything starting with x. is scratch.	Defending/Explanation
that that uh andreas has been playing with.	Expansions of y/n Answers
anybody else want to work on this by the way horacio?	Humorous Material
and so we'll have a single place where the stuff is.	Understanding Check
like i don't mean to.	Expansions of y/n Answers
do you want to read digits?	Rising Tone
because you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech for that.	Defending/Explanation
well uh that to me that's a whole nother that's a whole nother issue.	Floor Grabber
well and they've thought about things.	Statement
and you had to mark interruptions by a slash.	Understanding Check
do it that way.	Statement
they have to yeah they have to insure that that's a real spurt or something.	Rising Tone
and he said he said i wasn't talking to you.	Statement
if you do all these in word error rates it's a lot easier right?	Repeat
so you have the um comic uh where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't want to say that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah that i mean he's he's removing the old thing.	Floor Grabber
it was the day i left.	Statement
well the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the spectral subtracted noise portion is is larger.	Statement
this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels.	Statement
um i mean i have a so small uh hacked up system which sort of for for the broadcast news determines the approximate number of speakers and actually assigns some names to them.	Floor Holder
point it's supposed to be point six.	Understanding Check
but the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and and sort of back generate the queries.	Dispreferred Answers
well i mean it's	Statement
i think we have to think about how i think that this can't be decided today.	Statement
in a first step i mean.	Statement
like noise modulated with well with amplitude modulations.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think that's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately and have them available.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because i have a feeling that when we look when we look at the just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it's voiced and unvoiced.	Rising Tone
it was it was the beginning of a meeting.	Defending/Explanation
declination yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and so i again if you take a few of these things that are are um promising features and look at them in pairs uh i think you'll have much more of a sense of okay i now have uh doing a bunch of these analyses.	Offer
this is not perhaps not clear here.	Reject
okay if you think it won't slow you down at all.	Acknowledge-answer
uh well don's been working hard.	Statement
yeah i have each of these each of the end belief nets be be a page and then you click on the thing.	Accept
it's you know his optional is not really boldface but	Defending/Explanation
i'm glad.	Acknowledge-answer
so for each one	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's similar in the smoothing.	Collaborative Completion
but it seems to be the sort of thing that this would be good for.	Floor Holder
it has all these mikes and it has a plug in jack to the p d a.	Offer
the other thing is is it just a few people who don't like them in the e d u group?	Rising Tone
there's there's at least two or three that i can think of that to me are very different.	Rising Tone
but like it could be someone who isn't the person here but the person over there or it can be the person breathing.	Statement
yeah okay i know who you're talking about.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah now	Floor Grabber
so how does the summary get generated?	Wh-Question
or even asian.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like i have an l.d.a.l.d.a. plus online normalization.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the the acoustics of this room.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right are they just for time alignment or are they for transcription as well?	Floor Grabber
discourse aspect.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i think the anonymization if if you want to proceed with that now i just think that that's that's a discussion which also really deserves a a you know more that just a minute.	Offer
so then you you listen to it a second time and move it over to here.	Statement
online normalization and l.d. a?	Understanding Check
it's sixty kilohertz is plenty.	Assessment/Appreciation
so you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets?	Wh-Question
r d r d r.	Statement
then so question mark colon is fine for that.	Offer
have you run across these mock fights?	Yes-No-question
and in terms of transcription it would be easy to do it that way.	Offer
i wanted to ask one question about the the nature of the design.	Topic Change
so we'll throw it out.	Statement
is that how they do it?	Rising Tone
and what's what's the plan about that?	Wh-Question
ground truth as they call it is very clear.	Statement
i mean we went through and with the schedules and we	Statement
um and i will email these notes.	Floor Holder
well on the one hand uh it's not a full identity.	Floor Holder
um suppose we said okay we've got these different features and so forth.	Statement
in those i trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds or four seconds or six seconds.	Statement
and certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred that would be hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
well you see that's possible too.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well we may just have to do it when it gets back here.	Offer
yeah .sure.	Accept
i mean if if you have only a noisy signal at a level which you you try to estimate the noise from the assuming that the first few frames are noise.	Statement
and what's always funny to me is when it's you know they miss the gender completely.	Statement
but not if it costs more.	Accept-part
is the p. p.t.a. working.	Expansions of y/n Answers
where chuck is saying a few things inside.	Expansions of y/n Answers
okay so you have the castle of heidelberg.	Follow Me
then it'd be fine.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean i don't know how how reliable lea is.	Other Answers
and i'd run some some sort of tandem style processing with uh my intermediate classifiers.	Commit
i do too.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so you know we have a couple weeks.	Statement
you gave me those dozens of files.	Statement
because the baseline word error rate was around forty percent on digits.	Statement
and then they throw in an uh.	Statement
i think that's natural and lovely.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah that's what i tend to do is i use a soundwave.	Floor Grabber
is this with the new v.a. d?	Rising Tone
i asked if somebody else wanted the lapel mike.	Statement
because that's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation.	Defending/Explanation
um but um um	Floor Holder
uh you say you would say like um.	Floor Holder
uh it doesn't seem to hurt on t.i. digits finally.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you know and each person is only going to do it once.	Statement
ask them their opinion.	Offer
yeah uhhuh maybe.	Accept
hub five.	Repeat
uh what's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but i think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that they would probably use it as a first pass or something.	Defending/Explanation
anyway so my idea for today	About-task
and and really see what you can do with a real system.	Defending/Explanation
no this is not the release form.	Statement
icsi.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but if you look at the the numbers um you clearly see that the difference between the c zero of the speech and c zero of the noise portion is larger.	Statement
i object to that characterization!	Exclamation
but there's some of that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i mean yeah one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets.	Statement
i mean it will be somewhere you know.	Defending/Explanation
but it's but i think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time.	Offer
you know it's like you got your	Statement
uh uh as long as you have the spectral subtraction.	Expansions of y/n Answers
this is in the mel frequency bands.	Defending/Explanation
clearly.	Accept
so while he's vacationing um we've been uh	Statement
uh but uh uh in my opinion we need uh uh a reference uh session to to to evaluate the the the tool.	Statement
so we can see what should be combined.	Defending/Explanation
normally a note taker would know not to do that.	Statement
but it could sit anywhere in the attention recognition.	Statement
they just kept getting repeated often and often.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i think you know that our goal should be by next week when hynek comes back uh to uh really just to have a firm path uh for the you know for the time he's gone.	Offer
no to the pronunciation model.	Reject
in fact their array their array will be	Statement
so three on this side.	Rising Tone
if instead of instead of instead of professor or instead of post doc?	Understanding Check
uh actually the way things seems to	Statement
i i don't recognize a lot of these.	Other Answers
and marcus and michael together are um leading the discussion there.	Statement
if you guys had run into problems.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and and what i mean in in what we were doing which was not so much looking at things it was okay.	Statement
that's actually why i called this meeting.	Statement
to do all my work.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or room adapted.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's our system.	Dispreferred Answers
because it's it's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface.	Defending/Explanation
why would that be um considering that we actually got an improvement in near mike performance using h t k?	Defending/Explanation
no it's it's not the same.	Reject
um i think i think it's not going to i think that's not going to be good enough.	Floor Holder
yeah um i think that's right.	Accept
and it's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it.	Floor Holder
but you'll only know that in the voiced regions.	Defending/Explanation
whereas this is a	Statement
oh yeah um something um maybe i just don't know how to do this.	Accept
but not much of improvement.	Statement
so they splitting up between the t i digits and everything else i see.	Statement
it's mine!	Exclamation
you know because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn.	Defending/Explanation
which i think is unlikely.	Defending/Explanation
it was just a net search.	Defending/Explanation
what the	Signal-non-understanding
uh it gets rid of the speech.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but we really should move into the you know data that reflects as much as possible the real scenario.	Offer
and so if someone wants to do that that's fine.	Statement
but i have here	Statement
looks good.	Assessment/Appreciation
um how well do they do over a range of these different tests not just the italian?	Open-Question
i mean sure if we can get more from them fine.	Statement
so that's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically.	Statement
you basically once the um the top the top one's done you could easily re run the whole set of experiments.	Offer
so i i asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i'm like it's just laughing.	Defending/Explanation
okay so why don't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what what the choices might be for these?	Offer
yeah i'm curious to hear what it is.	Floor Grabber
okay length is um you want to get this over with as fast as possible.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah if you try to load really long waveform into x. waves you'll be waiting there for	Defending/Explanation
um about whether the the i b m transcribers should hear a single channel audio or a mixed channel audio.	Floor Holder
probably over the summer it'll be the same.	Statement
and then it was like the end of the meeting.	Statement
what language was	Acknowledge-answer
well i don't know how may i how	Other Answers
uh so he's talking.	Statement
you know maybe you could make it twenty five.	Offer

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.	Accept
no absolutely i agree.	Accept
these smooth envelopes.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and the the another question that when i review the the the work of javier.	Statement
my thought is uh particularly if you take the log try it.	Action-directive
um i can yeah i mean i i think can probably schedule ten people uh whenever.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so sure.	Accept
because that'll would be more interesting data if there is like.	Defending/Explanation
yeah but i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both.	Offer
as long as you as as long as you're not tempted to sit there and keep fiddling with the volume controls going can you talk a bit louder.	Accept-part
the other thing also is that i'm asking for the variety of english and i did just put american british indian and other.	Topic Change
i guess we sort of uh	Statement
it skips yeah.	Collaborative Completion
because right now we have almost no money.	Defending/Explanation
but but you can't do it	Dispreferred Answers
that kind of makes sense.	Statement
so this is the first thing.	Statement
so so this means that people with hearing problems would hear uh uh one of these announcements better if it were a male voice then.	Floor Grabber
because if we if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data.	Defending/Explanation
big micro arrays.	Collaborative Completion
i didn't read carefully how they actually implemented it.	Downplayer
actually actually i i thought that's what you were giving us was another meeting and i was like oh okay.	Statement
then he has each of these and things.	Statement
so i think that it it would be good	Offer
i don't think it matters.	Other Answers
uh i didn't do much more for noise estimation i just tried this.	Floor Holder
right but in what we've done so far because we didn't have any special provision for c zero we just treat it as as any of the other features	Accept
uh if if you if you had nothing else.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah with fricatives and with like uh	Accept
but what'll happen is is he'll go back up there and uh pratibha will come back from from uh the east coast.	Statement
and um they were initially spelled out that way.	Floor Holder
but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be	Rising Tone
maybe concerning these still these meeting digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's to separate the ears.	Defending/Explanation
because we still	Defending/Explanation
yeah that's what i used to do too.	Floor Grabber
the that's true too.	Accept
because we're people who've talked to each other.	Defending/Explanation
because i i have several i have uh uh them uh library tools from uh festival and of from edinburgh uh from cambridge uh and from our department.	Defending/Explanation
you know the so is like disconnected from the	Statement
what uh i mean can you spare like a minute or two of a	Yes-No-question
walk a scenic route?	Declarative-Question
and that is some sort of analog input for something like this.	Defending/Explanation
so so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence.	Offer
did you happen to notice how much uh the change was due to just this frame dropping problem?	Rising Tone
it it pretty good.	Collaborative Completion
they're going to be goal directed.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because we they didn't say t.c.l. they said tickle.	Defending/Explanation
and there's also	Statement
we could try doing some.	Offer
you weren't interested	Statement
yeah i just wonder like what influences them to think of twosome gruesome.	Floor Grabber
raspy i mean.	Misspeak Self-Correction
without uh with uh silence or with overlapping.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because if there was no other energy there you're just subtracting exactly the noise.	Understanding Check
um mainly uh methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and now we're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets what it sounded like?	Understanding Check
do you want to have give choices and have them circle one or	Or-Question
so is like biking there part of like driving there?	Yes-No-question
so you're suggesting	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and then there will be some things you know many things that don't work out well.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah is there a narrow is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern?	Or-Question
spend the whole time reading digits with different quantities.	Statement
in in our real life setting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because it's not backed up.	Defending/Explanation
because we write it once and then we never touch it again.	Statement
because that that's going to spread out these distributions really a lot to not do any kind of normalization.	Defending/Explanation
in a way	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
you're talking about the meeting with hynek?	Understanding Check
so what what do you mean exactly by putting back the pitch in	Wh-Question
on line norm.	Mimic Other
because it's you know the s r i system is gender dependent.	Defending/Explanation
and you get dogs to cock their heads and stuff.	Statement
but i should be allowed to.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so uh from from these charts are	Floor Grabber
oh you just take the switchboard trained	Understanding Check
um i'll tell you later.	Floor Holder
i'm not sure which one is which.	Other Answers
i've been thinking about it a little bit here about the uh this um	Statement
but other than that it's really pretty continuous.	Statement
because you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it.	Defending/Explanation
so what's the block diagram for the one above it?	Wh-Question
i'm just thinking from a discourse point of view it'd be very interesting to somehow mark i'm talking to the computer.	Defending/Explanation
i mean we could.	Maybe
i was told by my parents that i used to mumble a lot.	Rising Tone
and then when they're finished with it it comes to you.	Statement
what about something like how comfortable are you in a meeting conducted in english?	Offer
and then this this real uh long shot thing would be that we'd apply dave's processing to uh potentially training and test data.	Statement
oh i'd be delighted.	Statement
what i've done i've	Statement
oh well that's not bad.	Acknowledge-answer
um yep.	Floor Holder
well hans-guenter will be here next week.	Statement
yeah you just have to rely on your intonation.	Floor Grabber
it would be good to normalize with respect to that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because you have leakage into other microphones.	Understanding Check
oh build other other detectors on different phonetic features?	Understanding Check
but the n.s.a. group is just very very many.	Statement
so so uh but uh	Floor Holder
we know that there's a there's a uh a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than uh we're going to test on.	Statement
the dialogue kinds of things.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i tried	Statement
but we have more results to compare with network using without p l p.	Rising Tone
okay so anyway so that's another decision.	Floor Grabber
uh so a little more like brain surgery i think.	Floor Holder
and other than that the system configuration was identical.	Statement
i mean you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars.	Understanding Check
do the summary.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and then you i plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time.	Statement
it was mostly about finding those bugs.	Defending/Explanation
and then you looked at the amount of energy in that.	Offer
and with adaptation it's forty seven point one.	Rising Tone
but is it against the law to actually use a tool to help your job go easier?	Rising Tone
and they email it out for minutes.	Statement
but i prefer i prefer at at the first uh the the silence with uh this uh this kind of the of uh of noise.	Defending/Explanation
so if you took the system the way it is now the way it's you're going to freeze it and it ran it on the last evaluation where it would it be?	Wh-Question
at least least not in not on ones that that really	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah that's the training data.	Accept
but in the short term unless you have some some strong idea of what's wrong	Offer
well we can talk about that later.	Offer
oh okay so you just do it that way.	Acknowledge-answer
and those data were actually used in some analyses which showed uh very very good results.	Statement
i mean you're going to do what you're going to do.	Rising Tone
a few times.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah okay i i'll give you the short version.	Commit
i mean that happens in most meetings.	Statement
so the stuff on the numbers you got the two point seven is that using the same training data that the s r i system used and got one point two?	Rising Tone
and they just kind of go from site to site.	Humorous Material
yeah so it's not where did you grow up but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of what would it be five and twelve or something like that?	Rising Tone
do you think it might be from the	Yes-No-question
he might work on improving the noise estimate.	Statement
and i haven't really calculated	Defending/Explanation
yo.	Floor Grabber
uh audio he did it.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
we could still do the beep file.	Offer
but i wonder if it's just because maybe macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than t i digit is.	Defending/Explanation
i i don't think you understood what i what i said.	Negative Non-no Answers
yeah i definitely agree with that.	Accept
so that's why i want to put that's why i want to put optional age.	Defending/Explanation
this is on clean on clean stuff yeah.	Mimic Other
but he yeah he's he's right.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
or or one of the authors and feel they'll you're okay.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then as a uh separate but related task	Statement
and so so what i'm saying is that if we hire an external service i think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour.	Floor Grabber
some people at at uh yeah at brown and and and and at uh um and at cape.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh uh then i don't see how that would make it louder.	Floor Holder
uh it's great if people are already taking that into account.	Rising Tone
i mean in experiments that we did a long time ago	Statement
but lessen it if if it's desired.	Defending/Explanation
and this is windows?	Declarative-Question
because we're always going to want to go through this preprocessing.	Defending/Explanation
and perhaps even um use networks that doesn't do classification.	Offer
so so you'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each of these two and each of those one or what?	Floor Grabber
four more wireless.	Statement
uh no no no.	Reject
so going to versus going to and that kind of thing.	Defending/Explanation
is the problem the lapel?	Rising Tone
a p.c. and a peanuts.	Collaborative Completion
uh then you have if it's uh there're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words.	Statement
and then the same channel starting at eleven.	Statement
yeah but then there's	Negative Non-no Answers
i mean ultimately if you have if you can offer that information somebody's going to do something with it sooner or later.	Statement
or i know how to spell that now.	Statement
but if if that's not feasible i will do it with you as an advisor.	Offer
it was very weird.	Statement
so i i think i think we should start doing that.	Offer
no we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to	Negative Non-no Answers
everything was in the same order but they were the individual syllables were played backwards.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
that's way too confusing.	Defending/Explanation
and i'm i'm just not sure what that is.	Other Answers
no one wants to own the project.	Statement
i got that.	Acknowledge-answer
so in some sense it's it's there.	Dispreferred Answers
we'll find out.	Statement
the the training of the h t k?	Understanding Check
that's what i just wondered.	Statement
uh make your make notes or something that that this is you know something worth looking at.	Offer
so it was um i think it was twenty one frames.	Statement
uh recursive action?	Expansions of y/n Answers
and for those type of tasks it it's much more efficient to present uh the present a bunch of uh clickable buttons or whatever.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah i mean over all our data we we want to not downsample.	Accept
yeah all all of these.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
when you have noise there is no	Statement
i can't remember the name of the corpus.	Other Answers
quite right quite right.	Accept
one thing um i noticed is that um the mean subtraction seems to make the p z m signals louder after they've been re synthesized.	Statement

what do we do?	Wh-Question
very complex uh yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
for stephane.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean things like rewriting this transcriber tool.	Defending/Explanation
because the first time when we didn't have them numbered we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed.	Defending/Explanation
because we had tagged these word strings um that that occurred right before these these uh interrupt locations.	Defending/Explanation
some company that we were going to uh was going to lend it to us something like this.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's just sometimes it works out that way that they.	Rising Tone
i think that when we do that world release it should be the same.	Offer
i we already have one.	Statement
if that's the way he uses it.	Defending/Explanation
three or four percent absolute.	Statement
specify the age range.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so so my my search was pretty cursory.	Floor Grabber
so it is the digital	Understanding Check
so we should do that at some point.	Offer
uh um and um	Floor Holder
uh in any event they might ask a second question.	Floor Holder
what could be the other low level detectors i mean for other kind of features?	Wh-Question
and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it.	Rising Tone
no i think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form.	Assessment/Appreciation
huh would you want um uh a transcription of something like that?	Floor Grabber
if we have speech from the laptop should we just uh excise that from what we send to i b m?	Yes-No-question
the recognition also takes non negligible amount of time.	Defending/Explanation
or it could be you know so-and-so and so-and-so are married.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i assume so actually.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
barry you've been pretty quiet.	About-task
sitting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and um and they have a map.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches like well the kleinschmidt approach.	Statement
do you have a pitch detector that you're using?	Rising Tone
so business is supposed to uh be sort of it like professional type stuff?	Understanding Check
it's it's it's hand coded.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
well that's what morgan mentioned to me too.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah good	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah they're like those.	Accept
and um and fey has some thirty subjects lined up?	Understanding Check
so this is not a lot of people.	Statement
we we we could simply not do the project.	Offer
make it a voluntary thing.	Offer
i thought that maybe you would be the the person to talk to.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i think there are a lot of ways to do it.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh yeah it's around fifteen to twenty percent.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
well now	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
well sss you know	Statement
just listen very carefully to what i say.	Action-directive
so you just want to have them all pointing to a summary thing?	Offer
because um with this way of dropping the frames they improve over the baseline by fourteen percent.	Defending/Explanation
or maybe percentage isn't the right word.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so the things that we um uh	Statement
i think you can you can put them in pretty reliably in synthetic speech.	Offer
so it works only for italian by for using a v.a.d. to estimate noise.	Floor Holder
so who did you talk to?	Rising Tone
but because you have these non causal windows you're getting these funny things coming in.	Statement
you could do this.	Statement
cool!	Assessment/Appreciation
like if you had transcribed it you would have had an easier time differentiating them.	Rising Tone
i thought they said they wanted everything by	Understanding Check
i mean i mean you notice it in various ways like simply trying to meet with a professor during office hours.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what sort of classifier	Wh-Question
i trained on clean t i digits.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and how often they you've seen them yeah.	Collaborative Completion
but if we'd said okay now all eight of you have to have to come up with uh the	Defending/Explanation
so so are you going to uh is there going to be some sort of mark for that?	Rising Tone
uh i mean one could argue about the l d a and so forth.	Floor Holder
are we are we are we there?	Rising Tone
yeah but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something.	Floor Grabber
well or or not even higher level.	Misspeak Self-Correction
you see the idea is that the um initial decision to that that you're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly.	Reformulate/Summarize
so these undergrad students are really helping us out a lot.	Assessment/Appreciation
well could you?	Rising Tone
and we can see that in the situation uh the m s g three the same help nothing.	Statement
copy it somewhere else.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too.	Offer
so maybe we need to think about it a little bit.	Negative Non-no Answers
i have one.	Humorous Material
it uh uh unfortunately it takes me a week at each site.	Assessment/Appreciation
just by concatenating files together.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then like if if that v a d is going to be a realistic one then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around i mean the way we want.	Statement
how to do this	Wh-Question
you need some microphone.	Statement
uh what else is going on?	About-task
because you guys are probably mostly going to get icsi people here.	Defending/Explanation
maybe we should consider also um starting to build up a web site around all of these things.	Offer
but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently.	Statement
yeah i yeah but uh i i is my my own vision of the of the project.	Statement
but they were they seemed pretty good.	Assessment/Appreciation
are they doing some nice integer multiple of of sixteen?	Rising Tone
i'll let me raise the gain on that a little bit.	Commit
i still don't really know.	Defending/Explanation
yeah we don't even know what to do with their cycles.	Acknowledge-answer
and the all the the speechcorders?	Declarative-Question
it's multi scale because you use several of these in parallel?	Understanding Check
so in the half hour or so that i'm doing i'd just as soon put it in.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so there'd be a subset of them used for obviously just use the ones at this end for for this many.	Defending/Explanation
right that's what we've done so far.	Acknowledge-answer
and um the first stage of these features correspond to what's called the peripheral auditory system.	Statement
what's the problem i i i i see in in in if you you use the the neural network?	Wh-Question
we actually exceeded the delayed deadline by another day.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because it's like how do you you know how much do you laugh after someone's joke?	Defending/Explanation
huh i guess not.	Reject
and you probably go screw this.	Statement
but maybe it's a good way to start.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
okay let's do it that way.	Acknowledge-answer
group.	Self-talk
but um are the only two possibilities from sony the two that we've tried?	Rising Tone
um the other thing though is that	Floor Grabber
uuu	Floor Holder
underscore e for entity.	Accept
when we train on data that is in one sense or another similar to the testing data then we get a win by having discriminant training.	Statement
well because no one no one ever responded with any items.	Defending/Explanation
linguistic data consortium.	3rd-party-talk
they've been doing for the last couple of years.	Rising Tone
i'm going to pass out.	Statement
where where is it?	Wh-Question
but i i will send him an email and tell him exactly what we are doing.	Commit
for adaptation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uhhuh yeah yeah.	Continuer
so the l d a and the v a d both had a hundred millisecond delay.	Statement
well except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth.	Negative Non-no Answers
and this new system has eighty nine.	Rising Tone
with what targets?	Declarative-Question
two or three.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i um i've been i i was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up.	Statement
have you tried it yet?	Rising Tone
and i guess when sunil gets here he can do his last or something.	Offer
that that have you know which could be turned into speech.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's uh so it was just a comment on the software not a comment on prescriptions on how you wear microphones.	Defending/Explanation
and so my point was just that it's it's going to be differentially differentially valuable.	Reformulate/Summarize
then um voiced regions would be like probably more informative for energy.	Statement
someone in the audience yesterday was asking well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not.	Statement
so the one i'm thinking of is like if like ha ha.	Statement
like exponentially.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean non native speakers is what i meant yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
didn't say anything?	Collaborative Completion
uh this will almost not affect the final score because this improvement because the improvement uh relative to the the baseline is small.	Defending/Explanation
um some result and that's then then used.	Statement
uh for go there.	Statement
and the other is it it gets used.	Expansions of y/n Answers
since it's you know a recognizer's going to do better on those anyway.	Defending/Explanation
well one	Floor Grabber
uh about the same.	Statement
you know um if you if a multi band approach was helpful as as i think it is.	Statement
and i'm not sure what we have in there that isn't already modeled in something like um p.l.p.	Other Answers
or do you want me to talk to him?	Or-Clause
change the what?	Signal-non-understanding
um and then the other thing i was thinking about and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form.	Topic Change
leah leah noticed this one where i said something and um the transcriber interpreted it as twosome gruesome uh different sizes different this.	Rising Tone
and the unfortunately the table top ones	Statement
well has anybody done anything?	Yes-No-question
you have you have people who are highly confident when they really should be a little bit less confident.	Rising Tone
yeah the one in the	Accept
because beforehand you have these these traps and you're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme.	Defending/Explanation
so it's hard to know	Assessment/Appreciation
not with these around.	Humorous Material
because i actually was running on a different experiment.	Defending/Explanation
you saying that there's an arrow right here?	Understanding Check
yeah it's it's midnight but	Accept
that's very close.	Statement
yeah we should know what's out there certainly.	Accept
does anybody remember the gui on this?	Yes-No-question
maybe we just do it and see what happens.	Offer
who was telling	Wh-Question
so what was the answer here?	Wh-Question
so let's put it the other way.	Statement
did that help then?	Rising Tone
so we we just have to figure out what the regularities are and and code them.	Offer
it just goofs me up for like maybe a minute.	Statement
how many years did you study english.	Offer
in some cases it divides the error rate by two.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but yes yeah exactly.	Accept
so that that the baseline itself	Statement
because like like macrophone wasn't that much data.	Understanding Check
which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's that's not great.	Dispreferred Answers
so it was positioning randomly?	Declarative-Question
by instead of using the current vad if you just take up the vad output from the channel zero when instead of using channel zero and channel one.	Defending/Explanation
i mean in you recognizer.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you know time wise on a	Defending/Explanation
so one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the uh of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different.	Offer
so uh maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that.	Statement
we were going to do two things.	Statement
so so this tour is sort of just like the idea of current round of of touristness or whatever.	Understanding Check
but maybe a just a small overlap?	Understanding Check
okay then i should have made that as an agenda item.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum.	Statement
i mean the more you ask the more you realize that you're not getting great answers to what you're asking and	Defending/Explanation
uh gets rid of the speech.	Mimic Other
uh so anyway it's just a thought that that if we if we had that maybe it's just a baseline.	Statement
and there are different ways that people approach it and i think we should	Offer
in percent.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i'm not sure who isn't involved with that.	Other Answers
and but you know if it were to be deflated just the normal word it would be like a little story that we could read.	Statement
and i mean this is something you buy.	Defending/Explanation
so i just wanted to make sure that it was clear.	Defending/Explanation
that'll	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
well what about the grand canyon?	Rising Tone
right that would argue for changing the other ones to be digits or something.	Accept
i mean you really can't um	Statement
and that is that	Statement
maybe i can i can edit it a bit.	Commit
is now this endpoint.	Collaborative Completion
i mean are they going to say computer bring up a web page on	Yes-No-question
stationary dealing with	Expansions of y/n Answers
even though that's not what i'm normally going to be collecting.	Defending/Explanation
so you're saying that um um although from what we see	Reformulate/Summarize
about forms in general.	About-task
yeah the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the v a d labels and the final features.	Accept
and and what he had done is he had left the room to	Statement
or drinking.	Offer
yeah would be a for a given segment.	Accept
both for them and for us when we're processing their stuff.	Statement
get	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
well you see so it's complicated.	Statement
for the mismatched they are around like let's say one point five percent.	Rising Tone
um they subdivide into wave files.	Floor Holder
it's just as easy to use to edit the raw h.t.m.l. as anything else.	Statement
so we might want to look into that.	Offer
bunch of stuff yeah stuff is probably bad too.	Dispreferred Answers
but um the probability of speech is not computed the same way.	Statement
so let's make a new node.	Action-directive
yeah uh there was a problem that we observed um that there was there were like many insertions in the in the system.	Acknowledge-answer
and so there's no distinction there.	Floor Holder
it's significantly worse.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
didn't you want to say something about the hardware set up?	Rising Tone
so if we can know what how many words are in each.	Action-directive
you mean pi will be close to one half?	Understanding Check
yeah we we have pretty limited sample here.	Acknowledge-answer
it's nice to have	Assessment/Appreciation
so you don't think they they fill it at all with any you know	Declarative-Question
so i think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all.	Defending/Explanation
student discount.	Acknowledge-answer
and then you could add a question.	Offer
it must be it must be fundable then.	Defending/Explanation
well one thing so you understand he he he wants you to do this only once for each person?	Declarative-Question
yeah but they don't have that.	Defending/Explanation
and throw out ones that we're not using and so forth.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was.	Floor Holder
later?	Declarative-Question
do what?	Signal-non-understanding
maybe landay can put a student in to be a note taker.	Offer
both to get the um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it like well i was talking to morgan about.	Statement
thus is understandable?	Declarative-Question
uh on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the uh that workshop we were at that uh uh mark liberman was was having.	Statement
and to um he he wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they're moving.	Statement
i guess the final	Collaborative Completion
so put that those two dots after it.	Rising Tone
um also we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated.	Floor Holder
if you're in the meeting yourself then you of course you'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about you know whether they're funny or not funny or whatever.	Statement
yeah i mean it's just slightly more complicated.	Assessment/Appreciation
they used to.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and since we have a bottleneck here we want to get i b m things that are usable as soon as possible.	Defending/Explanation
in terms of like informativeness.	Defending/Explanation
but i just remember that it was once you learned them it was very neat and concise.	Statement
that's one of them	Statement
so right now we have like uh we have the cleaned up features.	Defending/Explanation
in the meantime right.	Mimic Other
they're actually they have the status of events.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh the	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so um so i had two thought just glancing through this.	Floor Grabber
um i have a list of things that i think were done over the last three months.	Statement
you can sell corpora eventually to the l.d.c.	Offer
what would be the point of that?	Rising Tone
make sure we get to it.	Defending/Explanation
budget.	Statement
if you want to put your credit card numbers and uh	Humorous Material
i i think those are very good conventions.	Assessment/Appreciation
over an entire utterance?	Understanding Check
and if i'm running an experiment right now where i'm changing the number of iterations from seven to three.	Rising Tone
you know so right now we have a consumer of the word transcripts and the speaker change.	Statement
because they wanted a lot more detail?	Declarative-Question
yeah i guess it's similar.	Accept
i mean like i say i'm i'm personally not interested in those for my particular aspect of the project.	Negative Non-no Answers
well then fine.	Acknowledge-answer
what did we have?	Rising Tone
and so that's just whatever it is.	Statement
so there's uh huh.	Statement
uh you know tens of microphones.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's not it's	Statement
thank you very very much.	Thanking
um and then	Floor Holder
i i i bet you anything.	Statement
so i was just thinking maybe just go around and just briefly look what's other things that are going on.	Floor Grabber
and so we're just having we're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know you know there was a big gap in time here.	Statement
or whatever yeah.	Accept-part
because once you get a	Defending/Explanation
and how that is uh specified?	Open-Question
but but i think that that um he's saying people are sort of scrambling for a eurospeech deadline.	Statement
wah hah hah hah hah hah.	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and it's the low energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible.	Statement
which which ones do you are you studying?	Rising Tone
so if i click on here	Self-talk
should we make a keith note here?	Offer
or uh so but there's but definitely a back off position to asking.	Statement
but we have to address the problem of c p u and memory we	Declarative-Question
and i i talked about this with jane and adam.	Statement
by the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things	Topic Change
you know get stuck in some local minimum.	Rising Tone
so your point is will be to use whatever	Understanding Check
but maybe the	Statement
right right read them as single digits.	Accept
so actually everybody who's working on it will be up there for at least a little while.	Statement
so let me suggest this.	Action-directive
even in these cases of high mismatch.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but it was like also really interesting to watch.	Assessment/Appreciation
um it was something similar to online normalization finally.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
right so you have a second neural net.	Accept
because i think i thought that our system was more like forty percent without the wiener filtering.	Understanding Check
that that um for normalization you could do something like take voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that.	Offer
no it'd be even better with this big	Reject
couldn't we dan?	Tag-Question
no so i think they they have actually a very large audio data rate.	Reject
okay now first of all	Acknowledge-answer
yeah some timebins are humongous.	Floor Grabber
uh and uh you know and a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning.	Floor Holder
and it uh it got worse.	Assessment/Appreciation
maybe maybe this is too obvious to be right.	Downplayer
or just overall volume?	Or-Clause
i also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials.	Statement
but uh is uh is an idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
and so the the default uh boundaries that they provide are they're okay but they're not all that great?	Understanding Check
that's eight kilohertz?	Understanding Check
alan?	Declarative-Question
so maybe we should do that	Statement
when they come out with the eighty gig microdrive then we'll just send one of those little things around with all the meeting data.	Statement
or would i be the voluntary uh coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking?	Or-Clause
and then they would say well we talked about this.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's it's it's it was updated yesterday.	Statement
but that's not really like	Statement
it's read.	Collaborative Completion
yeah that's something to be determined something to be specified.	Accept
hey liz what what do the groupings represent?	Floor Grabber
he tries classifying using each of the m. possible sub-vectors.	Statement
that that wouldn't be true.	Dispreferred Answers
how did they measure the performance of their detector?	Rising Tone
how are we going to find that in the data?	Wh-Question
and it's two by two by one.	Defending/Explanation
and then sometimes people would wear these around their necks.	Statement
so these are near near field?	Understanding Check
just so we see something.	Accept-part
do you have this uh	Yes-No-question
couldn't you?	Tag-Question
do you people	Yes-No-question
when you're saying second you're comparing to the numbers that the uh that the best system before got on uh also without german and danish?	Understanding Check
so but i think that's that really doesn't happen very often that that that a word is cut in the middle or something.	Dispreferred Answers
so it's um vector taylor series that are used to huh uh to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra.	Statement
the pin!	Acknowledge-answer
and i've been taking them out.	Statement
but just like i said if there's a a certain topic that comes up in the meeting and that knowing their relationship will clarify it or if there's a certain dynamic that comes up	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i don't know what	Other Answers
instantiate that.	Statement
and i thought maybe that was because i had i took german for a semester and i've had exposure to german.	Defending/Explanation
run hyphen command.	Misspeak Self-Correction
and um i just i just put down some ideas.	Floor Holder
and uh it's that top down thing again.	Understanding Check
or else you'll have apples and oranges.	Defending/Explanation
yeah the less you have to click on the mouse i think the faster you could go.	Floor Grabber
now the alternative to a web site would be to put it in doctor speech.	Offer
so what would be nice is if we could uh converge on on formats and conventions and so on.	Offer
so it's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware.	Statement
they also want to work on this.	Defending/Explanation
that'd be okay.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah so it's not divided between languages you mean or	Understanding Check
good time for you?	Declarative-Question
tourists really do have different styles eating.	Statement
which is i would just say laugh for that.	Statement
and i just wondered if that was going to be sometimes clear.	Statement
well because you clearly see where speech is.	Rising Tone
cognitively it's much easier.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so this test may take quite a while to run then judging by the amount of data that he was putting on.	Understanding Check
i still don't know if these are going to be any good.	Other Answers
and saying we should probably wait until after i'm back.	Rising Tone
also of course it would be really nice to know what the plans are in addition to what's sort of already in code.	Offer
it's kind of weird.	Assessment/Appreciation

okay shouldn't i be able to move them all?	Floor Grabber
and um we've sort of gone through that once before in the deep mail project.	Statement
yeah this is another difference.	Acknowledge-answer
because i i don't think the staggered mixed channel is awfully good as a way of handling overlaps.	Defending/Explanation
or cheapness.	Collaborative Completion
exactly these.	Statement
but these these overlaps that are due to people not knowing other people want to leap in at the same time and and wanting to coordinate you know i think that uh it could be lessened.	Assessment/Appreciation
beep!	Exclamation
yeah i mean i just read the paper.	Accept
sort of like a uh an uh an elevated huh?	Understanding Check
because i think p h d and professor are are distinct.	Defending/Explanation
i mean it seems like probably we have enough now.	Understanding Check
i mean that's like a cheating method.	Statement
and uh it it does work very well under some conditions.	Assessment/Appreciation
um i do have a file also in addition to those things.	Floor Holder
so that's the data that we'll be running on?	Understanding Check

so what they had is if it's an easy task it costs twenty four dollars an hour.	Defending/Explanation
and i'm not objecting to accents.	Defending/Explanation
because that takes about a day to get off back up tape.	Defending/Explanation
so apparently it looks better when uh we use the silence probability from the v a d network.	Rising Tone
although that's i i take it that's something that uh don will will look at.	Statement
yeah so ordinarily in these things it does tell you that it's it's voiced with a pitch of such and such.	Floor Grabber
because um i i personally would not be able to make a claim that those are dramatically different items.	Defending/Explanation
i know she's a big part of the institute right?	Understanding Check
the you're right i mean the main distinction is whether it's voiced or or voiced or not.	Downplayer

are we going to do it altogether or separately?	Or-Question
you know basically you're you're you're doing a high pass filter or a band pass filter of some sort.	Defending/Explanation
but the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet.	Statement
you you have to to to find you can find the the mark.	Statement
so so what you're saying is that nearly always what happens when there's a problem is that is that uh there's some uh uh nonspeech that uh that is interpreted as speech.	Understanding Check
uh actually the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean if it	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so that's another thing we should talk about is making sure that we're doing it in the same way.	Offer
at least this subgroup.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or you uh check on the other things.	Statement
when you use when you go to the large training set then leaving out macrophone actually sometimes helps you.	Defending/Explanation

right i mean we're using a fair number of filters in the filter bank.	Follow Me

so you get the general structure the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary.	Statement
if you connected it all together it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it.	Statement

is it like one stage speech enhancement?	Yes-No-question
also i wanted to mention just in passing that uh another thing that we're going to want to start collecting is queries for the meetings.	Action-directive

a couple people in particular do that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

um backchannels or whatever.	Floor Holder
that's fey.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so is that uh are are these results comparable?	Yes-No-question
your filter is a function of s n r huh?	Understanding Check
the ones that aren't filled out are the ones you want to hand out.	Action-directive
that's so funny.	Assessment/Appreciation
i was exactly.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um i don't think they're designed to be over your ears.	Floor Grabber
does it output the word	Yes-No-question
oh how fun!	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean once you get three sites collecting data and each site can demo it and say it's at the other two sites.	Defending/Explanation
which means basically in inside pauses.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so that means that we have like eighty or so hours.	Statement
but that's not allowed.	Statement
now if it could all be pre marked at some you know good	Statement
but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is	Statement
of the speaker i.d. or something?	Understanding Check
so they you know if you were listening to an interview that sounded like this you know you'd turn off your radio.	Defending/Explanation
oh now i have another use for the	Self-talk
yes i agree.	Accept
who fills out the key file.	Statement
no it's just downloadable from their from their web site.	Dispreferred Answers
using the channel zero vad to estimate the noise also seems to be improving.	Statement
so if you can find voiced regions and	Offer
i'm i'm saying fluency.	Defending/Explanation
because they're proprietary.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i wasn't saying that.	Floor Grabber
because the v.a.d. endpoints are not good to estimate the noise.	Defending/Explanation
who is going to	Wh-Question
so i think the other thing i'd like to do is do something about the set up.	Offer
now why do we what's the reason for having like the point five have the nums on it?	Wh-Question
read it single.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah then we'll know.	Accept
you you can keep it on.	3rd-party-talk
you've got stemmers?	Declarative-Question
uh yeah but it does it it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently.	Accept
and so what	Statement
and so you turn it down.	Collaborative Completion
yeah and it's actually does does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched italian.	Floor Holder
do we need do i need to turn something off here or i do unplug this or	Or-Question
um so uh i a lot of that was from you know what what what you two were doing.	Floor Holder
oh i see we have to	Statement
it does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but uh uh i i understand that you your objective is to uh classify to know that uh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file that uh you have uh but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone.	Statement
uh i don't know if it's three p m it's	Other Answers
and and and uh the phones are	Floor Holder

but it's different.	Defending/Explanation
worse yep.	Acknowledge-answer
because people can people can say their acronyms really fast.	Defending/Explanation
for each channel.	Expansions of y/n Answers
there are a few	Statement
so maybe just briefly uh	About-task
uh i yes my you know don't yeah yeah yeah that's enough.	Statement
uh i saw that other mail where he said that he uh it wasn't going to work for him to do c.v.s.	Statement
we're not going to do any get anything done if we do that.	Defending/Explanation
and i i was going to do this very clever phantom power.	Statement
but um got tables in front of us.	Floor Holder
and it means something.	Statement
we might might end up with some longer collaboration or something.	Defending/Explanation
and also what we	Expansions of y/n Answers
in in the program we don't re synthesize and then re analyze once again.	Defending/Explanation
did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables?	Yes-No-question
but i don't think that matters though.	Negative Non-no Answers
i think and uh having having it on wireless is is the neatest way neatest way to do it.	Offer
he says it doesn't work.	Reformulate/Summarize
like say five one seven seven three.	Expansions of y/n Answers
katrin on channel two.	Statement
but maybe the neural net and the h.m.m.'s could figure it out quicker than you.	Statement
since	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
it's the only	Statement
if the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks.	Statement
yeah we talked about that a couple times.	Acknowledge-answer
like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and we've got	Statement
so jim is going to be doing wiring and you're going to give some thought to cabinets?	Understanding Check
yeah we're going to be looking at that.	Accept
how often does that happen do you think?	Wh-Question
yeah that that stuff that people put with the little you slip the wires into that's sort of shaped like that cross section.	Acknowledge-answer
in that case the dialogue manager is sort of event driven.	Statement
but not allowed.	Acknowledge-answer
but i don't think there's any other difference.	Statement
suppose you did that uh got that right.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah that's the european one.	Statement
uh no not quite that.	Floor Holder
those were really hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
and they it's a lot clean.	Defending/Explanation
so that that's one reason maybe we could combine.	Statement
i i forget the reason behind it.	Other Answers
so how will we know who	Wh-Question
you guys didn't have one channel per person before?	Understanding Check
see the i mean the reason i'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and i don't know how seriously to take them right?	Defending/Explanation
yeah i mean read versus not.	Floor Grabber
oh i i	Acknowledge-answer
and so that a decision would be do we want that	Floor Holder
so two people did that um i thought.	Statement
on the overlap category is that overlapping of speakers only?	Understanding Check
are we done talking?	Rising Tone
i think everyone here is on the list.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
wouldn't is that what you'd say with the pie chart?	Rising Tone
although the couple of people that we have working on it have h.p.s.g. backgrounds.	Defending/Explanation
the the person.	Acknowledge-answer
so i mean in	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
have you ever	Yes-No-question
because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice.	Defending/Explanation
but uh were you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between overlap and single speakers by looking at the energy?	Understanding Check
can't it also?	Tag-Question
especially if they also got louder too and they hit it.	Rising Tone
and get a bunch of transcriptions.	Statement
for for that purpose and	Statement
and are are we running this uh for t i digits?	Yes-No-question
did somebody notice it during your talk?	Rising Tone
well i i don't have any of the print outs.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
placing stuff.	Collaborative Completion
but again you're you're more or less doing what they were doing.	Understanding Check
so it would be	Understanding Check
but the just the phoneme string that's used for the alignment.	Offer
and uh so i'd sort of like to know who's going to do that.	Floor Holder
yeah if i had known and here we have all these new speakers i could have gotten lots of digits in.	Acknowledge-answer
you have syntax.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it sounds normal.	Expansions of y/n Answers
how is it	Wh-Question
gosh!	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah after each meeting we copy the data to	Floor Grabber
i can't remember his name.	Other Answers
i know she's here.	Negative Non-no Answers
and about the something about was the agent a tourist or a native or a business person?	Open-Question
and of course you know i mean there's also this other reduction that that we've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says and versus nnn versus you know nd whatever.	Statement
it was like what's going on.	Statement
uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure.	Rising Tone
we can use that for for uh kindling or something.	Offer
yeah but i i think that still overall you're going to have probably three or four or five dominant speakers.	Floor Grabber
because you could have outdoor places that sell things.	Defending/Explanation
uh huh yeah.	Continuer
well absolutely!	Accept
to have sort of you know different	Defending/Explanation
you can remove online normalization or put it it doesn't change anything.	Defending/Explanation
so um they have some sort of an arrangement.	Floor Holder
test it on uh the noisy t i digits.	Commit
um which is under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room.	Floor Holder
oh uh in terms of um if uh if it's it's if it's cut off.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and so this is one approach.	Rising Tone
yeah so so what happened right now we removed the delay of the l d a.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
no one early next week.	Understanding Check
um and then you can ask these other questions as well.	Floor Holder
yeah i mean see i'm i'm thinking that any node that begins with go there is either going to be true or false.	Statement
so um we'll start with transcriber.	Floor Grabber
it's really impolite if you don't.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you have it?	Rising Tone
and and that that um histogram represents the different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency?	Understanding Check
and see what else there is here.	Commit
all you'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does.	Negative Non-no Answers
oh but uh we don't have time.	Statement
because in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up.	Defending/Explanation
and we you know limited machine and human time and effort.	Defending/Explanation
well so keith what do you think?	Wh-Question
so it's well it's spectral subtraction or wiener filtering.	Statement
yeah i mean i don't know if we'd be able to do any thing to help s.t.p. type problems.	Acknowledge-answer
um anybody?	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
uh but their noise estimation.	Rising Tone
user schedule.	Statement
i mean it it's it's maybe like a week's work to get to do something like this.	Statement
in the interest of um	About-task
why don't we try it out and see see what kind of responses we get from people.	Offer
well so it's a	Floor Grabber
so you could have a a fit node.	Offer
i don't know much about as much as i should about the rest of the system.	Other Answers
so we go over so we were we were talking over one another and it's just in each case it's just sort of one interval.	Statement
so i uh did a bunch of archiving and still doing a bunch of archiving.	Statement
and um it occurred to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um	Floor Holder
and you weren't hitting any keys because you were home.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah um we actually biking should be should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component.	Floor Grabber
yeah v.a.d.	Acknowledge-answer
and but i think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting.	Defending/Explanation
like the sixty four hertz cutoff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
little money some money lots of money?	Rising Tone
yeah a lot of these things are.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because i did this in parallel.	Defending/Explanation
um i don't know what mel uh based synthesis would sound like.	Downplayer
she did something where um where the traps	Statement
what we've learned about is overlaps in this situation is that the first the first order thing i would say is that there's a lot of them.	Statement
and someone said oh in the front in the middle.	Collaborative Completion
listened to them in stereo.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we uh reconstructed how that happened.	Statement
i'm getting attacked.	Defending/Explanation
because we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems.	Defending/Explanation
but if you talk quieter the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh do you?	Floor Holder
the modern ones don't do a a simple switch.	Mimic Other
are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record?	Yes-No-question
so what took them so long?	Rising Tone
uh yeah so the second thing is the system that we have currently.	Floor Grabber
and so is your two point seven comparable?	Rising Tone
depends what you save.	Accept-part
but from one picture i don't know that you really get that.	Statement
and then i median filtered that using um a fairly long filter length.	Statement
so what's smartkom?	Rising Tone
those are really bad.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean that's what they had said before.	Defending/Explanation
train train an ordinary neural net to uh to learn the posterior probabilities of phones.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's only one small experiment to know what happened.	Statement
so when when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noise is that at a particular frequency bin?	Rising Tone
just to get some more digits.	Defending/Explanation
uh uh that's so we would be using the same channel for each for everything?	Understanding Check
because i think it includes also important.	Defending/Explanation
i mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on f.f.t.	Defending/Explanation
it's no like.	Statement
which we'll which we'll see in just a second.	Statement
yeah but this is not the this is not just the state of the discourse.	Accept
same	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so are people supposed to assume that there is uh	Yes-No-question
where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision.	Expansions of y/n Answers
would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this?	Rising Tone
because they're always uhhuh oh yeah really uhhuh um reacting yeah.	Defending/Explanation
and in a lot of them you see typos and things like that.	Defending/Explanation
um can i ask a question about the glossing uh before we go on?	Yes-No-question
in what we send.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean anyone can have the transcripts so i thought we could point that out.	Statement
no but i'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for for for for video or for audio where you you need to do this.	Acknowledge-answer
for our transcribers to process things before and after.	Statement
and that's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled.	Statement
so uh did are were you suggesting that it should be more fine grained than this?	Rising Tone
i mean the lowest you would get would be a zero.	Statement
uh well yeah it's worse than a few things.	Floor Holder
yeah i mean we'll just have to try it.	Acknowledge-answer
um the second sheet is uh about the same.	Floor Holder
but it seems to me that really doesn't matter.	Assessment/Appreciation
when you the detect the the the first at at the end of of the detector of um um.	Statement
because um you could just put the threshold and say that below the threshold i will flatten completely flatten the the spectrum.	Defending/Explanation
that's sort of part of our belief.	Statement
or maybe i should do an f.a.q. on the web site about it or something.	Offer
uh in a moment f seek function doesn't work.	Rising Tone
well there's the neural net and there's also this uh uh multi frame uh uh k l t.	Expansions of y/n Answers
took out white space.	Collaborative Completion
oh these are all these the nums point this all where they're saying point something or other.	Statement
yep yep yeah yeah that would be good.	Accept
you know forget it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i think after that we need another uh rack or something.	Understanding Check
man.	Assessment/Appreciation
of the meeting.	Collaborative Completion
but with different segmentation.	Statement
can you do that?	Yes-No-question
so that's okay?	Understanding Check
let's say underbar u.	Action-directive
that's a pretty fine grain that the note taker will have to take.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh jose carlos segura.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement

and put put them together.	Statement
in i'm not.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
when you guys were saying that last week i was like never heard that.	Statement
i guess what you're saying is that the the m l p based one has the spectral information.	Understanding Check
uh i don't think i don't think	Negative Non-no Answers
like was chuck was mentioning earlier.	Statement
ish decay?	Understanding Check
and probably all else being equal it'd be better for me to just have single digits.	Rising Tone
that's a little bit of a problem.	Dispreferred Answers
and found segments that would be useful.	Statement
i mean it's done in the log domain as i recall.	Statement
uh actually the the smoothing that i did do here reduced the musical noise.	Dispreferred Answers
what's the difference between mode and endpoint?	Rising Tone
do you do you have a a pitch detector that you are using in these experiments?	Repeat
and uh we did this uh rasta like filtering.	Floor Holder
that's german yeah.	Statement
you know maybe the problem is we got the kid's version.	Humorous Material
so like	Statement
so anyway so i've been preparing for that.	Floor Grabber
what what we're saying is that one one of the things that	Statement
that that was an interesting statistic.	Assessment/Appreciation
like the downsampling which was simply dropping frames.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so um we should probably get different mikes.	Statement
yeah we're we're doing some sort of prediction of what	Floor Grabber
but probably from these you could've infer it.	Reject-part
you mean non native non native speakers.	Correct-misspeaking
sometimes they don't.	Mimic Other
because if i thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if i didn't.	Defending/Explanation
it's just easier to do.	Assessment/Appreciation
like where would you get the word gruesome?	Wh-Question
yeah uh gruesuh.	Accept
so that's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector.	Statement
that's how we could pay for the transcription.	Humorous Material
right if you're sending at an integer instead of a long.	Acknowledge-answer
so go there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones.	Statement
it really is strange.	Assessment/Appreciation
are you serious?	Rising Tone
no by the moment no.	Reject
i think we figured that it'd probably take a day or two to compute the the	Statement

just you shake them and they fall down.	Offer
yeah let me check with robert again.	Floor Grabber
i mean they	Statement

yeah it's it's not defined yet.	Acknowledge-answer
right the way the way the form reads now i think it's pretty clear that's what we're asking because it says native english speakers variety of english american british indian other region.	Floor Grabber
this is fine.	Dispreferred Answers
just the frame dropping problem.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and we're going to start tomorrow at three?	Understanding Check
i could ask my contacts at the l d c what what it is they actually use.	Offer

um so because because in the ones i've been the one i've been checking actually right now that breath gets marked as a breath.	Floor Holder
this is the well but this is without online normalization.	Statement
i mean they they were not not using the neural net.	Statement
those kind of vocal cues.	Expansions of y/n Answers
different size groups.	Rising Tone
like his english fluency got better?	Understanding Check
but then there are other glosses that we don't replace right?	Understanding Check
but don't they overlap sometimes?	Rising Tone
and uh even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture they're not all going to be used for this.	Floor Holder
but i'm i'm just saying at least as a thought experiment that's what i would want to test.	Defending/Explanation
and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh just putting in the f.f.t.	Statement
we could i was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the m f c c's and just try them with the icsi uh front end.	Offer
but um it requires time.	Floor Holder
and or tends to be used with questions more than so.	Statement
yeah so i think that would be that would be the obvious thing to do.	Floor Grabber
maybe they're fine.	Defending/Explanation
because what you really want to do is scale the uh the range of the likelihoods rather than	Defending/Explanation

now i think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak.	Assessment/Appreciation
hnh nn.	Reject
and um another issue i'm i'm thinking about is in the smartkom system.	Floor Holder

um so either we should regenerate the original versions or um we should just make a note of it.	Offer

do do you want to run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted?	Understanding Check
been looking at synthesizers?	Understanding Check

i also think that wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed.	Defending/Explanation
like you will find more new yorkers in the new york category.	Statement
um we had a silence detector.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
it's it's uh it's it's mostly worse.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel to vowel transitions.	Statement
because the action planner should not be or the dialogue manager in that case should not um have to worry about whether it's interfacing with um something that does route planning in this way or that way.	Statement
i don't know if they do that.	Other Answers
in order to get rid of the effects of noise.	Expansions of y/n Answers

maybe is email easier?	Offer
it's pronounced the same it's pronounced the same as the verb.	Defending/Explanation
one thing that's annoying i think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it's their turn to give their little report or whatever.	Assessment/Appreciation
well i don't understand then.	Other Answers
right that would be the other alternative to make sure that anything that was on the board um is in the record.	Accept

okay that's it for spectral subtraction.	Acknowledge-answer

you get the wrong answer quicker basically.	Understanding Check

you mean in between the segments that they did transcribe?	Understanding Check
yeah when i said professor i guess what i was thinking in my mind was more p h d but not post doc.	Floor Grabber
i would take just a few features instead of taking all the m f c c's or all the p l p's or whatever i would just take a couple.	Offer
because we've talked about like this harmonic tunneling or other things that people have done based on pitch.	Defending/Explanation
so is this uh	Floor Grabber

well that's the concept.	Assessment/Appreciation
because i i i think it's more realistic that uh only consider the the the the silence between the speaker.	Statement
that's obviously not true.	Dispreferred Answers
there was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle.	Statement
i mean so what would you suggest?	Rising Tone
i'm not sure how long it's actually going to take.	Other Answers
uh for people listening to narrow band stuff that's friday's talk by the way.	Statement
no it's the electronics.	Reject
the one i tried.	Defending/Explanation
this comes from traffic and so forth yeah.	Collaborative Completion
would you mind?	Rising Tone
because somebody could grow up in germany but live on an army base speaking english.	Defending/Explanation
so it's before everything else.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we take the first fifteen frame of each utterance to it.	Statement
the typecast?	Understanding Check
perhaps the fact that the the there's no low pass filter.	Offer
using x. x. waves tcl t.k. perl and maybe some c. programs too.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh digits.	Acknowledge-answer
no it has to be has to be error complete.	Reject
i sort of thought that this is not going to be easily processed anyway.	Statement
some two d..	Expansions of y/n Answers
perhaps because if it's if it's too large or large.	Statement

and it'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from.	Statement
so that that was the whole issue with the l.e.d.	Statement
but i hate it when people do that to me.	Defending/Explanation
yeah but it takes too much time.	Acknowledge-answer
um but with context free grammar power.	Floor Holder
every night.	Collaborative Completion
so we i subtract more um noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the uh the utterances.	Statement
you could have a node that's that was a measure of the match between the object's feature you know the match between the object the entity i'm sorry and the user.	Offer
is at what level.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i'd which	Statement
um there are still open questions there.	Rising Tone
and are we going to do anything about that?	Rhetorical-Question
foot pedals i've used transcribing machines.	Floor Grabber
so one histogram per frequency bin.	Understanding Check
if i were to add an option it might be to have an undo for that.	Offer

yeah and also to understand what happens because	Floor Holder
um they they have a system that's uh a multi band um system.	Floor Holder
yeah and i i	Acknowledge-answer
not necessarily in real time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which kind of comes into play maybe not for speech recognition.	Rising Tone
but if down the road you're making use of something as if it is a power spectrum um then it can be bad to have something negative.	Statement
like as though you're going to start speaking.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean it's uh throughout this thing.	Rising Tone
or what component of the system?	Or-Clause
for most for most people's heads.	Humorous Material
oh yeah that's bad.	Accept
like archiving it or storing it.	Collaborative Completion
then three people at a time and things like that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but just you know the arrows showing continuation of a thought.	Statement
but you can still collect the multiple microphones in a similar way and transcribe.	Offer
so i don't have a specific need.	Downplayer
okay do we do do you go around the room and do names or anything?	Floor Grabber
and um feed that through the um all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced.	Offer
i've i understand everything.	Humorous Material
where they said if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition?	Declarative-Question
it's not a speaker phone is it?	Statement
sometime we we change two two things together.	Statement
yeah does everyone know about the lip on the table?	Rising Tone
i and he's they they have this nice mutual condescending joking thing going on.	Expansions of y/n Answers

so we may want to have everyone sign the new form.	Action-directive
you can go you know uh z uh for instance.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah absolutely then you want to have it.	Accept
so a two bedroom cardboard box.	Humorous Material

i'm so sorry.	Apology
how it was really pronounced.	Collaborative Completion
anyway you can probably justify anything if what's	Floor Holder
we jump to ninety per cent.	Rising Tone
so the it's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component.	Statement
okay so this is i think we're going to mainly work on with george.	Acknowledge-answer
so i i thought we we we perhaps we should try to to start with those channelized versions.	Offer
it's not just speaker adaptation.	Dispreferred Answers
those are not necessarily binary.	Collaborative Completion
i think this one needs to be open ended.	Offer
so we we could have a round like where you do two at a time.	Offer
um so the the only question is how much of it	Floor Grabber
i i need uh the exact uh mark of the different uh uh zones.	Statement
i'm more of an acoustics person.	Expansions of y/n Answers
to have better	Collaborative Completion
but like that it got a little easier.	Statement
and in german um set processing is used.	Statement
is is this part of the evaluation just a small part?	Rising Tone
and then you just use those mean values as being the the uh uh signal to noise ratio in that band.	Offer
and we can do that in parallel with some other filtering you can do.	Statement
i think you can't	Statement
and uh i think it's digit time.	Floor Holder

i'll help.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
can you just write something like position?	Offer
because they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this.	Defending/Explanation
rather than just uh immediately going for the the typical sound units.	Expansions of y/n Answers
laugh change it.	Action-directive
what um and so either those is true or false?	Rising Tone
so so you guys have combined or you're going to be combining the software?	Understanding Check
i mean it seems that you could um uh it seems that those things would be logically independent.	Offer
and they were the most vocal at this meeting.	Statement
because you might have low energy fricatives or or uh stop consonants or something like that.	Defending/Explanation
so uh and you did it with a noise source.	Floor Holder
and these don't overlap or these	Statement
undergrad grad post p h d professor other?	Understanding Check
excellent idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh so i have to test it.	Floor Holder
it's like when you see the words it's really hard to follow the argument.	Statement
i always adjust the time bins.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so this is a particular human.	Understanding Check
important thing	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah that's a good one.	Accept
see a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces understand that delay.	Defending/Explanation
in canada it'd be	Defending/Explanation

what you would put in the d t d that's meeting specific?	Rhetorical-Question

i got this mail from	Statement

are they supposed to be point five or point six?	Or-Question
it'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like you know uh opposite of tab that you could hit that it would just sort of move backwards.	Offer
um and starting to uh take information from alignments.	Statement
and that was my other question which is um what sort of information do we want to record?	Wh-Question
oh it's at the top.	Statement
uh so the fourth point is yeah the timit plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network.	Rising Tone
oh it's so funny.	Assessment/Appreciation
she's she's done about half a meeting.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so far i've been trying it only on matlab.	Statement
and so most of the time no one's talking.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um i could imagine that as there's a fair number of um cases where and this is sort of not really hostile but sort of competitive where one person is finishing something and you have like two or three people jumping trying to trying to trying to uh grab the next turn.	Floor Grabber
you're you're you're actually leading the meeting for the most part most of this meeting.	Statement
what's qual?	Wh-Question
what what do you have in mind in terms of um socializing?	Wh-Question

we're just compiling the list.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it doesn't interact.	Rising Tone
this means audio but	Statement

so maybe we should find a day when they're going to be here and and morgan's going to be here.	Offer
let me uh turn that off.	Commit
the only thing i don't like about it is that it's not phonetically very rich.	Statement
so there was a one long path.	Rising Tone
if you had a two hour job and it got halfway through.	Expansions of y/n Answers
a couple were.	Reject-part
so you just want it to go back	Understanding Check
a lot.	Collaborative Completion
as there are slots in the pre segmentation.	Collaborative Completion
oh you tried that on broadcast news?	Acknowledge-answer
i'm really picky.	Defending/Explanation
and we'll move on.	Statement

how define?	Wh-Question

but do you really want to calculate the mean?	Yes-No-question
um build a system that uh classifies these um these uh these intermediate categories using uh multi band techniques.	Commit
modern technology.	Humorous Material
and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at in some sense harmonicity or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it for instance.	Offer
action planning meaning discourse modeling?	Understanding Check
it seems like this would be really hard to guess.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah there was just no way to use the energy in festival that was	Floor Grabber
and um in addition to the speechdat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now.	Floor Holder
but it's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they're set on.	Understanding Check
and then uh maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have.	Action-directive
but okay so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well matched case.	Understanding Check
oh you know the other thing is when you say	Statement
or the or features.	Collaborative Completion
so now what about accents?	Topic Change
so you had a a quarter second delay before uh plus some little processing time.	Understanding Check
so they didn't mean tickle as in elmo.	Self-talk
you don't actually have to write p. make scripts and things like that.	Defending/Explanation
well pratibha apparently showed when she was at i b m that it's a good idea.	Floor Grabber
they all just said transcription.	Defending/Explanation
we've got built in downsampling.	Repeat
yeah all you hear is the squeaky pen.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because it could.	Defending/Explanation
how much space do we have left?	Wh-Question
oh a special dispensation.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean you've still got the maximum	Statement
did you notice the fan difference?	Rising Tone
okay and is the spacing all right or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups?	Acknowledge-answer
uh the the template of what we want to test against generating a summary.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then barry can say something about what what we're talking about.	Offer
yeah what happened to that?	Floor Grabber
because you know at this point we're at the at the really fine grain level of of standardization which i hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before.	Defending/Explanation
i'm talking about the the m.f.c.c. plus i do a frame dropping on it.	Defending/Explanation
um not yet but it's planned to do that.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
that is kind of nice.	Assessment/Appreciation
i guess i mean i don't know if we should talk about this now or not.	Other Answers
because what'll happen is we'll change many other things in the system.	Defending/Explanation
same with six.	Statement
yeah so the only	Floor Grabber
we don't care about the timing of the words just of the utterances.	Dispreferred Answers
so it's like it looks into the future also.	Understanding Check
oh that's a lot better.	Statement
for a second stream.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but other than that it sounds great.	Assessment/Appreciation
there's no statement about cause and effect.	Negative Non-no Answers
fifth page.	Acknowledge-answer
okay let's say i say well that would be hard to do so.	Statement
i mean you also could uh just try to make it nicer.	Offer
and they but they they do it somehow they clean it up.	Statement
it does take a week at each site.	Humorous Material
so jane what's the	Floor Grabber
um but of course we're not going to do that if we don't get money.	Floor Holder
so we gave them four meetings before he left.	Statement
you trying to screw up the the microphones?	Declarative-Question
yeah that is true.	Accept
not during this meeting but another time.	Offer
yeah seriously.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
oh yeah so we should have a look at this.	Acknowledge-answer
uh if we if we're	Statement
and so are each of these low level detectors are they	Yes-No-question
we could do an h.t. access which would accommodate those things.	Offer
okay so speaking of which if we don't have anything else that we need	Floor Grabber
especially because there is noise.	Defending/Explanation
do they know about your pie chart?	Rising Tone
um it should be the the problem with the error channel error.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so if over the next couple of days you find yourself wondering what we talked about in the meeting write down the sort of query you'd like to make.	Action-directive
uh and probably i don't know.	Floor Holder
do they	Yes-No-question
the transcribers didn't have any problem with that.	Understanding Check
so what i did was like i did this.	Statement
uh for other kinds of research particularly the acoustic oriented research i actually feel the opposite need.	Floor Holder
i just wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those.	Offer
you said it would be easy for you to do that top one there.	Rising Tone
is that the right thing to do?	Rising Tone
because you've already gotten the first part.	Defending/Explanation
how does the person want to go there?	Wh-Question
someone currently doing the video thing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so do sort of what he's already what he's trying to do.	Statement
and then within that i guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now to run it uh a particular way and decide on what things are going to be experimented with as opposed to just experimenting with everything.	Offer
all the things that that you've been exposed to in these many months.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and it's so simple even i can use it.	Statement
so i think that adding the the timit categories is a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
especially if you have a tool that can do this.	Expansions of y/n Answers
now these we turn off.	Understanding Check
this is a very different thing than most people can relate to i guess.	Statement
for you it was	Statement
but uh we actually	Floor Holder
if there is	Signal-non-understanding
which could be due to the word pattern.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah but but eventually i mean will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and uh you know and and and in core technology.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah that's just one more.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and first in the experiment one i i do i i use different m l p.	Rising Tone
put the beeps file.	Statement
is there other other things that	Yes-No-question
so there in i mean in i i i'm sure that if that's what you did then they would start telling you about that and then you could get into um various things about ordering if you wanted.	Statement
noise yeah.	Continuer
what about our recording schedule?	Rising Tone
baseline is eighty two.	Acknowledge-answer
hey they would.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so has has anybody tried remotely accessing the c v s using uh uh s s h?	Rising Tone
for one of these?	Understanding Check
because this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish	Defending/Explanation
i guess it's probably on the percentages right?	Understanding Check
who's the background speaker.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but we could.	Statement
um so let me try to restate this and see if i have it right.	Floor Grabber
well you can do it.	Downplayer
or it wasn't it didn't sound quite that rude.	Defending/Explanation
for the fire code or whatever it is.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but i don't think it's aha.	Dispreferred Answers
but it's hard to	Dispreferred Answers
so it so um it's it's not using our full bag of tricks if you will.	Defending/Explanation
of of course.	Accept
uh we are between their two systems.	Floor Grabber
well we we have a problem with that.	Dispreferred Answers
a lot of time.	Collaborative Completion
group of groups of groups of group	Self-talk
and i tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that module a dialogue manager.	Statement
because i think i think as women it might be easier to differentiate	Defending/Explanation
just it takes you know it just takes five minutes rather than taking a second.	Defending/Explanation
but still it's like it's still comparable to the baseline.	Statement
yeah so that's certainly part of the issue is that right now he's he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency.	Statement
actually i have a recursion that computes	Statement
what's a little bit?	Wh-Question
more data is better.	Collaborative Completion
oh i thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer.	Statement
so actually it it it decreased the the accuracy.	Statement
but if you can clearly hear pauses and there've not been transcribed we should be adding the commas or not?	Understanding Check
and so when you say you're adding something that has the overall shape of speech is that in a in a particular frequency bin?	Rising Tone
so you know the feature sets we had available.	Expansions of y/n Answers
almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group.	Statement
which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and now i'm back.	Rising Tone
mister white.	Offer
i mean the other thing is we could just bag it.	Offer
yeah in fact why don't you hand me those transparencies so that i remember to take them?	Accept
at a mental level that's what we're going to have to sort out.	Action-directive
well stephane was saying that they weren't hand labeled.	Statement
the mean.	Collaborative Completion
i mean i mean the the people i've known who've lied about it i think would just lie about it.	Statement
but it's also finite state transducers i thought.	Statement
is is that it?	Yes-No-question
so liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where it was later found that several of the microphones were turned off.	Rising Tone
it gives eighty three point six.	Misspeak Self-Correction
the top one is done i	Collaborative Completion
let's see four times	Self-talk
nnn the	Collaborative Completion
uh when we apply a neural network is the same.	Rising Tone
i guess my mind wandered.	Defending/Explanation
i mean like if one speaker's voicing and the other one isn't and they're overlapping do we know that the first speaker's voicing or not?	Yes-No-question
yeah that's the reason i separate it out.	Floor Grabber
right i mean once i start doing that i'll have more to say about this kind of thing.	Statement
and um tell me something about x.	Offer
i actually didn't give you the number which is the final one.	Defending/Explanation
we stop voicing sometimes.	Rising Tone
even if you don't have a direct route to that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh forty four point one.	Acknowledge-answer
but um anything after that it doesn't help.	Reject-part
and just see which how much is on each.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or people aren't going to want to do this.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's that's i did that partly to keep track of things.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but maybe we should find some day that liz uh liz and andreas seem to be around more often.	Offer
they're you know they're	Statement

yeah that's that's the way we've been approaching it.	Floor Holder
she was saying it would be nice if they had uh the same set.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
in this kind of situation where we've got nonverbal channels then there's a lot of overlap.	Statement
and um you know it's very clear when you see it when you hear it with the intonational markers.	Statement
only l.d.a.	Collaborative Completion
so one of the things that i've been doing with the digits forms is i've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them.	Statement
you can also end an utterance with uh blah blah blah.	Defending/Explanation
trivial.	Collaborative Completion
oh no oh no.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah if you know	Accept
there was something that was done by um a guy named carlos i forget his last name who worked with hynek who um	Statement

so it's some kind of hierarchical thing uh that sunil also tried um on spine.	Statement
yeah let's say we just did the meeting recorder meetings for our test set.	Accept
so well to be more precise what they have is they have these alignments.	Floor Holder
uh particularly bhaskara and i were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we what we need to do.	Statement

make stuff better.	Reformulate/Summarize

i was supposed to send off uh and um i i sent a note about it to uh to adam and jane.	Statement
but um it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah but i don't know if we really need now a lot of machines.	Acknowledge-answer
because there's a uhhuh.	Statement
but it doesn't actually do anything else?	Declarative-Question
do you have news from the conference talk?	Rising Tone
i didn't follow up either.	Downplayer
about as far as what they're what the rules are going to be and what we can use.	Expansions of y/n Answers

what do i have under user state anyhow?	Wh-Question
it's too late now.	Dispreferred Answers

not the not the scale of the the observations.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean not periodic.	Expansions of y/n Answers

um because it it certainly does is nice to have in there when it when there is something like the training data.	Floor Holder
i'm sorry about that.	Apology
maybe you could uh point it at chuck.	Action-directive
i'd imagine what i would type.	Expansions of y/n Answers
now i know what you're talking about.	Assessment/Appreciation
a vector of the weights as the	Statement
e.r.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um uhhuh.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
yeah the well the	Maybe
slightly.	Expansions of y/n Answers
do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be?	Rising Tone
because that's a lot of trouble.	Defending/Explanation
give them a reward.	Offer
yeah he had he got very good results.	Accept
and then do the same process there um on on a large vocabulary task like switchboard.	Commit
and then at one point she you know at another meeting she she was not sure which channel she was on.	Statement
so we should get ourselves a list of everything we want to do to reorganize the file structure and anything else.	Offer
in that where or when do you actually ask them about that?	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i had to sort of break them down.	Statement
oh excellent good.	Assessment/Appreciation
okay we'll all say what we're doing at the same time.	Acknowledge-answer
i mean that's not going to be true of the foreground speaker.	Statement
because again	Statement
because you usually think bandwidth better bandwidth is better.	Defending/Explanation
on t i digits?	Collaborative Completion
but i guess did did you get enough milestone uh from the description things?	Yes-No-question
i think it's that	Statement
so this is not going to be a major part of the process.	Statement
well that sounds like a good solution one way or the other.	Floor Holder
and so um using this the convention that jane and i have discussed you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want.	Floor Holder
which category do you put that in?	Wh-Question
the signal subspace?	Understanding Check
and also things like repeats for the same information and so forth.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i've forgotten which one is which.	Defending/Explanation
and then you take you find the next feature that's the best in combination with it.	Statement
uh that's not a practical thing.	Assessment/Appreciation
that i i don't think that's going to work.	Dispreferred Answers
so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things which may or may not be a good assumption.	Understanding Check
and then you can pick uh values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters?	Understanding Check
and or maybe post doc change post doc to p h d?	Offer
i i've been using that.	Statement
i don't i don't think that's really right.	Dispreferred Answers
and so i figured that f t p is the best approach.	Defending/Explanation
i think it	Statement
no no no it was like forty something.	Reject
because the caps-lock's in a different spot.	Defending/Explanation
uh christine helverson who's working on this with me from the um aspect of user you know usability and stuff would you know	Floor Holder
you're the one who raised the issue.	Statement
because we are going into a a very powerful uh nonlinearity.	Defending/Explanation
um i did ask about dessert.	Floor Holder
yeah and i'm sitting there bored.	Floor Grabber
but it has to be hand labeled first?	Declarative-Question
if anyone wants to know.	Collaborative Completion
but it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap for instance.	Assessment/Appreciation
anyway that's my thought.	Topic Change
oh ideal would be to have the wall filled with them.	Statement
yeah using foot pedals.	Floor Grabber
that has one of these drives in it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
if i were to be dictating a phone number i would have done that more slowly.	Defending/Explanation
or whether it was f.f.t. bins.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah i mean it's very useful in like all senses.	Accept
then we could compare the two and say what was better.	Offer
uh that's a nice feature.	Floor Holder
but could be very informative.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and compared to um using a twelve second centered window i think there was a drop in performance.	Rising Tone
told me what they wanted as categories.	Statement
do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing?	Yes-No-question
um and it's more predictable.	Defending/Explanation
run it through	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and then also what tools we would use.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean meetings like this are good because we can actually record them.	Defending/Explanation
like you estimate the mean?	Declarative-Question
yep we need to put trackers on it.	Offer
should have some interesting properties in noise.	Rising Tone
but i think she's we're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards	Defending/Explanation
if if we are collecting these at different sites different kinds of tasks different people what is there that's going to be uniform about this collection?	Wh-Question
but but the other question is	Statement
um and then the other thing uh is that i wonder about with it and and don't take this in the wrong way like i i know what i'm doing or anything.	Floor Holder
so for the non linguists what's a fricative?	Rising Tone
uhhuh yeah okay so now i've i've been involved with some of that at at cogsci.	Floor Grabber
can i can i say about that that the the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers.	Statement
good enough.	Assessment/Appreciation
um and anything else anyone wants to talk about?	Floor Holder
i mean that that's	Statement
they have different definitely a different style right?	Understanding Check
you'd compute the weighted average.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh is it something you physically could enter.	Floor Holder
do you find	Yes-No-question
don's and the one across from him.	Statement
or they just tend to peak louder maybe.	Offer
because they don't just say so.	Defending/Explanation
yeah actually we could do that at our site too.	Floor Grabber
can smooth the s n r estimate also.	Offer
because i think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down.	Statement
an easier time?	Understanding Check
it's really neat.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh some other experiment things that people are doing are on there.	Statement
and the one close to you is basmati.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and to come at uh to get a decision about this latency problem.	Rising Tone
haven't read it yet.	3rd-party-talk
um of general spoken english.	Floor Holder
uh so uh	Floor Holder
so that that's interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
okay but i i think in any event we're agreed that the first step is.	Statement
so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that?	Understanding Check
and sunil already showed that with our current v a d we can improve by more than twenty percent.	Statement
hynek was here.	Collaborative Completion
so i assume tcl t k wasn't already on the machine so you had to install it.	Understanding Check
that's how many chairs are in the room.	Defending/Explanation
well he could be reached he could be reached by the far field.	Understanding Check
but i think that i was uh proposed before i was asked.	Rising Tone
who yeah right.	Accept
we need a lot of i mean	Statement
one oh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time someone's email could change.	Dispreferred Answers
it's and i don't think it's going to i don't think it'll get worse than that by the way.	Statement
it's always good to have references.	Statement
uh and so uh the vector taylor series hadn't really worked out that much.	Floor Holder
well i think that um i think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in english.	Offer
i i'd imagine that's that might be what that is.	Statement
because we've been ironing out this path.	Defending/Explanation
and they do their pass over it.	Understanding Check
so she can copy sentences into a window or type really fast.	Statement
oh that's cute.	Assessment/Appreciation
but then chuck came in.	Statement
what exactly is the purpose of the corpus?	Rising Tone
or maybe maybe the other way around.	Offer
um well it i mean it might be that someone here has to go.	Floor Holder
but uh other than that delightful result what was the rest of the paper about?	Rising Tone
i wouldn't even say that that they learned.	Reject-part
and it makes a huge difference.	Defending/Explanation
hang on.	Action-directive
but sometimes it'd just be saying something and especially people who have really elongation in their style.	Defending/Explanation
because i didn't read also the most recent mails about the large vocabulary task.	Defending/Explanation
and if were going to do that we might as well give them jose say it was jose.	Offer
i won't come to your next meeting.	Commit
we already do that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh because the stuff between the harmonics is probably a schmutz.	Defending/Explanation
i mean we're collecting this as to build general english acoustic models.	Statement
and so i guess the issue there is are we are we using neural net based traps.	Floor Holder
but i didn't do that because i was not sure about security problems.	Defending/Explanation
are you certain?	Rising Tone
i think it was in the wall street journal data that that	Repeat
we're starting off with digit stuff too for for for our different for for this um endpointing stuff.	Defending/Explanation
so the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps.	Offer
oh that'd be good that would be good.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
maybe if if if really all you want is to have a a a recording that's good enough to get a uh a transcription from later you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording.	Offer
this that was pratibha.	Rising Tone
yeah that's why i was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in.	Floor Grabber
no but i think the important part in there is that you know if you want to be discriminative you have to have uh you know categories.	Reformulate/Summarize
i mean the box that contains the	Defending/Explanation
yeah i'd just try well however the least intrusive and and quickest way is.	Floor Grabber
speech	Statement
well he did echo cancellation.	Topic Change
the the the the other	Statement
uh do you want to go sunil?	Floor Holder
yeah which	Floor Grabber
yeah you could see it coming and you'd turn the volume down or something.	Floor Grabber
then it's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and people can fill in their own you know post doc or visitor or whatever.	Offer
is this after like did you do some uh replacements for all the different form of okay to this?	Yes-No-question
yeah some	Accept
okay now i wanted to say you've been through a couple of different uh improvements in the methods the pre segmentation.	Topic Change
but that um didn't work either.	Statement
yeah and and then there's all these	Floor Grabber
well frequently that'll also be a misattribution too of voice.	Statement
yeah just pairwise.	Acknowledge-answer
absolutely that's the right way to do it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
okay so i guess i just need to get don to uh	Acknowledge-answer
and then we'll probably want to come back to this and possibly make some other choices.	Expansions of y/n Answers
okay we got to we got to disallow uh traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time sort of	Offer
and so we should talk off line.	Offer
that that's known as found data.	Understanding Check
but they are a little better.	Statement
for every meeting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's like kind of you know somebody's helping me a little bit.	Expansions of y/n Answers
okay so suppose someone says well i don't know if i really heard what uh what jose said.	Floor Grabber
we only used you know uh periods uh question marks and exclamation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean i get these a a r p things.	Humorous Material
end of spurt.	Misspeak Self-Correction
and actually i had uh specific suggestion to start first with the path ones.	Offer
it's good to think towards scratch.	Assessment/Appreciation
so uh uh the the best the easiest way to do that would be to just take you know you make the channel be channel f.	Offer
just simply fluency.	Statement
someone i forget the name and and ney uh about histogram equalization.	Rising Tone
so they've been getting from us the um you know some support in terms of getting the latest transcripts.	Statement
what happens?	Wh-Question
so uh have those the the ten hours that have been transcribed already have those been channelized?	Yes-No-question
this makes sense.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
with with with changes.	Dispreferred Answers
and fey comes on the phone as a human operator.	Statement
i mean it seems like it's not a corpus which is uh has been done before.	Statement
as long as you're	Statement
andreas was wearing that same old sweater again.	Humorous Material
so if they have a better one we should use it.	Offer
you're saying cheat.	Repeat
i put breath laugh in the brackets when i don't know whether it's a breath or a laugh.	Statement
right so my example was not a good one because that's	Floor Grabber
it's eight tape recorders.	Humorous Material
is that the right way to do it?	Rising Tone
there also could be i mean i can maybe see a reason for both working on it too.	Rising Tone
and what?	Wh-Question
right and actually the i was thinking about this.	Floor Grabber
no well but you were you were asking off the wall questions.	Floor Grabber
it's a laugh yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so that forces the dialogue manager to change state.	Statement
and if they're not in the way then don't don't mess with it.	Offer
and so i've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe.	Statement
even if it's just writing things up.	Expansions of y/n Answers
alembic?	Understanding Check
the other thing too is that their their transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse domain.	Statement
it doesn't make i don't think it makes that much of a difference.	Downplayer
the wall street?	Collaborative Completion
because we want to chain together the audio from one particular speaker to calculate the mean.	Defending/Explanation
hundred ninety seven.	3rd-party-talk
this is again really rare.	Downplayer
say this graphic?	Offer
huh with the experiment type two.	Rising Tone
oh this	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
uh but mostly we added one one number which was	Floor Holder
and i was saying uh what are the results you've gotten in the last week.	Statement
uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief net which is going to be the main inference engine for the system uh making decisions.	Floor Holder
she's like i don't know what that is either.	Statement
and they're like what were we talking about.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean have you thought through	Yes-No-question
absolute.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right and and it just seems to totally that that's not the meaning.	Accept
when i realized	Statement
where did you live.	Offer
you know how many filter banks do you use?	Rhetorical-Question
if they can actually do it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
see you may want to call up your computer.	Offer
but i definitely haven't figured it out.	Statement
is it is spectral subtraction typically done on the after the mel uh scaling?	Rising Tone
so we'll take care of david johnson.	Topic Change
nnn i guess.	Maybe
depending on how you define it uh users.	Statement
are they more directional?	Or-Question
and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because we want to suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular uh phonetic units.	Defending/Explanation
i'm i what i think is that why not have the corpus since it's so expensive to put together uh useful for the widest range of of central things that people generally use corpora for and which are you know used in computational linguistics.	Offer
but i mean you shouldn't bother with it if it's roughly gaussian.	Action-directive
it depends very much on the mix.	Defending/Explanation
so i think it's well they'll they'll adopt some convention.	Statement
sure but when we think about the weighting which is point five point three point two it's on absolute on on relative figures.	Floor Grabber
just to see where where i could start off from.	Defending/Explanation
so bandwidth then gets gets actually wider instead of narrower.	Statement
yes it is.	Accept
but it's gives you some noise.	Expansions of y/n Answers
for the first cut that should be fine yeah.	Collaborative Completion
well the answer's yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um actually oh and this directory is not readable.	Statement
so he doesn't know what the answer is.	Expansions of y/n Answers
huh because the the uh budget is horrid.	Negative Non-no Answers
could you fill that out anyway?	Offer
i haven't seen anything for the uh tourist path domain.	Statement
yeah the problem with that for backed up media is uh the sysadmins want to keep them at eighteen meg eighteen gig partitions.	Floor Grabber
this is on clean test set?	Understanding Check

or rarely.	Misspeak Self-Correction
web stuff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well some people speak with their mouth full you know that's a.	Negative Non-no Answers
but at any rate so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out.	Statement
and i'm also wondering couldn't that be included in the data sample?	Offer
but the mari's group mari and morgan i i think what happened historically um	Statement
i mean that's just something	Defending/Explanation
yeah obviously.	Downplayer
like jane for example.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so we have all these wave forms.	Statement
uh next batch of recorded data put together on the c d roms for shipment to i b m.	Floor Holder
yeah well not pitch.	Acknowledge-answer
does that seem right?	Understanding Check
oh yeah oh i agree and we use it ourselves.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
how much memory how many	Wh-Question
so this was adjusted for this one mode thing.	Understanding Check
so you can't rely on that latency all the time.	Statement
but in the next release there will be some.	Statement
uh maybe not.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah that's so that's part of it.	Floor Grabber
apical-alveolar kind of thing.	3rd-party-talk
sure if you want.	Accept
so if you were to use these you have to be careful not to pull out these individual	Floor Grabber
and sometimes um people say where is it.	Statement
i wanted to ask about also the air conditioning.	Topic Change
and it's a little bit better than the previous system.	Statement
and that wouldn't take any extra	Defending/Explanation
because i i've i know	Defending/Explanation
i mean there's a there's a blind man in this in this building.	Statement
and like what e.h. is versus u.h. versus a.h.	Rising Tone
and then the k l t and then the two together again.	Mimic Other
yeah and it's hard to improve on the on the best case.	Floor Grabber
if someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it.	Statement
no we have to enter the park.	Negative Non-no Answers
is it is	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
why do we need that much information?	Wh-Question
yeah those are actually probably just the computer problem.	Accept
because we you know one thing that that.	Defending/Explanation
so up to you.	Statement
i don't know if it's a really a question of me being more changing my speech necessarily.	Other Answers
would even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of.	Statement
uh and the directory for this i call it a s r zero point one.	Floor Holder
we can we can tell which training set gives the best result.	Statement
we should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting?	Understanding Check
would it i mean but	Yes-No-question
we're going to never recognize this meeting.	Statement
and uh um yeah	Floor Holder
so i used channel zero vad to estimate noise as a lesser 2x frame.	Statement
now another question is is there are there individual differences in whether you're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others.	Statement
no by by the moment yeah yeah yeah.	Accept
perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt.	Statement
so we could get some extra space out of that.	Offer
doing	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
or the boundaries.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's probably pretty easy do it to do it in h t m l.	Statement
because can't you couldn't you like use beam forming or something detect speaker overlaps?	Rising Tone
for uh oh for eurospeech?	Declarative-Question
i'm telling you i'm just going to cart one of them away if they stay there much longer.	Commit
all right so um i guess um	Acknowledge-answer
so i've assigned i've i've assigned them to our transcribers.	Statement
who is doing that?	Rising Tone
so would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the uh italian digits?	Rising Tone
what's this?	Wh-Question
l d a filter.	Mimic Other
we will just get joy and jane to do everything.	Humorous Material
well similar but that have shorter delays.	Expansions of y/n Answers
do you need to have an added layer or something.	Statement
uh i guess because we haven't wanted to move it.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so there is first this thing.	Rising Tone
well uh you guys doing great stuff so that's that that's really neat.	Floor Holder
okay so why don't	Acknowledge-answer
i'm i'm sorry to interrupt.	Apology
we we load it with data and send it back.	Statement
maybe we have resolution set totally different.	Statement
so um i think i would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings of somebody coming down from campus and and uh	Floor Holder
and uh it's a little bit deceptive if you include the the pre repair part.	Floor Holder
mississippi web site.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right yeah well yeah most of the time when we're listening to other people's speech we're just trying to get the gist.	Floor Grabber
um i i think for uh algorithm based on energy uh that um huh more or less uh like uh uh huh first sound energy detector.	Floor Holder
we just we just have to be in contact more.	Action-directive
nope not the last page.	Misspeak Self-Correction
getting close.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah certainly.	Acknowledge-answer
but it it is something that some form about the individual meeting.	Offer
the way that they have with the longer units.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision.	Reject-part
so the the one suggestion is you know we we run thilo's thing.	Offer
so i'm going to put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number.	Commit
i don't understand that.	Other Answers
uh in this tile appears like the harmonics if you have a voiced sound.	Statement
it's the one in in that corner right?	Understanding Check
it doesn't hurt to have a pad.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i hear this other person's voice just as clearly.	Repeat
i think check with dave.	Offer
because spurts are a defined as being you know five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses.	Defending/Explanation
so run command doesn't use p. make or	Understanding Check
yes ma'am.	Acknowledge-answer
did you see this one?	Rising Tone
because i haven't i haven't figured out which ones they are are yet.	Defending/Explanation
i have one question i get one response.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so what we wanted to do was have jane do basically one meeting's worth.	Defending/Explanation
and that's the same task that mari um a student named dustin and also sarah who was at this last meeting will be looking into doing from the language modeling side.	Statement
i do think that that would help the information retrieval.	Offer
but uh the uh italian training.	Statement
if you want to do a full comparison.	Statement
so um my my the way i do those things when i hear those if is to i use in parentheses one x. so it's marked.	Rising Tone
probably we could probably build that in to the front end.	Maybe
because someone	Defending/Explanation
um they can.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
yeah and they do they said that they could do it for the test.	Floor Grabber
that's another issue.	Statement
how how much how much extra would you allow at most?	Understanding Check
yeah yeah i noticed that.	Acknowledge-answer
if that's clear.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i i i don't know.	Other Answers
but uh the the representation of the data that i was thinking of was using um critical band um energies um over different lengths of time.	Offer
so we have uh that's prepended with a a tag of v.o.c.	Rising Tone
and then i don't think that's very realistic.	Assessment/Appreciation
hopefully by the twentieth the twenty third.	Understanding Check
but uh do do you think that if you consider all the frames to apply the the uh the bic criterion to detect the the the different acoustic change uh between speaker?	Floor Grabber
but that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining p l p and m s g.	Statement
and then have a second row.	Offer
and i noticed that it's better if we take into account this latency.	Assessment/Appreciation
do you take do you take feature requests?	Rising Tone
uh so what are what are the plans roughly?	Wh-Question
there's the crosspad issue.	Statement
switchboard.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um i haven't gotten over to there yet.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
well it's supposed to do.	Collaborative Completion
yeah before you before you do k l t's and so forth	Floor Holder
i had actually earlier asked if i could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff.	Statement
you won't be able to get grants.	Defending/Explanation
it would have to fit.	Accept-part
including.	Misspeak Self-Correction
you sometimes will figure out what the noise is.	Statement
i think it will turn out to be the case that uh this thing we're talking about the extended uh knowledge modeler will fill in some parameters about what the person wants.	Statement
and then we can flag those later.	Offer
got anything to tell us?	Declarative-Question
so that would be uh a reduction of a hundred and thirty six milliseconds.	Understanding Check
swede.	Rising Tone
you get a certain amount of spatial information.	Collaborative Completion
seems so.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
what should be the network input?	Wh-Question
you would or you wouldn't?	Or-Question
so with this uh new stream would you train up a v a d on both both features somehow?	Rising Tone
it sounds like it's a nice smooth melody.	Statement
oh good point.	Accept
i'll ask you who this is later.	Commit
if we could figure out how.	Collaborative Completion
it seems to me that um you know the backchannels per se wouldn't be so hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
well it's it's much simpler.	Negative Non-no Answers
yeah that's the plan.	Accept
you mean that uh you um huh	Statement
yeah well that well we'll have to decide uh how much of where that goes.	Floor Grabber
which we may want to make a little more formal.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is that uh	Yes-No-question
eighty three point six.	Self-talk
so i thought that was very interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
who was like	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
we're going to	Understanding Check
so are they going to	Yes-No-question
yeah so basically you want to reduce this effect.	Floor Grabber
do you mean state or do you mean more broad than the state level?	Rising Tone
when i was doing those i had to really concentrate.	Statement
if you have a choice between people who are more proficient in um more fluent more more close to being academic english then it would seem to me to be a good thing.	Statement
now i i could have adopted a similar convention for percent.	Assessment/Appreciation
so so what are you guys doing?	Rising Tone
finished being transcribed.	Expansions of y/n Answers
especially um the interaction of them rather than just note-taking.	Statement
well then we really should just send the stuff.	Offer

make sure you don't send them three hours of bzzz or something.	Offer
so if we could or if you could do some of it	Statement

yeah in many cultures it's not bad manners to to speak on top of another one.	Statement

so but things are moving ahead.	About-task
i mean i've i've heard i've listened to the data.	Defending/Explanation
so people won't even have to worry about uh doing speech-nonspeech then.	Understanding Check
i mean not not by a huge amount.	Defending/Explanation
because what we that's the problem we're trying to solve.	Defending/Explanation
yeah not if you have to distribute the video also.	Floor Grabber
and then uh maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools and so on.	Offer
that's really good.	Assessment/Appreciation
so in fact it might be a very nice thing to do to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he's looking at and uh generate new files or whatever and and uh uh and then do the reverberation part.	Offer
maybe next week if we could.	Offer

uh they have some cepstral modification.	Statement
and they just have better intuitions or i don't know what but about what's said.	Defending/Explanation
and even on on a more basic level the the action planner actually needs to be able to have um an expressive power that can deal with these structures.	Statement
i i i don't think it's important but i also don't think it's an important point the other way.	Statement
that's right in fact i i pulled out a couple classic examples in case you want to use them in your talk of	Accept
well i think that we i mean the the the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down we need to do a bunch of recordings.	Offer
like whispers kind of.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then use it you know in combination or alone or or whatever.	Offer
so the question is do you know of resources that we could use?	Yes-No-question
so cross correlation is pretty sensitive.	Statement
are those going to be parameters that are frozen nobody can change?	Rising Tone
is that the channel limitation cutting in?	Yes-No-question
what if you could tell them that you'll give them the the transcripts when they come back?	Offer
so that would be yeah that would be something to look into.	Offer
you know it's kind of it's fair enough.	Statement
um we	Floor Holder
well and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately.	Floor Grabber
uh moving from having the first transcription done by an external service and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves.	Floor Holder
that's why we did it.	Statement
so right in here you have this bar that you move and as as you go along it	Floor Grabber
and uh the movie theater is probably also uh is attend et cetera.	Floor Holder
right we need we need some kind of browsing.	Accept
so you're you're not just cutting you're not doing scissor snips.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean you won't be able to show any results.	Defending/Explanation
and then get an update on the electronics.	About-task
isn't it the t.c.p. buffer some	Yes-No-question
you bet.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um i know i have something in the morning which i don't normally have.	Defending/Explanation
um but uh i but uh i i i mean that uh uh in the in the mixed file you can find uh zone with uh great different uh level of energy.	Floor Grabber
yeah i noticed i was afraid you'd i shouldn't say that.	Statement
what does nine work in?	Wh-Question
oh so you're only using the silence.	Understanding Check
so i can i can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we're	Offer
yeah for for sure i will.	Accept
is that something we need to talk about at the meeting?	Rising Tone
yeah or or both.	Accept-part
uh did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers?	Rising Tone
and this is without the channelized interface.	Defending/Explanation
uh what i mean is we we should leave the part with the audio in the uh beep file that we send to i b m for that one.	Offer
um right uh let's see the the	Floor Holder
yeah that's why we bought the expensive microphones.	Defending/Explanation
the m.m.	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so what's the difference between the second	Wh-Question
yeah the reason why why we did that with the silence probability was that um	Floor Grabber
because then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that.	Defending/Explanation
that's that's really not not normal.	Dispreferred Answers
is that true?	Rising Tone
and ring the buzzer.	Offer
and uh transcribe on that basis.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then do some online normalization.	Offer
and it will take maybe five or six times real time.	Defending/Explanation
the the p d a is messier.	Understanding Check
i definitely think so.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
if it sounds like it's almost always right and there's not any big problem you send it to them.	Offer
tell them which things are near each other.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but how would you do that automatically?	Defending/Explanation
well go ahead.	Action-directive
it's part of why you have such good directionality with with two ears.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's an idea.	Maybe
but i think we might be able to do not too bad a job of separating out uh segments that appear to come from a single speaker.	Offer
it also	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so m f c c.	Expansions of y/n Answers
did she hear the did she actually hear it?	Rising Tone
i'm serious that that it it	Defending/Explanation
and uh let's see.	Floor Holder
get get paid for click throughs?	Declarative-Question
so it should be a really short meeting i hope.	About-task
it's a great environment.	Assessment/Appreciation
it'd be a lot of work.	Statement
but the thing is i think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that	Defending/Explanation
um so there's a variety of sort of different sorts of constructions.	Floor Holder
very annoying.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah you're going back today.	Topic Change
but they don't expect anything in return.	Defending/Explanation
yeah that would be nice.	Accept
and i would hear people speaking to me.	Rising Tone
are we going to run out of disk space by the way?	Yes-No-question
because i can't	Defending/Explanation
when when this is sent to to the i m uh i b m transcribers i don't know if if they can tell that's really	Other Answers
because otherwise we're going to learn a lot about this air conditioning.	Defending/Explanation
uh uh thilo can you tell us about all the work you've done on this project in the last uh last three months?	Floor Holder
i have uh two hundred and thirty more or less overlapping zones and is similar to to this information.	Statement
mailing lists.	About-task
like one person gets the version with the zoo as a choice and the other person gets the	Expansions of y/n Answers
well yeah that's true too.	Accept
it doesn't do any speech recognition does it?	Statement
yeah we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog	Statement
we don't have to give them money?	Declarative-Question
it worked good?	Declarative-Question
and the german speakers i found a little bit easier.	Statement
i mean if we	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah i have i i i don't have it up here.	Acknowledge-answer
that that's what i mean is that i think it gets at something interesting.	Statement
and well some people from o g i are working on a paper for this.	Rising Tone
so the d s are for um the interruption points of a disfluency.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or we can just be careful at the terminal side to send a couple of more frames before and after.	Offer
well make make another directory.	Floor Grabber
when we're yeah when we're done.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um it seems like	Floor Grabber
it's really hard to understand.	Statement
so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody's only speaking a small amount in it.	Understanding Check
and some lines of code were already written today.	Rising Tone
and and all that all that stuff.	Statement
anyway i i let me suggest that's a not a first order consideration.	Floor Grabber
it's true that's very rare.	Accept
you know it's just uh something that's easy to parse in perl.	Defending/Explanation
and then he uses uh and then feeding into that are	Statement
right no one	Accept
but even if you take out all the backchannels	Statement
you?	Declarative-Question
it was more personal.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
then the l d a filter.	Collaborative Completion
obviously not everything we did but but sort of highlights that i can can tell some outside person you know what what were you actually working on.	Expansions of y/n Answers
actually i will go through this in in order.	Statement
but if i can tell something if somebody goes i'll put an r. .	Statement
so our truth may not have really been true to the acoustics.	Defending/Explanation
see what i mean?	Rhetorical-Question
well if you compare the first figure to this one	Rising Tone
minutes.	Collaborative Completion
and uh see what it looks like.	Expansions of y/n Answers
this is a different net.	Negative Non-no Answers
so basically make it more tree like going backwards?	Understanding Check
but when you look at the spectrogram if you don't have any smoothing you clearly see like in silence portions and at the beginning and end of speech you see spots of high energy randomly distributed over the the spectrogram.	Defending/Explanation
all the way through the entire meeting.	Statement
oh uh yu ching?	Understanding Check
well there are different things that you can do.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i hate the sony ones.	Assessment/Appreciation
in addition yes.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i was asking if we could to uh kind of make it just whatever is happening rather than one or the other.	Offer
that could be very interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
but i mean um just wondering really.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah you were having some wrist problems and stuff.	Accept
well you could have t.i. you know she put her dirty laundry in the clean clean bathwater whatever.	Statement
you could write a script uh which called run command on each sub job.	Statement
you have candidates.	Collaborative Completion
put it in.	Action-directive
but that through um statistical training and the e.m. algorithm um at the end of the day we have um we have learned something about these these latent um latent variables.	Statement
and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before.	Statement
so it might be just some	Statement
that's two bad.	Assessment/Appreciation
and other good online normalization.	Statement
so are we done with acronyms?	Floor Grabber
because i mean that is just looking.	Defending/Explanation
uh i'd like to see how far off we are.	Statement
uh i have found more or less the same result.	Statement
i i so in terms of like when you're going through the tigerfish transcripts you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases.	Understanding Check
so i mean it probably there's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it's it's pretty mild.	Statement
tone whatever.	Statement
um and we computed how many overlapped uh spurts there were and how many overlapped words there were um for four different corpora.	Floor Holder
you mean the training.	Understanding Check
and you're saying two hours uh is digits.	Understanding Check
was hari on the on the phone?	Yes-No-question
yeah i mean uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part you know the interface.	Floor Grabber
and so there's something that is good about doing it.	Statement
and also for italian actually.	Statement
because we didn't do anything fancy.	Defending/Explanation
very quickly.	Collaborative Completion
so um if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering you probably would put those two sounds together.	Floor Holder
do you you're doing that	Yes-No-question
because i would put a lot of things into parentheses.	Defending/Explanation
right so yeah the training targets actually	Floor Holder
well what's that mean?	Wh-Question
catch some tea?	Collaborative Completion
sometimes the german accents can get a little bit daunting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah another thing that i it's important to mention is um that this has this has some additional latency.	Acknowledge-answer
but certainly the spectra are quite different.	Defending/Explanation
but you know if you get even one	Downplayer
therefore we can put data in it that we don't we don't have to worry about releasing.	Statement
i've looked at i've probably looked at uh at least eighty percent of the data.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what do you mean we're not saving it anyway?	Wh-Question
well ranking didn't before but i'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the german and danish.	Defending/Explanation
i wish we had someone here working on adaptation.	Offer
yeah if it's working well.	Accept
and the third one is to use a single k l t transform features as well as m l p outputs.	Rising Tone
so i wouldn't	Floor Holder
get my parents to do it.	Statement
that's the tigerfish.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well that sounds interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
well five hundred was not so bad.	Assessment/Appreciation
so that for the native english speakers we'll do variety of english regions from the timit labels and another field.	Understanding Check
so did we all said uhhuh and nodded at the same time.	Humorous Material
they're they're trying to put in sort of all of the standard features that people use nowadays.	Statement
expanded?	Collaborative Completion
but the middle one	Misspeak Self-Correction
we need a wider sampling.	Action-directive
you have a special phone?	Understanding Check
these are so funny to read.	Assessment/Appreciation
because then we could claim that everything's automatic.	Defending/Explanation
the uh say again.	Signal-non-understanding
and then she said did i say three.	Humorous Material
yeah read the digits.	Floor Grabber
because suppose we we think that if the variance is high maybe you have uh noise.	Defending/Explanation
is he really?	Rising Tone
and if he has seen it already or not and so forth.	Understanding Check
versus you versus you know and we're catty corner across the table and i'm farther away from this one and you're farther away from that one.	Statement
yeah i think you sent us all a copy of the message.	Rising Tone
if we just take only the um v a d probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far field uh test utterances then results are much better.	Statement
so trying to um implant the intention of going to a place now going to a place later on the same tour.	Statement
you can leave it behind as well if you want.	Offer
so the baseline one baseline is m.f.c.c. baseline.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so i stopped using it.	Defending/Explanation
so you can say run dash command l.s.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or try try to figure that out.	Statement
but what might get at something similar it just occurred to me is kind of an intermediate thing.	Defending/Explanation
but i mean but you would you would you know you'd get good you'd get good pick up at both ends of the table.	Statement
i'm serious.	Defending/Explanation
i've been exchanging emails on various issues.	Defending/Explanation
for this kind of task.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh i don't think so.	Dispreferred Answers
it might be hard if it's at the server side.	Assessment/Appreciation
by how much?	Declarative-Question
or does it use one microphone?	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean to do one turnaround of the well matched case takes like a day.	Statement
i'm just really impressed by this.	Assessment/Appreciation
because it's so expensive to put together.	Defending/Explanation
because you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance.	Defending/Explanation
i do that too.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and all the non native speakers.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you get two	Mimic Other
yeah that was in the first meeting.	Acknowledge-answer
number of words.	Repeat
i mean you were talking about uh the same the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and and looking at it afterwards.	Statement
was that um they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed where they put speaker identifier down.	Statement
it has to work.	Dispreferred Answers
and you got to figure out what to do with them if you're going to continue treating this as a power spectrum.	Statement
by by uh playing around a little bit.	Offer
i'm trying to finish up some stuff.	Defending/Explanation
we we out of tape out of disk?	Declarative-Question
so you send a person too.	Offer
yeah mister t.c.l.	Expansions of y/n Answers
just a little bit.	Downplayer
um and to do more smoothing if the gain is low.	Floor Holder
there's a reason why he's resisted.	Humorous Material
should we already set a date for that?	Rising Tone
well i mean suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones.	Statement
u.h.	Collaborative Completion
if you don't know the file names you can't	Statement
this is something we were talking about before i left.	Rising Tone
but they keep uh two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech.	Statement
a test set training set division.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is it a speed bump?	Rising Tone
so first uh you know we had we figured out sometime last week how to um	Statement
and maybe it's completely stupid.	Downplayer
and within that it may be that it's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet but always always in the publications we have to.	Offer
no i don't mean to discourage that at all.	Defending/Explanation
and we have the same sampling rate.	Statement
and then um dave uh dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they've gotten friday.	Statement
where is the word?	Wh-Question
so uh i i don't remember what you said the answer to my uh question earlier.	Floor Grabber
yeah i just don't know what to do about the other varieties of english.	Acknowledge-answer
and i marked that i marked it with ellipsis.	Statement
one and a half times real time.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i mean because we're we	Defending/Explanation
and um i was going to post some results you know with uh	Floor Holder
getting things uh in more tightly time uh aligned.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and so that's something that don would do.	Understanding Check
so it sort of hooks over your ears from the back.	Statement
no use of pitch uh basically.	Reformulate/Summarize
and so jane is doing primary stress um stress marks as well.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of	Floor Grabber
there's one other slight difference.	Understanding Check
oh well yeah i i i actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it.	Accept
yeah you have to be a little bit careful.	Statement
i i would like to know if	Statement
because you know english.	Defending/Explanation
for announcements and things?	Understanding Check
which could be a kind of a funny delta.	Collaborative Completion
so i was doing it by typing into a text file and trying to fit.	Defending/Explanation
because to me the breath is part of the laugh.	Defending/Explanation
um but because you know the results are are still confusing enough that that um	Defending/Explanation
in one ear.	Statement
well i'm just joking.	Downplayer
because i think you know i've run across it several times.	Statement
but but again like the crosspads i don't think i would base a lot of stuff on it.	Statement
oh i'm really?	Rhetorical-question Continue
because you don't have a map of who's talking versus their name that they're being referred to.	Defending/Explanation
than discourse analyzers.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think they may still do it.	Negative Non-no Answers
everyday conversations.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we already talked about that.	Defending/Explanation
sunil?	Signal-non-understanding
and uh you know and	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
um so you have to just move it back a little bit.	Floor Holder
okay well i mean how is it different from user finance?	Acknowledge-answer
but if i'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence sometimes i'll ry and be try to scan it.	Statement
someone later might be able to take these and say okay they you know at least these are the people who were there.	Defending/Explanation
there's another language that's spoken in spain too that's um	Statement
and show that uh well okay not changing it playing the rules the way you wanted we did this but in fact if we did that it made a a big difference.	Statement
and then uh chuck was taking the role of saying well what did you mean by that.	Statement
but it has to be multi stream.	Statement
to me i don't necessarily put um like a a a a period after that so.	Rising Tone
oh so that's why you were interested in getting your own features into the s r i files.	Understanding Check
i mean not necessarily have the u. dub people down.	Defending/Explanation
uh i would want to drive it with a a a two source system rather than a than a one source system.	Statement
well it's a judgment call.	Statement
uh mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement.	Floor Holder
yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate	Statement
it'll be much harder.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so then it just an ending curly brace there?	Understanding Check
and um and for now uh the the question is how much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection?	Floor Holder
so i think the thing we really have to face is that our model for what's going on is is wrong.	Offer
the huge table	Rising Tone
yeah and this is a starting point.	Accept
we basically you know considered that to be a interrupt as if it were at at the beginning of the word.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh you know this is just uh uh this would this is not statistically verified but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout rather than being localized to a particular region.	Statement
same here yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it doesn't hurt.	Statement
we can write	Offer
and then probability of a given all that is um two out of four.	Rising Tone
is it partly uh correctly identified words?	Yes-No-question
but i also think a consistent licensing policy is important.	Offer
because maybe i could think a little bit about it.	Defending/Explanation
what's an example of a of some of the other differences?	Wh-Question
it's very rare i mean when i've run across it.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i think it's an interesting interesting way to go.	Statement
so i'll go ahead and start.	Commit
doesn't matter?	Understanding Check
then it's fine.	Expansions of y/n Answers
talking to people about that?	Declarative-Question
and different sizes.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um and i guess i used to be worse about it.	Floor Holder
um but otherwise just you know stop that.	Floor Holder
and i subtracted that phase off.	Statement
and it's going to cost however much it's going to cost.	Statement
so that's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after tuesday.	Statement
because it it seems to me that um there's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times.	Defending/Explanation
return.	Collaborative Completion
because you don't have the mistakes in it.	Defending/Explanation
because i think that's a unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics.	Defending/Explanation
was that a combination of me?	Expansions of y/n Answers
well for one thing we're also using this room to collect data.	Statement
so okay so that's the meeting stuff	Floor Grabber
i i mean uh we we kind of set up this concept like a year and a half ago.	Negative Non-no Answers
with that form.	Accept-part
yeah but it definitely got much better when that change happened.	Floor Grabber
i think whenever we use these speech words we should always do the thing like you're talking about accent.	Offer
a half a page is is what we'd like.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it's good to know this.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean it's it's internal until	Statement
yeah there are other things in the um algorithm that i didn't uh a lot yet.	Acknowledge-answer
i i guess i'm not sure.	Maybe
i tend to leave off final consonants for instance.	Statement
is it yen ching?	Rising Tone
what they're doing is trying to bring together.	Statement
have you done that or are you planning to do that?	Or-Question
and another possible thing that we're thinking of is something like uh you know we have these regular wednesday lunches.	Statement
so is it	Yes-No-question
so i think it won't be a problem.	Floor Holder
so all i'm saying is there's there's a kind of question of what we're trying to accomplish.	Reformulate/Summarize
um so there was a paper in i c s l p about um this this multi band um belief net structure this guy did.	Floor Holder
do you want to add anything to say anything?	Rising Tone
well don has a script.	Downplayer
if if we can have a good v a d well it would be great.	Assessment/Appreciation
you haven't seen new disks pop up?	Understanding Check
and that's probably enough for about four meetings.	Statement
so if if this is additional information that could be merged in by them.	Offer
yeah six dollars an hour.	Humorous Material
and then that would tell you whether in fact it's	Statement
you don't know?	Declarative-Question
for this particular kind of application.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well i think that's a little bit of a problem.	Dispreferred Answers
since we're here.	Defending/Explanation
um so i would see us as probably not doing more recordings.	Floor Holder
so i mean we could try another mike.	Offer
yeah just just to see whether it really it's it's is it worth trying or not.	Defending/Explanation
it's a um sort of came out of uh uh looking a lot like h.t.k.	Statement
uh oh i see.	Acknowledge-answer
because we have these two different numbering schemes.	Defending/Explanation
oh gigabytes i see.	Acknowledge-answer
how much do we need transcribed before it's worth doing some trainings?	Wh-Question
it is because we we we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the k l t.	Defending/Explanation
um maybe for part of the meeting we don't have to do it the whole meeting.	Offer
can i ask one more thing about these comments?	About-task
we can go back to the other thing later.	Defending/Explanation
maybe ten percent?	Declarative-Question
i definitely prefer not doing the transcript.	Statement
ideally wouldn't that be something?	Accept
uh so the number is fifty two.	Floor Holder
and we'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds.	Humorous Material
so um uh well i don't think this is a bug.	Floor Holder
that's very interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
because i noticed when jen and i have totally different resolutions.	Defending/Explanation
how many people are those meetings?	Wh-Question
i have one bit of news.	Rising Tone
like i mean what kind of questions are being given being asked?	Expansions of y/n Answers
no i totally agree.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it but it may well	Statement
absolutely there are other situational things that do matter.	Accept
no uh	Floor Grabber
and they they claimed very nice results.	Statement
so i didn't.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah well the detector says there is speech.	Statement
uhhuh yeah yeah absolutely absolutely.	Accept
these are expensive.	Assessment/Appreciation
okay so it's still really big even if you're only one person or two people at most are actually talking all the time.	Acknowledge-answer
i mean if if you want something really really nonintrusive really nonintrusive really something that	Statement
uh but it is uh worse on the uh aurora.	Floor Holder
so i don't think he wants to do information retrieval.	Statement
going to or want to.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it could be pretty small.	Rising Tone
you know can go inside.	Statement
i've been watching for that corpus.	Statement
and i'll go down and get my stuff.	Commit
yeah right exactly.	Statement
that that could be.	Maybe
because i think that that's could be meaningful.	Defending/Explanation
well well okay well let's try it.	Floor Grabber
the advantage is that it's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
no things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used.	Dispreferred Answers
i can i will try to do that.	Commit
so liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data.	Statement
but we should just make a decision whether we feel that they want to use some substantial or some fraction of their time.	Reject-part
yeah i i think that's that's the um concept that people have.	Floor Grabber
i mean the v.a.d. doesn't use the same features there are.	Statement
that maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then offer only one member of that category?	Understanding Check
and couple times there are not.	Statement
uh is it with t.i. digits or with	Or-Question
i mean to cleaning it up once more.	Defending/Explanation
you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses.	Statement
yeah that's no problem.	Acknowledge-answer
i only keep the frames where the two agree that it's speech.	Statement
early on yeah.	Accept-part
we just start out we and you you say transcript l whatever it is.	Offer
but the thing and and the reason that it would be rude is because you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels.	Defending/Explanation
the l d a rasta uh throws away high modulation frequencies.	Statement
yeah we you know.	Floor Holder
or at least sample it.	Offer
but that that's going to be very hard to generate.	Statement
but this is not exactly the result that they have because they've they're still made some changes in the features.	Statement
but other than having a trained linguist interview them and ask these very specific questions i don't see a way around it.	Dispreferred Answers
how do you mean?	Repeat
and before with the system that was proposed it's what it was three point nine.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think both.	Statement
the number of frames is bad also.	Assessment/Appreciation
so after the transcript screening phase.	Offer
i'll i'll take that role anytime you want.	Offer

i'm trying to understand what it means when you do the spectral subtraction and you get a negative.	Statement
filt yeah.	Accept
and that way that one student has you know a rough idea of what was going on.	Statement
it may be worthwhile to at least try a little bit to combine the channels.	Offer
you know uh even with the voiced voiced unvoiced.	Defending/Explanation
i mean it's like in that cluster up there.	Understanding Check
uh but uh actually apparently there are there's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay.	Floor Holder
what's under this threshold is used to update the estimate.	Expansions of y/n Answers

what was he doing?	Rising Tone
if they are good.	Maybe
because there wasn't any anything to discriminate between speech.	Defending/Explanation
maybe should be renamed into physical state.	Offer
so well i'll just really briefly um	About-task
okay so who wants to start?	Acknowledge-answer
and i guess espen.	Understanding Check
yeah good mikes are expensive.	Floor Grabber
they were there.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah that would be let's see me.	Floor Holder
but it but	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
that's the	Statement
and then i've worked with larry hyman on like some of the bantu languages.	Statement
if i have to use it.	Action-directive
anyway you can so they thought about different ways of having windows that you uh work within.	Statement
because in a sense that's the same sort of thing you're taking global information and determining what you how you should	Defending/Explanation
right and it's and i always use i tend to use linguine.	Floor Grabber
and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we're looking for here.	Defending/Explanation
if you're american english it would be region of the u s.	Statement
or more.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you know joe.	Statement
activity.	Collaborative Completion
yeah and the question is how extensive this gets?	Acknowledge-answer
but feel free to overlap.	Action-directive
so we could drop email.	Offer
but you also should probably give them the mixed you know equal sound level.	Offer
so well let me let me expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation.	Statement
and yet you know it's like and instead of instead of and it's they put annette's.	Statement
uh even if there are no digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i it doesn't	Statement
well let's not talk about it here.	Downplayer
but that it's not necessarily final.	Defending/Explanation
are probably better yep.	Collaborative Completion
doesn't don't don't the important people have those little blue vaios that	Yes-No-question
i wonder about the cause and effect there.	Statement
and so you paused for a second.	Statement
if we saw that making a small change like you know a tenth to the self loop had a huge effect can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff?	Rising Tone
and uh then when one of those finished you'd fire off another one.	Expansions of y/n Answers
some small vocabulary tasks.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's good to good to have these things all scheduled.	Humorous Material
that won't be good.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it's the recursion.	Statement
well it's it's a linear transformation that	Statement
and so is approaching.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and so that's the belief net that we've laid out.	Statement
we're not recording yet are we?	Understanding Check
well the way it's phrased right now it's clearly asking about language.	Statement
yeah i'm particularly sensitive to this because a good friend of mine in in seattle was named scott smith and there were fourteen of them in at boeing.	Defending/Explanation
oh i think that my understanding from	Floor Grabber
so it's basically a whole bunch of words which they can really do because of the continuity within that person's turn.	Defending/Explanation
so the way this is handled is by what's called a mixture of experts.	Rising Tone
what about just doing the the sort of the steve suggestion uh as as an add on to it?	Open-Question
you you happy?	Declarative-Question
so it's somewhere in that range.	Understanding Check
anyway so let me suggest you do something else.	Action-directive
no but i think just to be consistent we should also i mean have the same conventions just in case you want	Reject
it's just that ambiguous.	Defending/Explanation
especially when reviewers read it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but the log probabilities	Statement
so i want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking uh forty five minutes.	Defending/Explanation
so the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things.	Statement
k c m file formats.	Self-talk
i thought that was.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
actually the best system that we still have is uh our system but with their noise compensation scheme.	Understanding Check
it's something you wanted to indicate that it that i this was the end of the phrase.	Defending/Explanation
it wouldn't be hard at all.	Assessment/Appreciation
and it's not due until like may fifteenth.	Expansions of y/n Answers
does it take	Yes-No-question
doesn't need to reflect everything.	Understanding Check
but because i'm not actually touching the data.	Defending/Explanation
then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet.	Statement
and they are going to be using up a lot of disk.	Statement
uh shall i start from	Yes-No-question
i mean i i can't imagine us doing it ourselves.	Defending/Explanation
um so then next thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath.	Floor Holder
which happen to correspond to intermediate categories.	Expansions of y/n Answers
want to view that	Collaborative Completion
even if it's sort of not full bore what i'm going to do for my thesis.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i would tend to leave that spontaneous.	Statement
leak their secrets?	Collaborative Completion
or did they mean a like a person?	Or-Clause
but something like that.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but um i think that way we'll cut into people's time um if someone's on strict time uh less.	Floor Holder
i wonder if it it might be possible to uh simulate the back end with some other system.	Offer
yeah you should talk with him.	Offer
and i would go out and do my daily business.	Statement
to be okay.	Collaborative Completion
but but i i i think in the short run	Reject-part
seemed really fast.	Assessment/Appreciation
so this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker.	Statement
because the last frame doesn't have any latency.	Defending/Explanation
now it's at least six times yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
now is that the long training set there?	Rising Tone
but you're adding in fact some degradation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then i laugh at for the next like twenty minutes.	Defending/Explanation
it's just a matter of a very clear	Defending/Explanation
because they're distributing it through the l.d.c.	Defending/Explanation
but i wonder if uh is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that um we would uh have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case?	Offer
so you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually?	Understanding Check
yeah so they have a lot of different conditions that they're going to be filling out.	Floor Holder
what what did you find easiest or more most difficult about transcribing the data?	Wh-Question
probably does.	Statement
um so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus wiener filtering.	Floor Holder
yeah dragging is really efficient.	Accept
yeah there's a meeting next next week i think.	Accept
haven't been awfully precise about that.	Statement
i mean liz suggested that value based on the distribution of pause times that you see in switchboard and and other corpora.	Expansions of y/n Answers
okay so let's uh	Acknowledge-answer
yeah i've i uh it's not that i didn't try.	Floor Grabber
because i know that um you can uh	Defending/Explanation
so that we create a new set of short models that don't include those speakers.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because i think it will be really difficult to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it.	Defending/Explanation
he has such a nice voice.	Statement
no it's just a straightforward h m m.	Negative Non-no Answers
i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea.	Statement
digits are nice and well behaved.	Assessment/Appreciation
so that is the training meeting.	Understanding Check
and uh so i want to um i want to start by in the next couple weeks just doing the speech group.	Floor Holder
exchange money is an errand.	Understanding Check
that's like three times three times as much disk space.	3rd-party-talk
we could just plot plot these for a speaker.	Offer
um it was a poster?	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and it saves it in a	Collaborative Completion
right the door slam phone.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah that's that's why i only used the part from.	Floor Grabber
well if i only use six seconds it still works pretty well.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
now that's a strange	Assessment/Appreciation
robustness meeting?	Understanding Check
so it'd have to be sort of a causal uh version of that.	Offer
in june.	Acknowledge-answer
so i so i guess the the question i was trying to get at with those experiments is does it matter what models you use.	Statement
the twentieth!	Acknowledge-answer
same result pretty much.	Acknowledge-answer
and it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interview or something like that then it's useful to know that that relationship.	Expansions of y/n Answers
status?	Understanding Check
so uh we we looked at the current pattern matching thing.	Floor Grabber
and if it's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations um you know we should be able to get a lot more experiments done.	Defending/Explanation
um i guess what will happen	Floor Holder
making some decisions.	Collaborative Completion
so people are really flexible.	Reformulate/Summarize
well you do.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah they'll be joking around.	Floor Grabber
so our initial plan for icsi was to do forty hours.	Statement
or is that all right?	Or-Clause
entertainment is a good one in there i think.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah maybe you just put in some other noise.	Floor Grabber
and and that's why we have found that it it does help.	Statement
yeah there's i i think there are some meetings where it would would it's possible like this.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah and henry higgins could say which block you were from.	Floor Grabber
so it has a uh nice useful tcl t.k. user interface.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh uhhuh.	Continuer
so that was part of the spell check or was that that was after the spell check?	Or-Question
um if you get a probability from that information.	Floor Holder
do you remember that signif program that we used to use for testing	Yes-No-question
that's right that's right.	Accept
uh except in	Dispreferred Answers
it might be you know that the summary would would not even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact.	Defending/Explanation
and that's what uh we've already observed.	Rising Tone
and so if we're short on digits i can just you know capture people in the hallway.	Offer
so we could say that the probabilities are you know probability of being e is one over four because one person voted for e out of four.	Rising Tone
well i mean you get the g.r. from groups i guess.	Statement
so there's fifty gigs just for our corpus.	Statement
right but i mean what's the what does the last row mean?	Acknowledge-answer
well and you know i think that that's sort of the feeling you would get if unless you looked at the data at this level.	Statement
oh but he is.	Dispreferred Answers
i just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there.	Statement
and that there is some d c offset in the italian.	Statement
i haven't read the	Defending/Explanation
you probably wouldn't ordinarily though.	Understanding Check
oh that's totally cool.	Assessment/Appreciation
barriers!	Exclamation
so what i don't have with it so far is it doesn't play wavefiles.	Statement
because it's only an approximation.	Defending/Explanation
because they're doing l d a rasta?	Understanding Check
it has the same potential for error as everything else.	Defending/Explanation
no you didn't.	Acknowledge-answer
do you know him?	Rising Tone
that's enough.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
a lot of	Collaborative Completion
the the uh traveler is that.	Rising Tone
or is it that they have several people doing it together?	Rising Tone
i mean if you knew looked back at it.	Statement
there was a difference in the amount of money awarded from the beginning to	Statement
well but but again the timing is for should be for free.	Statement
well i just think	Floor Grabber
um because we're going to be using the just the male uh model.	Defending/Explanation
i'm i'm not kidding.	Statement
so what i should do is just print out a whole stack and leave them up here.	Statement
in order to get some realistic users.	Defending/Explanation
but but but it's going to depend on who's	Reject-part
they're still working out the date.	Statement
n.s.a.	Statement
right mixed.	Acknowledge-answer
uh a little bit about	Declarative-Question
just never mind comparison with something else.	Action-directive
um i'm trying to	Statement
yeah essentially it's it's uh you know p.l.p. or or mel cepstrum or something like that.	Statement
which normally would be an acronym.	Statement
that's why there's so many insertion errors.	Understanding Check
ideally it would be nice to have like a spaniard transcribing the	Expansions of y/n Answers
the frequency domain.	Collaborative Completion
label it.	Collaborative Completion
so pauses are always an opportunity for	Expansions of y/n Answers
we're out of mikes.	Statement
and then says here it's either yep yay a or nay.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um actually is this the the right way to have it?	Rising Tone
do you know what no what no mitigation means here?	Yes-No-question
maybe we maybe we shouldn't ask it.	Offer
you know to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult.	Statement
but they were there.	Rising Tone
another option is it'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary.	Statement
oh is that what you're talking about?	Yes-No-question
i well okay i it might help	Acknowledge-answer
um whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at um arbitrary windows in time um of varying length um and cluster those.	Floor Holder
no one wants to do that.	Defending/Explanation
so that at the moment the idea we're running with is is putting the beep over it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and you think to yourself you were way off.	Statement
okay i'll start.	Commit
so let's think about this this question of how do we want to handle	Action-directive
i i just just have the final number here.	Defending/Explanation
but for the the visual just you know i'd like to have uh uh you know the spectrogram again.	Action-directive
and then he just selects the uh thing.	Statement
the uh that you know if we feel there's other measurements we don't have that we'd like to have we can make them.	Offer
no it's really okay.	Reject
oh then it comes on.	Acknowledge-answer
couldn't he?	Tag-Question
because there'll be one form for each person.	Defending/Explanation
why don't you start with that?	Action-directive
i'm going to report that to him.	Commit
yeah the one you showed yesterday.	Accept
uh but next were switchboard and callhome.	Floor Holder
so if i did it like tomorrow that would be all right it sounds like.	Offer
well for cyber transcriber they don't quote a price.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
yeah it's on i already added that one on my board to do that.	Accept
yeah it could.	Floor Grabber
l.d.a. filters.	Mimic Other
so and and um	Floor Holder
do you assume the noise is the same?	Rising Tone
and i'm like floating it to zeros right now.	Statement
do you mean do you mean eliciting particular constructions?	Rising Tone
and they shrug their shoulders and say oh it works.	Statement
so when i find that i i note note it as you know finishing.	Statement
gothic churches versus baroque townhouses versus	Statement
because they're this quantity that looks kind of gaussian when you take it's log.	Defending/Explanation
but someone told me that in fact because is treated differently in um in this context.	Statement
for moment you use we use phonetic targets.	Rising Tone
for instance that morgan uh accounted for fifty six percent of the robustness meetings in terms of number of words.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the p.c.p.c. keyboard.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah i don't know how you would do it though.	Floor Grabber
uh i wanted to take a look at um things that i could model within word.	Commit
i think i i think um you know the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the the boundaries and all that for all the channels.	Statement
but we don't care about the timing of the words.	Negative Non-no Answers
oh yeah that's okay.	Acknowledge-answer
all through friday would be fine.	Statement
where they have	Collaborative Completion
there's an agenda?	Understanding Check
that will have to be transcribed with little uh symbols.	Statement
and you've got uh the probability of the finer uh categories on the other side.	Statement
well but what i mean is that um	Defending/Explanation
it was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um so i i suppose someone could try to put a hack like that into the	Offer
they're very fast.	Negative Non-no Answers
yeah but i it's uh i think you were talking about the other mail that used v a d on the reference features.	Acknowledge-answer
just because um then we know for sure.	Defending/Explanation
yeah they were they said they were going to record	Accept
then then they will read uh a task where lots of german words are sort of thrown in between.	Statement
the l d a?	Understanding Check
boy if i wanted to increase my income i could start doing the transcribing again.	Humorous Material
um some of the backchannel stuff jane had some comments.	Statement
and another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for let's say for speechdat car.	Floor Holder
and so forth?	Declarative-Question
it's too hard without.	Assessment/Appreciation
that's a very good point.	Assessment/Appreciation
but basically for anything where you're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting um it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize.	Statement
yeah well if we had infinite processing power and data i guess using the waveform could	Floor Grabber
because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech.	Defending/Explanation
the the the the period the the the length of the window to to normalize uh the energy is uh in the context of the overlapping zone?	Understanding Check
but how much how valuable	Wh-Question
you know and but and then often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say.	Follow Me
i noticed that chuck was wearing the lapel a lot.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
oh we have.	Acknowledge-answer
right thanks.	Acknowledge-answer
uh but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with.	Defending/Explanation
so you just have to let us know.	Statement
because it does have to keep track of you	Defending/Explanation
well and we also discussed the idea of having the separate d t d's would handle maybe specific meeting specific things that might be relevant.	Statement
and let's say that after that minute boundary um b is still speaking and a overlaps with b.	Statement
what i meant was you had something like cepstra or something right?	Understanding Check
okay so so i think i mean this is something to to experimentally determine.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so i mean i i think it there's be sort of a benefit with very minimal input.	Floor Holder
and it can be edited after the fact.	Understanding Check
because then you can get this f. zero floor for each of the speakers.	Defending/Explanation
the number x. .	Collaborative Completion
you know things.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then down here you have the soundwave.	Understanding Check
yeah so it hurts a little bit on the well match.	Floor Holder
but just has another pronunciation.	Statement
but now when you throw in the reverberation it's even worse.	Statement
so i'm waiting to hear from him.	Statement
that's that's sort of part of that's not a destination reason that's sort of en passant right.	Statement
right so that	Acknowledge-answer
but i'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda.	Offer
it's very difficult if you try while you're trying say to convince somebody on the phone it's difficult not to move your hands.	Rising Tone
well there were fewer women too.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and the these um transition networks uh will be what the action planner interprets in a sense.	Statement
actually we observed we listened to some of the utterances and sometimes for finnish there is music in the recordings and strange things.	Statement
we should try to	Offer
so you you so you said one thing i want to jump on for a second.	Statement
or well what they call trap or generalized trap.	Statement
yeah that happens a lot.	Accept
makes perfect sense.	Assessment/Appreciation
should we do it a second time with pseudo	Yes-No-question

do you have uh did you find any	Yes-No-question
well i mean i'm i'm leaving for for the uh the new orleans meeting uh next saturday.	Statement
um i also recently wrote a script um that uh generates the kappa statistic.	Rising Tone
probably something that we specified in m three l.	Statement
and so the sort of question is do you want to average all the data together or do you do you	Or-Question
the cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial.	Assessment/Appreciation
but maybe in practice it is.	Statement
because our	Defending/Explanation
as using just the cepstrum?	Understanding Check
i finally remembered to put uh put native language on the newer forms.	Statement
why two each?	Wh-Question
maybe it's something that could fit easier in in our context than in a general meeting context.	Offer
sorry i'm just i'm just going to sleep.	Apology

and depending on how you construct the problem.	Statement
and that violates our privacy.	Negative Non-no Answers
yeah i mean it's probably not worth your time.	Floor Grabber
i said i think it works magnificently.	Dispreferred Answers
but what about the testing data?	Wh-Question
well fair enough.	Acknowledge-answer
uh but i i think that the uh we can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up.	Floor Holder
um the v a d is sort of in in parallel.	Floor Holder
than what it would be now.	Expansions of y/n Answers

you've	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i had something that i could bring up.	Offer
okay well not a big deal then.	Acknowledge-answer
so so um when you you did some t i digits experiments training on macrophone.	Statement
um mostly because they were doing much lower level time.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
um by the way there is another uh suggestion that would apply uh to the second configuration.	Floor Holder
so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down.	Defending/Explanation
and then you can re optimize and so on.	Offer
you were looking at festival.	Statement

some sort of slope.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh ask them what it costs.	Offer

i'm glad you brought that up.	Statement
the stressed stressed words.	Statement
so if it's only like in in the in the film and t v thing	Statement
they don't work for me very well.	Assessment/Appreciation
but rather than them coming up and telling me i figured we should just wait a week and they can tell both you know all of us.	Statement

so why don't you explain it quickly?	Action-directive
or some other smoothing?	Or-Clause
and i don't know how much this can be discussed or not.	Other Answers
because their intonation is totally different.	Defending/Explanation
that way you can get started asking joe quickly while he's while he's maybe still you know putting in nails and screws and to it.	Defending/Explanation
it's it sounds like it's you know stand alone.	Rising Tone
because there's this other thing the there's this other thing in in the tourist domain which is going to be a route planner.	Statement
the idea of being able to walk into their office and say oh can i borrow your machine for a while is is is a non starter.	Defending/Explanation
that would make that would make some sense.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i mean um you know in in j. rasta we were essentially adding in uh white uh white noise dependent on our estimate of the noise.	Statement
at	Collaborative Completion
i guess the point was to try again to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the u.i. stuff.	Statement
let's look at it anyway.	Action-directive
what about doing it with just the single channels?	Wh-Question
uh um so if they go i'll go r. e.h. huh m. m. .	Expansions of y/n Answers

usually less than point five percent.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah i mean i think the formats would be similar.	Acknowledge-answer
but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds?	Wh-Question
because it's because uh	Defending/Explanation
at one point in time or uh twenty over twenty milliseconds or something you have a spectrum or a cepstrum.	Statement
so so the the point is that if you if we try from the get go to do it off the p.z.m. we won't get anything.	Floor Grabber
how about yeah how about post p h d researcher or something?	Or-Question
every frame that's over what threshold?	Declarative-Question
is that using in combination with something else?	Rising Tone
five percent of time or five percent of what?	Understanding Check
so when you used original the original models and you just process the test set in this way do you get any do you get decent performance or not?	Or-Question
yeah and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors.	Floor Grabber
if you were going to have a short time for	Expansions of y/n Answers

um and so the question is does anyone care?	Rhetorical-Question
uh uh do did you have a look at at the uh meeting digits if they have a d c component?	Yes-No-question

because it has a reject model for you know mismatched speech essentially.	Defending/Explanation
i don't i can't explain that.	Other Answers
we we we were going to use the same tool.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

and what were you just describing?	Rising Tone
uh okay so the one one place where it looks like we're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched italian.	Floor Grabber
i mean because from a discourse purpose it's it's more it's more useful to be able to see	Defending/Explanation

they might lie anyway.	Statement
although you you know you haven't tested it actually on the german and danish.	Dispreferred Answers
is there another backed up disk that you know of that would	Yes-No-question

you know anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap.	Statement
actually i think this thing is really cutting the blood flow.	Statement

yeah i wasn't thinking of that one in particular.	Acknowledge-answer
battery.	3rd-party-talk
in fact it's good.	Assessment/Appreciation
fine that's all right that's okay.	Humorous Material
but uh you can also	Topic Change
it's similar.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and and then collapse it.	Collaborative Completion
but is it still true that basically the speaker adaptation um sort of negates much of the advantage?	Yes-No-question
and that way you'll get more variety.	Defending/Explanation
uh then does that uh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth does it does it then look much better?	Open-Question
yeah restarting the script basically.	Accept
i was going to ask you to speak up.	Repeat
so the it wasn't estimating the noise initially.	Statement
and then with over estimation of the noise depending on the uh the s n r with smoothing along time.	Rising Tone
or they just didn't they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the on position or whatever.	Maybe
fine so so	Acknowledge-answer
yeah the the way we want to do	Accept
and it seemed like they they had some new results.	Statement
is uh are the c m u folks going to be there?	Rising Tone
no no okay.	Acknowledge-answer
and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either.	Statement
and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time.	Defending/Explanation
well uh the certainly you should give it a shot first see whether you can get compatible stuff.	Floor Grabber
so you're ignoring overlapping events unless they're speech with speech.	Understanding Check
but they're not making things worse and we have reduced latency.	Understanding Check
i've forgotten someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it they could see the the waveform and oh it's going to be a seven.	Statement
is it the same directory that you had suggested?	Rising Tone
like it's difficult to say.	Other Answers
yeah i guess i'll laugh because everyone else is laughing.	Acknowledge-answer
well and not just that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so they did at least in their case it did seem to be somewhat complimentary.	Reformulate/Summarize

we called them entities.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no there's only ten.	Reject

is it a shrug?	Rising Tone
that's my opinion as well.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
you could	Maybe
okay so is are you saying?	Floor Holder
beyond what's currently being implemented which is just word lists.	Statement
for example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that how do i get to the powder tower.	Statement
then you don't have to ask the age.	Thanking

so maybe uh just briefly you could remind us about the related experiments.	Action-directive
let's call this guy y.	Statement
stress test.	Collaborative Completion
so i mean i presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here.	Understanding Check
ooo-ooo.	Mimic Other
i thought that was the one i thought that was the second row.	Statement
okay any sense about how how it does on	Acknowledge-answer
uh okay uh uh.	Acknowledge-answer
i think the idea is to train on the uh on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we're going to train to.	Statement
but is is this picture that's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry?	Yes-No-question
oh yeah i do find that the keyboard is different here than it is even at my for my school computer.	Floor Grabber
so i did that for about three different conditions.	Statement
so is it really um you know	Yes-No-question

yeah like two hundred milliseconds.	Floor Grabber
whatever that again means uh or do you does the person want to rough it?	Yes-No-question
i mean uh there's there's nothing inherent about removing if you're really removing.	Defending/Explanation
so we're not we're not concerned about getting getting about buying and or bringing in tools.	Defending/Explanation
what were you going to say?	Signal-non-understanding
none of these and no p.z.m.'s then.	Statement
because you're it's sort of like a it's not a completely automatic way of clustering.	Defending/Explanation

obviously it's not perfect.	Downplayer
it's just i haven't transcribed in in awhile.	Statement
the cepstral the difference is like there may be a slight difference in the way.	Defending/Explanation
so one eight instead of eighteen.	Defending/Explanation
then i would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say okay well i could probably reduce the errors if i included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category.	Commit

i also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed.	Rising Tone

you're going to listen to these things and	Understanding Check
that's what it should do.	Correct-misspeaking
uh could you move those up about halfway?	Floor Holder

one thing	Statement
the first you have the the spectrum of the signal.	Rising Tone
they weren't looking ahead much.	Accept-part
it's yeah it seems to be more at the end.	Accept
so it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation when you have the the manual segmentations.	Floor Grabber
that's i think what we and i agree with.	Defending/Explanation
yeah the interface was different.	Floor Grabber
but if we can try it	Statement
uh the digits task.	Acknowledge-answer
i i much prefer this.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
do you have you run across this?	Rising Tone
who who would prefer the keyboard on linguine?	Wh-Question

can i?	Rising Tone
where is eurospeech this year?	Wh-Question
how happy were they?	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

i mean you could do this with a recurrent net.	Offer
that's the bottom line.	Statement
short meetings.	Acknowledge-answer

so all the all the test sets you mean?	Understanding Check
so they mark it as a breath when it's really actually nothing.	Statement
i have a question.	Statement
yeah it was actually updated.	Accept
just to check which if there is a significant difference.	Defending/Explanation

nancy's still stick?	Understanding Check
that that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something.	Statement

but their	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
for the most part we're keeping it standard word level transcription.	Statement
like how thrifty the user is?	Understanding Check
like a second maybe.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and and that would also be that the data would be included in the database.	Offer
okay now the other example is in the glosses right there	Floor Grabber
and the last frame doesn't have any latency.	Statement
so so uh we have space on the current disk right now where meeting recorder is.	Floor Grabber
which could well mean that it occurred separately and following.	Rising Tone
so they make these decisions.	Statement
we'd have to get find their parent to sign for them.	Defending/Explanation
is there was there any experiment with	Yes-No-question

i think just just having stereo will help.	Assessment/Appreciation

like you can	Expansions of y/n Answers
have have you seen do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything?	Yes-No-question
yeah i do that too.	Accept
and that seems to be improving a lot on the speechdat-car where there is a lot of noise.	Statement
because they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff.	Defending/Explanation
or does it does the fact that there's a backchannel split the the the it in two?	Or-Clause

i guess so.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

well the hub five small training set contains as much macrophone as the large training set for historical reasons.	Statement

yeah oh well.	Acknowledge-answer
do you think that's important?	Tag-Question

and then the other thing might be um uh technical versus administrative.	Statement
yeah i'm not being i'm not being clear.	Defending/Explanation
but i guess that was more ambitious.	Defending/Explanation
like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not?	Understanding Check

so we can get that just with uh media costs.	Understanding Check
well we we need to we need to find out how much that will cost so i can pass that on to morgan.	Action-directive
so currently uh we have system that has two hundred and thirty.	Statement

have you run across that where they're they're saying?	Yes-No-question
which is musical noise.	Expansions of y/n Answers

to handle those people that call you on the phone and just like to talk and talk and talk.	Expansions of y/n Answers

just uh to get	Expansions of y/n Answers

because they might get it more right the first time.	Defending/Explanation
so that was very interesting for me.	Statement
it just uses entropy coding?	Understanding Check
so i'm not sure i'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance.	Other Answers
so when he said sign yah and it sounds like sign he was saying signal.	Statement
you did an excellent job.	Assessment/Appreciation

first of all the time marking you'd get you could get by a tool.	Defending/Explanation
because you'll get because you'll get very different answers from everybody right?	Defending/Explanation

uh when you trained on macrophone um to do those digits experiments did you use the entire macrophone corpus?	Repeat
there there is a complication though and that is if a person turns their back to the to the p d a then some of the positional information goes away.	Statement

that well that we want to do.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which is the way we decided we were going to go because a it's easier in the beginning.	Defending/Explanation
okay should we do digits?	Floor Grabber
i mean that's why that's why if you if you use dragondictate or or viavoice or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these.	Defending/Explanation
kind of like uh.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh that's what gets i i picked those up in the frequency check.	Statement
is this is this the	Yes-No-question
maybe you should limit ourselves to the meeting recorder meetings.	Reject-part
uh if we could on top of that	Offer
uh for discourse yeah yeah yeah.	Accept
you know part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there's something you know say in six to ten kilohertz that you might use for for some purposes somewhere.	Rising Tone
well and i think that	Floor Grabber
oh god	Assessment/Appreciation
um we know basically what the topic is what the possibilities are and and we've spoken with each other.	Defending/Explanation
or or a	Statement

that's the only other one.	Statement
it depends on what you're after of course.	Reject-part
no i guess the v a d has its own set of features.	Reject
you know what we could do also is have more than one version of release.	Offer

those are two different to's.	Statement
it was never up to like a native speaker.	Rising Tone
yep huh.	Acknowledge-answer
they're doing l d a rasta.	Repeat

now there are two ways one can go imagine doing that.	Statement

i i guess i should probably look at these others a little bit.	Commit
right of it.	Collaborative Completion
i'll be peeking.	Humorous Material
you didn't do that okay.	Acknowledge-answer
so will it be in our case where we're using the neural net?	Open-Question
yeah sometimes they they usually put them in parentheses.	Floor Grabber
okay let's be done with this.	Acknowledge-answer
is it is it the c.m. u?	Yes-No-question
uh so okay it sounds like uh there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about.	Floor Holder

yeah the you sure?	Declarative-Question
good i i that was my impression also.	Acknowledge-answer
it'll tell you the hit but not the query.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
one of the items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non local.	Offer
the it seems like the computer science people use lipsmack for that.	Rising Tone
sounds like a great idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
oh true enough.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so they must be giving the pre-segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt.	Defending/Explanation
how do you spell that?	Wh-Question

yeah i also thought of there there are really some channels where it is almost um only breathing in it.	Acknowledge-answer
um how well do they stand up over the	Wh-Question

yeah if not given we will estimate.	Accept
it's kind of uh	Statement

you know what is the what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate kind of thing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah because you have this a a s r u deadline.	Acknowledge-answer
um let's see that one.	Floor Holder
and people read through them.	Defending/Explanation
even though they're not several feet apart.	Expansions of y/n Answers
a lot of overlapping yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so you have one minimum for each frequency?	Declarative-Question
forget it.	Offer
for bigger meetings.	Expansions of y/n Answers
they're not going to provide repairs.	Defending/Explanation
they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields right?	Understanding Check
gives some good clues.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so um all of that is is uh still seems like a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
so that that the go there decision will have a node from uh discourse.	Statement
well it's one possibility.	Assessment/Appreciation
so we and you have the short you have short training results for the close case?	Understanding Check
i had to install it yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i am pretty sure they do.	Statement
so if someone said uhhuh in the middle of a of someone's uh uh intonational contour i i indicated it as like what you just did.	Defending/Explanation
something that's different.	Expansions of y/n Answers

so will you talk to him about that?	Rising Tone
not that i know of actually.	Reject
could	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
are you guys free at five?	Rising Tone
so what's the significance of november fifteenth?	Rising Tone
so i guess the way it would work is that you'd get	Statement
if they have something really smart in mind you know maybe we can use it.	Offer
yeah all i meant is that if you're asking the question from the point of view of what's different about a meeting studying meetings of say more than two people versus what kinds of questions you could ask with a two person meeting.	Floor Grabber
or when you expect them to finish it or	Open-Question
yeah yeah i mean because we we have we have uh uh half the the uh data rate that they allow.	Accept
to separate the ears?	Collaborative Completion
and put all the files where they really belong on one disk.	Offer
no but it's easy enough to do.	Reject
h t m l?	Understanding Check
and so uh i was using the broadcast news nets on this data.	Floor Holder
no i wish.	Reject
yeah leave it out.	Offer
but i forgot to print any out.	Statement
or is that really just a guess?	Or-Clause
so it's it's um pretty broad based.	Statement
if we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it's not longer useful for discourse.	Statement
very good question.	Assessment/Appreciation
because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram.	Defending/Explanation
this histogram method.	Expansions of y/n Answers
if it's if it's voiced include it.	Offer
and the non vocal ones are like door-slams and tappings.	Statement

like say for example the mean of the energy.	Expansions of y/n Answers

i i didn't think of of of this before.	Statement
get a much better estimate and subtract it off.	Offer
just any in in each in each frame	Rising Tone
i mean they're going to say speaker one or speaker two or i mean i i	Understanding Check

that would be a meeting meeting meeting?	Declarative-Question
it does seem like you know some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
s.	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
no nobody's told me anything.	Reject
and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there.	Offer
yeah so um a better way would be something more more data driven.	Offer
and then average these minima and take this as an an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band.	Rising Tone
i'm sorry but you're alphabetical that's why i'm choosing you.	Apology
something like one per frequency band.	Rising Tone

i mean is this realistic?	Rising Tone
i think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in.	Rising Tone
but actually um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well matched case.	Rising Tone
well i mean if if	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
and one of the things you could do is you could do some sort of v a d like thing.	Offer
that's causing problems.	Collaborative Completion
shall we do digits?	Rising Tone

no he'll be around for three weeks.	Statement
i mean if we had about six a six hour test set's not bad.	Assessment/Appreciation
but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that that variability and you know doing something reasonable with it.	Defending/Explanation
one of these perhaps?	Declarative-Question
and so we redesigned two filters.	Statement
and then the second guy in the overlap.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but i think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework.	Statement
well we could just put blindfolds on.	Floor Grabber
where uh you have all the training uh conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also.	Expansions of y/n Answers
okay so the question is is would some kind of normalization help?	Acknowledge-answer
so it's not really you're not really exposed to german very much.	Understanding Check
you can look at stress.	Offer

and the end of a discourse marker.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so what's it start on?	Wh-Question

you know it it's it's relative to what you're focus was on that meeting.	Defending/Explanation
um yeah but it's all in the in the lexicon.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
you'll see it you'll see something comes up immediately that the reason i want to do this.	Defending/Explanation
for i i think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition.	Offer
uh do we want to get going beyond more which is sort of the	Yes-No-question
we're going to have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that.	Statement
should i pursue that?	Rising Tone
that's it's good to be careful about the mousing.	Statement
so i think the thing is since we're not evidently throwing away useful information let's try to put in some useful information.	Offer
t i digits are very clean recorded digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
when is the uh santa barbara	Wh-Question
so um so there was a chunk parser in verbmobil that was one of the uh branchers.	Floor Grabber
uh so let's think about the case where a starts speaking and then b overlaps with a and then the minute boundary happens.	Offer
yeah we talked about that.	Statement
but i mean it'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data.	Assessment/Appreciation
um either i want to know where it is or not.	Rising Tone
you got it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and they'll say there's no such thing.	Humorous Material
uh putting a nonlinearity on it is you know not that big a deal.	Floor Holder

are they really quals?	Rising Tone

you can also look at just the voiced regions later.	Offer
okay anyways.	Floor Holder

that's supposed to be point six for the self loop.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
more similar than to so i think.	Other Answers
so it's not not that representative.	Statement
we're writing out these individual segments that wherever there's a time boundary from thilo or or jane's transcribers you know we we chop it there.	Statement

there're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this.	Rising Tone

it's a forty forty plus minute meeting.	Statement

maybe we know them.	Maybe
you augment these diagrams like this.	Statement

no what i meant was that i would hope that for meetings in english you would have native speakers transcribing it.	Floor Grabber
because we're basically duplicating the originals um	Statement
i'll do it.	Commit
anyway i thought okay maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he'd be starting in january next semester that we'd have you know enough data to work with.	Floor Holder
okay we can record but no one can look at each other.	Action-directive
we're not very good.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah where you were sitting probably affected it.	Floor Grabber
uh i was just going to say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity or speech-nonspeech rather um by looking at um you know uh i guess harmonics	Rising Tone

glad to hear it.	Assessment/Appreciation

what was he saying?	Wh-Question

so-and-so and so	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
for for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do.	Accept-part
if you launch twenty jobs they are all running.	Expansions of y/n Answers

i mean do	Statement
it's uh it's like a medium medium mismatch condition sort of.	Statement

uh the bug.	Acknowledge-answer
you've already you've already done some?	Declarative-Question
it's i think the last page.	Statement
where should i start?	Self-talk
so they want to be as similar as possible.	Defending/Explanation
down near the bottom of this sheet.	Statement
because then it would cut off the p z m's from having the indirect.	Defending/Explanation
or someone could in in in new york and have i mean any number of different types of speech patterns.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so it does a very fuzzy sort of match.	Statement
the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the s r i are more s r i system are more complex.	Rising Tone
or sort of a mock this or mock that.	Statement
okay well but then there's this issue of if we're going to use this for a discourse type of thing then and you know liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who's who's the addressee and all then to have roger be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was roger be frank that's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis.

so what i i just do is to put uh to to add to put the threshold first and then to add a small amount of noise.	Statement
and you want to ask questions to get more detail.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and you know.	Floor Holder
that you're doing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i think we could use it for other things around here too.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it's something that when you move your hand further the sound goes faster past it.	Defending/Explanation
and that was that um if you have uh feed two streams into h t k um and you uh change the uh variances	Statement
um we need to finish the	Floor Holder
low fidelity.	Collaborative Completion
and then use a tandem system.	Rising Tone
but is that the kind of thing	Rising Tone
yeah like a a skull and crossbones.	Floor Grabber
like sometimes hhh is a laugh.	Defending/Explanation
yeah we should talk to you off line about something.	Accept
it's it's is is it clear what he wants to compute?	Rising Tone
yeah so i i think uh you guys are closer to it than me so correct me if i'm wrong but i i think that what's going on is that in in both cases some kind of normalization is done to deal with convolutional effects.	Statement
i don't know if i did one.	3rd-party-talk
but that's that's what we do with our systems.	Defending/Explanation

yeah it's really an odd task in in a way.	Floor Grabber
i mean the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it's good.	Defending/Explanation

okay so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good.	Offer
you know the methodology.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i think the p.c. revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself.	Defending/Explanation
for this exact task?	Declarative-Question
that's so that's why the n s a ones have still not been approved though.	Defending/Explanation
then build intermediate category classifiers then do recognition.	Statement
in any case i could re train short models within a few hours actually at if i use machines at s r i.	Statement
is kind of how i see it.	Defending/Explanation
so should we keep the same i think we might try to keep the same idea.	Offer
the other thing i could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything to my eighteen gig disk which is local.	Offer
yeah that's why i was wondering.	Accept
and if the lower bound is nine x. then it's a waste of time.	Defending/Explanation

i'm not i'm not sure what they're going to do.	Other Answers
send it to them.	Collaborative Completion
i thought i thought it was read.	Defending/Explanation
and saying oh listen to her.	Humorous Material
but the issue is you definitely want to make sure that the kind of group you're getting is the right group.	Offer
um what i was asking though is uh are what's what's the level of communication with uh the o g i gang now about this?	Floor Holder
well what the so the reason we're doing near field as well is if that doesn't work we want to we want some something that will work.	Defending/Explanation
but especially if it looks like the potential is there.	Floor Holder
all sorts of interesting things you can do with that.	Offer
uh yeah we should let him finish what he he was going to say.	Acknowledge-answer
i think it's funny when there's little side conversations like that that happen at the same time too.	Statement
but but it seemed like they got pretty good results on their meeting data.	Defending/Explanation
we could have like you know some periodic meetings.	Offer
they're such major sources of variance that it's it's it's uh	Statement
so what is the sort of how tight are they?	Wh-Question
who does?	Wh-Question
yeah because we have to get started.	Floor Grabber
and um i'm just going to see if if that that better models um uh asynchrony in any way.	Floor Holder
yeah since we want to possibly synchronize these things as well.	Topic Change
uh i mean the ultimate fall back that we could do	Statement
i didn't do this before and i regret it.	Statement
i have i had better start changing all my slides.	Statement
i don't think we should have rules of participation.	Statement
yeah well you're i think you're the first one here to work with v t s.	Acknowledge-answer
why not the full aurora uh test?	Rising Tone
because that if	Defending/Explanation
oh johno does a lot of that.	Statement
tell them about the free lunch.	Action-directive
and the effect of training on something that's viterbi aligned instead of hand hand labeled.	Defending/Explanation
it's another approach.	Statement
well well try this one on.	Action-directive
less so.	Collaborative Completion
but then i had some other uh discussions with him.	Statement
uh we were just you know storing	Floor Holder
and at that time i said you know we said don't worry about the the compute power.	Statement
and then anything	Statement
or turn up	Collaborative Completion
oh okay so	Acknowledge-answer
so we might want to restrict it to maybe a few meetings.	Offer
oh much better.	Assessment/Appreciation
so you can save this one as and open up the old one.	Offer
no i spoke with jane about that.	Accept
so um so actually the answer for experiments with one is that adding m s g if you uh does not help in that case	Floor Holder
i mean it's really weird.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah i put in the x. s.	Floor Grabber
i could re check that.	Rising Tone
and uh and what do we freeze.	Floor Holder
um if you go to spontaneous speech then it's it's trickier.	Floor Holder
i mean some cases there're some people um who who have very long segments of discourse where you know they'll they'll breath and then i put a break.	Statement
so it's it's a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
but we don't need to be really really specific about the others because it won't be very helpful anyway.	Accept-part
where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied?	Wh-Question
were you including the the lapel in this?	Rising Tone
yeah but i don't actually remember what it was.	Acknowledge-answer
i have a question about this.	Statement
but that will depend on what the meeting's about.	Defending/Explanation
these same people?	Declarative-Question
but you could using this um basis function idea you could have some basis functions.	Statement
are you looking at one in in particular of these two?	Rising Tone
i mean why would you do it if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing?	Wh-Question
uh fff	Floor Holder
there didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal?	Understanding Check
what a good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
so i don't i don't know.	Other Answers
we trained these things up on the on the the final label.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and this is where things are going to get very messy.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because the acoustics of it it just fits into the a hearer's range.	Defending/Explanation
right you don't want to do that.	Accept
and and the uh transcribers will have fun with that.	Humorous Material
so if you don't have that information how are you going to do anything?	Rhetorical-Question
and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps.	Commit
yeah i'm just saying that for the recording.	Acknowledge-answer
and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation.	Assessment/Appreciation
but uh how was the stream combined?	Wh-Question
what's what are the two different meanings there?	Wh-Question
because i mean you have a bunch of different types of accents in new york.	Defending/Explanation
you know build a template that uh somehow would capture the fact that he wants to take a picture.	Statement
it's it's really interesting also.	Assessment/Appreciation
or uh young or old.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the smoothing.	Collaborative Completion
actually that's a that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating.	Statement
so uh let's let's let's let's do our let's do our digits.	Action-directive
yeah well could be things like if x two and x three say yes then ignore x one also.	Acknowledge-answer
well it's slightly different so i i would say it would be a good idea.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so um it's true that we want to be selective in some ways uh the way that you were speaking about with uh not having an interlingua and uh these other issues.	Floor Holder
did you guys ever	Yes-No-question
but but our focus is basically to develop the algorithms to push the state of the art on this transcription task.	Defending/Explanation
because that's what he cares about.	Defending/Explanation
and then maybe one far field.	Offer
and and the data.	Expansions of y/n Answers
to adapt the speech recognition.	Defending/Explanation
you do the last line i'll do the first line.	Action-directive
really easy.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's neat.	Assessment/Appreciation
well that's not good right?	Negative Non-no Answers
because that's very easy for a person to fill out.	Defending/Explanation
and the other things people can write whatever they want.	Offer
yeah i was wondering about that.	Accept
so it'll have to be convention.	Statement
yeah there's an overlapping mark.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah basically what his software does is it picks out keywords and does a google-like search.	Floor Holder
with uh the	Expansions of y/n Answers
well see i i do a previous filtering before i give the tigerfish ones out.	Statement
is there a lot?	Rising Tone
i mean there's nothing to say that the the processing for this re synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original according to some equation.	Statement
you know one from one one from the other and then you know you can look and see how different the numbers are.	Humorous Material
i suspect you haven't.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
oh that'd be interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
they're they're in a different situation because they're doing video.	Rising Tone
what do you look at in order to normalize?	Wh-Question
did you also?	Rising Tone
and so i'm interested in in well interested in looking at prosody.	Statement
because it's sort of meant for recognition.	Defending/Explanation
well maybe that's the best way to go.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but it's pretty rough.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we've we've thought about doing that.	Statement
because all our nets are trained on the same noises.	Defending/Explanation
so a key thing will be that you we tell you.	Humorous Material
so do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average?	Rising Tone
but the segmentations matter for the filtering.	Understanding Check
it's really the the interface is wonderful.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean since wiener filter also assumes that you're that you're adding together the two signals how is how is that differ from signal subspace?	Wh-Question
when you're somewhere else.	Expansions of y/n Answers
this is the channeltrans.	Understanding Check
um it helps a lot over the the baseline.	Floor Holder
if you use both sides and the two layer and all that.	Defending/Explanation
and uh that says to me yes that you know there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we're adding in or something like that.	Floor Holder
they do a first pass speech recognition.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us.	Statement
i haven't run across that often.	Defending/Explanation
um not a not a bad intrusion.	Expansions of y/n Answers
first order effects.	Collaborative Completion
in terms of what it is that you like particularly and what you don't.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um well i don't think we're um completely off the wall.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
um i think tony robinson used to do i was saying this before i think he used to do mel uh spectra and mel cepstra.	Floor Holder
especially since this is common knowledge.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but a lot and then compared to the number parameters.	Defending/Explanation
could i hear you next?	Action-directive
maybe we could have like a like a half hour then take a little break.	Offer
yeah yeah i mean it's really cool.	Accept
no we don't care about that at all.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and so why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes?	Offer
and that took only i think it took only two days.	Defending/Explanation
yeah so the the reason yeah the reason is that perhaps the target the task dependency the language dependency and the noise dependency	Floor Grabber
so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um uh but	Floor Holder
just nothing.	Statement
who knows if they're going to be able to manage multiple channel data?	Wh-Question
of of tape?	Declarative-Question
that if we can put the	Expansions of y/n Answers
or no pre pre emphasis filter.	Offer
i mean that's not a big deal.	Downplayer
did he mean face like face to face?	Rising Tone
in much the same way as how how you know should the route be?	Rhetorical-Question
maybe a user	Statement
and and people don't it won't interfere with their regular work.	Defending/Explanation
um a male system and a female system	Floor Holder
but uh if if we feel that we need to probably still doing some recordings for smartkom or something.	Offer
summary of experiments since well since last week.	Rising Tone
we have about two hours worth.	Statement
so what they do is they identify who's the dominant speaker and when the speaker starts.	Statement
um i thought that was very interesting.	Floor Holder
uh i guess they argued about that yesterday.	Statement
yeah that skips	Floor Grabber
where are we going to get data?	Defending/Explanation
you know and then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant.	Follow Me
i mean what i was going to say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names.	Offer
oop!	Exclamation
so so the function of the thing that comes out of h is very different from the function of the other inputs.	Understanding Check
same with i don't know.	Statement
i must have.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
we can't transcribe any of it now!	Exclamation
so exact same training data?	Understanding Check
just do p. make.	Collaborative Completion
uh and another thing is to	Floor Holder
where do you see that?	Rising Tone
that in fact if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones you do have some location information which we don't have with the one.	Statement
i'm i'm i'm going up and then i'm going down.	Statement
you know it it it's to your benefit to to try to get in right when you think they're done.	Defending/Explanation
linguistic anthropologists would would suggest it would be useful to also take a picture of the meeting.	Negative Non-no Answers
so so uh um	Floor Holder
can somebody explain to me why you do digits?	Yes-No-question
that and too much caffeine and really tired.	Accept
yes yes uhhuh yeah.	Continuer
i mean sounds like we probably will.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh but you know looking at it another way maybe more importantly uh we didn't have any explicit noise uh handling.	Statement
but i'm not really senior yet.	Humorous Material
and maybe we want to regroup things under different labels later	Offer
maybe you already did this experiment.	Downplayer
but i still have to to look more at this.	Defending/Explanation
that if if people have something in front of them.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when uh the testing set was quite different than what you'd trained your discriminant features for.	Floor Holder
they they govern more or less the the dialogue behavior or the action.	Understanding Check
okay we're going to get horrible performance on that.	Defending/Explanation
we have several categories that are specifically constrained.	Defending/Explanation
which um have the assumption that um you can do l p c um analysis of of the signal you get at the far microphone.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and so uh we're looking into other vendors.	Statement
um we don't really know how those should be labeled.	Floor Holder
so like one instant in time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
when when are you thinking of going up to uh o g i?	Expansions of y/n Answers
and after a while i started getting confused as to whether or not he was like just going tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk to himself.	Rising Tone
they find different things.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so you might as well just give him the summaries.	Offer
and that should be no problem.	Rising Tone
what's in the latches from the speech recognizer?	Open-Question
so uh i had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda to send it to me and no one did.	Floor Holder
um i've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services.	Floor Holder
well he's he's just actually looking at uh the confusions between sonorant and non sonorant.	Statement
edwards at	Collaborative Completion
or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things?	Or-Clause
what he has mentioned before.	Collaborative Completion
yeah i i guess it's almost ready.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
first of all this i added i knew from sort of basically this has to be there.	Statement
so if well it may be more than endpoint decisions.	Reject-part
or user compatibility.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like to connect it with what is going on elsewhere.	Expansions of y/n Answers
row row row your boat.	Rising Tone
so is it a lossless compression when you compress	Yes-No-question
but the other thing we could do is also we could	Offer
well you want to	Floor Grabber
and this requires humans just like the the s.t.p. stuff?	Declarative-Question
yeah you find little lost lost words in the middle.	Accept
i'm just thinking about how people human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this.	Statement
as i said the meeting recorder project	Statement
and uh you know not taking too much meeting time.	Rising Tone
uh the close channel?	Declarative-Question
since it's already set up for for switchboard.	Defending/Explanation
i mean i was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks.	Statement
no it's the old v.a.d.	Reject
just want to be sure there's enough data to	Defending/Explanation

i didn't quite know what to make of that.	Statement
stephane.	Collaborative Completion

drag them in here.	Offer
um and um um	Floor Holder

well actually you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different pieces of the input are.	Dispreferred Answers

um i remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non vocal sounds.	Rising Tone
the other thing is is that we might be	Offer
where you're uh uh using uh the submitted system.	Expansions of y/n Answers

that'll also lessen the standard deviation.	Statement
speech shaped?	Declarative-Question
yeah i think that i think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time.	Accept
and this thing throws you out of it i guess.	Statement
um when i when i correct it i can i can tell that the person who um transcribed it before me probably didn't speak spanish.	Rising Tone
so um i	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so when do you guys leave?	Wh-Question

it's sort of a research question you you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding uh there's this kind of structure to it.	Defending/Explanation
the i mean	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

let me make a note on yours.	Action-directive
so you want to pause briefly between each one.	Action-directive

it's the funniest thing.	Assessment/Appreciation
on top of the v a d that they provide?	Understanding Check

i meant four.	Humorous Material

imagine we're doing a couple of hours a week of transcripts.	Action-directive
so i guess if there's an overlap like if i'm saying something that's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped too?	Declarative-Question

are we dropping information that can might be useful within speech?	Yes-No-question
the note-taking	About-task
we have to reduce it by ten milliseconds somehow.	Understanding Check

uh that that might be an interesting um problem to look at.	Offer

that'd be interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah but those are bigger deal things.	Accept
because this these will help you to to track the the noise level.	Defending/Explanation
so do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future.	Floor Grabber

they they've started a table where they're showing their results on various different noise conditions.	Statement
that but	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i think i really like think of it in terms of re transcribing it almost.	Statement

it's just that they have the	Statement

i'm just the community	Statement

because of	Defending/Explanation

if if horacio wants you know wants that done maybe that'll be maybe we'll end up doing that.	Maybe

in terms of the this new procedure you're suggesting um what is the	Wh-Question

uh we'll introduce ourselves and what we do.	Rising Tone
he throws out some speakers that are that are very small.	Accept-part

because then you'll hear you'll hear part of what another person is saying and and that's all transcribed on that one level.	Defending/Explanation
and then other agents will be doing their task independently.	Understanding Check
and the cast of characters that you put up on the web was helpful.	Statement
oh good idea.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah okay great.	Continuer
it was an interesting	Assessment/Appreciation

i guess that is that is where the consensus is.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

i was trying twelve seconds because that was the best in my test before.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i'm i'm wondering about that.	Floor Grabber

yeah we never had our data format discussion.	Floor Grabber
all the way down to an individual machine.	Expansions of y/n Answers

yeah well we'd	Acknowledge-answer
we're going to need we're going to need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools and validate the tools the do the to to do all this anyway.	Defending/Explanation

can can't we buy an expander that you just	Offer

yeah so you so you	Acknowledge-answer
can i be excused?	Rising Tone

we're on.	Statement
because he does make a good point about the region.	Statement
that's another another way to go.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh under the communicator project.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time and.	Defending/Explanation
um just you can just sit here.	3rd-party-talk
but just testing on t i digits would already give us some information about what's going on.	Statement
i would not be as thorough.	Statement
you won't be able to look at it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
okay let's do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time.	Offer
uh much as i said with j rasta.	Statement
um i mean what	Floor Grabber
i i'm not sure how that works.	Other Answers
um on the other hand	Floor Holder
doesn't hurt but doesn't get a little better or something.	Understanding Check
i mean the other thing which which it might come in to is if there was some problem in the re training.	Offer
yeah he suggested a smaller capacitor.	Floor Grabber
that'd be kind of creepy.	Assessment/Appreciation
you know perhaps?	Declarative-Question
yes very true very true.	Accept
so we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system.	Commit
um it says it looks like the groupings are important.	Floor Holder
although that's that may be a misnomer.	Expansions of y/n Answers
with some some gap.	Collaborative Completion
and yet you have to check the channels for if they did backchannels or if they did other things that you need to encode that weren't on the pre segmenter.	Floor Holder
what do you mean by	Wh-Question
all ten hours?	Understanding Check
which is the uh the macrophone training.	Statement
that's kind of interesting though.	Assessment/Appreciation
so uh i i i think it's it's uh	Statement

there's another there's another word error.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

it wasn't p.l.p. because hynek hadn't invented it yet.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it would affect stuff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean jane had had comments like uh to who who the person was speaking to.	Expansions of y/n Answers
he does it a	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah okay now what i would say um	Acknowledge-answer
i mean because primarily the markings are at speaker change.	Defending/Explanation
because you've got the pre voicing before the consonant actually begins.	Defending/Explanation
shift backspace to collapse it yeah.	Statement
you can get the ground truth.	Collaborative Completion
but um i just pay attention more to the fact that every pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions.	Floor Holder
yeah one can imagine the problems that that would engender.	Accept
not one quarter.	Reject
but but but the thing is that if you um if you detect that there's periodic strong periodic components then you can use a voiced voice thing.	Defending/Explanation
research yeah.	Collaborative Completion
hey i caught one this one and it's already cooked!	Exclamation
oh okay i'll ask david then.	Acknowledge-answer
that's that's really something.	Assessment/Appreciation
oh stephane always has these great ideas.	Statement
it would be underneath that little resolution bar?	Understanding Check
and it i especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded.	Statement
or is the breathing and things	Or-Clause
we got to be convinced we understand what's going on.	Defending/Explanation
that's that's a	Statement
and this will not affect the final score almost.	Statement
and so uh there's a higher probability of it making an error uh in the first utterance.	Floor Holder
and to our listening audience.	Humorous Material
and so you need something else.	Offer
so it wouldn't be that hard to go back and	Reformulate/Summarize
um i didn't get it.	Floor Holder
which i guess i would ask carlos about that.	Statement
i have uh the result of my work during the last days.	Statement
but but just	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
yeah but this all these things i have to still try it on the t.i. digits.	Floor Grabber
but i can just take this.	Rising Tone
well we don't know for sure.	Other Answers
those aren't the kind of things that come up.	Statement
which they're not doing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i don't know how.	Other Answers
but it sounded very good.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah um so the second point is that we have no single cross language experiments uh that we did not have last week.	Floor Holder
yeah so there are with this technique there are some	Floor Grabber
and the acoustic models are like triphone models or or is it the whole word?	Or-Question
oh yes good example!	Exclamation
i personally only want text data.	Statement
so what's the schedule on these things?	Rising Tone
it's not any of the extra um you know glottal thing.	Defending/Explanation
that's hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
you'd say ten?	Understanding Check

right it's because they make people feel like television stars.	Floor Grabber
which is if that's true uh how do we want to combine those?	Or-Question

he he'll like	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
uh what is it?	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
some in some cases the clean speech is like when it's estimated it goes to very low values.	Defending/Explanation
but when you look across a bunch of these and there's some some pattern	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
um uh i think the file regards reorganization also um another issue there is disk space probably.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
well we yeah we don't have a third dimension there yeah so it's	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

yeah i mean you need actually three to the five.	Floor Grabber
yeah but that's not uh	Acknowledge-answer
i would like to get away from having only one specific grouping.	Maybe
i mean if everybody was in the universities collecting data we are you are i mean sharing the data and making a bigger corpus is going to be you know a benefit for everybody.	Statement
rather than with with a periodic source.	Understanding Check
we also had the uh uh that we were uh that you were going to get us the eight hundred number.	Topic Change
did you build any houses?	Rising Tone
it actually improves over the baseline of not having a wiener filter in the whole system.	Defending/Explanation

they meant tickle as in	Statement
if if we wanted to do that.	Defending/Explanation

wait i i'm sorry?	Signal-non-understanding
intelligent room sorts of things.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and he's he wanted to um look at um how people respond to formant changes i think.	Statement
no but certainly one of the issues is is the uh is security.	Floor Grabber
okay so the the short thing is um we have uh tape recording uh uh sorry digitized recordings.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
but we are facing of course much more um realistic problems.	Rising Tone
he and then he uses that to classify.	Statement
i guess i would say you know sometimes we've seen hmph in literature meaning	Offer

it's just a digital record.	Defending/Explanation

um these are better if they're worn correctly.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

we've got two hours of space now.	Statement

it's based on your presegmentation.	Statement
except if if it's the thirty one at midnight.	Reject-part

looking at envelope only that we'd be significantly worse than that.	Rising Tone

like those groups?	Understanding Check
okay so we read the transcript number first.	Acknowledge-answer
so for a word like because is it that it's always predictably because?	Rising Tone
uh absolutely.	Accept
how can they tell that?	Wh-Question
so that's that's put in and you know it may even end up with mel spectrum even though i'm saying i think we could do much better just because it's simple.	Statement
because he seems to be the chairman.	Defending/Explanation
and you know maybe if it's used in combination it will get at something that we're missing.	Floor Holder
um so right now i'm in in the phase where i'm looking at at um deciding on a initial set of intermediate categories.	Statement
they just they have it though.	Statement

we just use the clean f f t bins.	Statement
it just seems like that's a very different thing than what we're doing.	Negative Non-no Answers
that might be a query.	Defending/Explanation

and you don't really need the close microphone you mean.	Dispreferred Answers
because we don't want to	Defending/Explanation
yeah so having multiple people might get at some of that.	Accept
they uh that you know if you say optional then it's sort of	Statement
oh different ones?	Acknowledge-answer
and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse.	Statement
can you do special gestures and so on that that have uh special meaning to the corpora?	Expansions of y/n Answers
somewhere in between the start and the end.	Understanding Check
which are what are the two differences?	Wh-Question
uh so i don't have that number here.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
um mode.	Floor Holder
so they can charge whatever they want.	Statement
but they don't have that option.	Negative Non-no Answers
yeah when i'm clearing the parentheses i find that very useful.	Floor Grabber
so we might as well just do it.	Statement
is he going to continue with the old uh thing?	Yes-No-question
why would they treat them differently?	Understanding Check
so you have that data don't you?	Understanding Check
which would be interesting in itself.	Assessment/Appreciation
well let me ask you if if both people were over there it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across catty corner.	Understanding Check
i'll put like a	Statement
i'm at your disposal.	Statement
well um it seems that	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
well that's what the final the the third category was designed to do.	Defending/Explanation
that that's the sort of we keep you keep uh you keep updating those numbers for future utterances.	Statement
or need some other	Expansions of y/n Answers
but but yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
and it and the the five thousand for the wires.	Humorous Material
um why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out?	Offer
for the v a d yeah.	Accept
so it's that's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
you can clip click on individual utterances and it'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal and play it for you.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so if you have a strong	Statement
but um uh and um	Floor Holder
or not to be.	Humorous Material
i i i'm sorry	Floor Grabber
dan's sort of already started.	Negative Non-no Answers
but on the other hand the system doesn't have any public transport this the planner system doesn't have any public transport in it yet.	Defending/Explanation
i don't remember exactly.	Defending/Explanation
because of because of the separate channels.	Negative Non-no Answers
and at least that gives you the word that they might run a query on.	Statement
and then again if it's	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
you don't have to?	Understanding Check
so there will be a nums tag on those lines?	Understanding Check
in albany.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that's unnatural and forced.	Floor Grabber
i wonder about that though.	Maybe
well that's something i would like to investigate further.	Downplayer
well yeah now that that only occurs once.	Acknowledge-answer
and you can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing.	Defending/Explanation
when did they estimate that they would have that system available for download?	Wh-Question
can i see?	Rising Tone
or maybe if you	Offer
so next week we'll have uh both birger and uh mike michael.	Statement
but if it's moving quickly seems that it's covering more ground faster.	Rising Tone
forty two.	Statement
also?	Tag-Question
jane can i ask you a question?	Yes-No-question
uh where to plug in the the network uh after the the feature.	Statement
um what what's the plan for this discussion?	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
i mean in that's all i remember from most meetings.	Defending/Explanation
it's kind of nice.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's like a it's like a	Statement
or one million frames.	Rising Tone
so that i mean that basically there are standard solutions and we should just adopt adopt them.	Understanding Check
if we use neural network even if the features are not correctly normalized we jump to ninety per cent.	Statement
um uh status of transcription.	About-task
um this this was when it was used.	Floor Holder
well i mean if there's enough data maybe two.	Offer
yeah a little bit.	Accept
because we haven't even cut the waveforms for that.	Defending/Explanation
yeah almost.	Accept
yeah that's probably aurora.	Accept
that was really it was like transcription a meta-transcription and meta meta meta.	Assessment/Appreciation
and use the anonymized one through the transcript.	Offer
and um and that's a simple way to get started using using this.	Floor Holder
no i i plan to do that.	Statement
well it has i mean the	Statement
so it may be he needs more than me.	Humorous Material
if they're right next to one another?	Understanding Check
the reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it's it's too long in the in the time domain for the um for the rasta filtering to take care of it.	Defending/Explanation
because if you put optional i think you you give uh	Defending/Explanation
we could program that pretty easily.	Statement
well so how should we proceed on picking a tool?	About-task
and i i can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance.	Other Answers
so that each person's hearable.	Understanding Check
uh hopefully second week of september if i can ever get warren sack to answer my emails.	Floor Holder
close your eyes.	Action-directive
uh i mean it's	Statement
as long as you get the sequence.	Understanding Check
so tell me about it.	Action-directive
but not of reverberation.	Collaborative Completion
two fifty six?	Understanding Check
this they changed them.	Defending/Explanation
but actually i would say that's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and then operate on it and then delete it.	Offer
yeah the microphone isn't going to pass any d c.	Acknowledge-answer
so that it's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one.	Defending/Explanation
is wasn't that what she was doing before?	Defending/Explanation
actually let me uh dave isn't here to talk about it but let me just interject.	Action-directive
hopefully not very much.	Statement
that's what i was just thinking.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
what would be easier would be like pointers.	Offer
if you doubt don't do it.	Offer
yeah so these wouldn't be backed up the	Floor Grabber
it is some piece of part of it.	Statement
oh you're talking about the v a d net.	Acknowledge-answer
accessibility.	Collaborative Completion
because you include more of actual pause time into what you consider overlap speech.	Defending/Explanation
and language input for example is of course uh crucial you know also when you do the sort of deep understanding analysis that we envision.	Rising Tone
it was it was	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but i mean i guess we still haven't had a a ruling back on this.	Statement
was it read?	Yes-No-question
and that's probably why they mentioned it to me.	Defending/Explanation
voicing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh you might want to mention something that that you brought up.	Offer
and we did we did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle additive noise.	Statement
well in the new test actually that's not true.	Dispreferred Answers
uh yeah we formed a coalition actually.	Floor Grabber
yeah people can leave it blank if they	Accept
yeah okay okay.	Acknowledge-answer
and branch out branch out from there.	Statement
no i mean if you go to you know if you go to prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the charles bridge.	Statement
how how much uh delay was there on the l d a?	Rising Tone
um which is uh what we have also if use p l p and m s g together.	Floor Holder
i'm beginning to feel my heart beat now.	3rd-party-talk
oh but the thing is that we uh uh we had some things that uh	Floor Grabber
there's a some web page where they have a list of like ten of them or something.	Statement
basically we have to do recognitions for all three of those cases.	Understanding Check
because you're already left with a high standard deviation.	Defending/Explanation
oh i have.	Accept
and you're you're subtracting in the in the in the i guess it's power power domain.	Understanding Check
so you just you need to have the boundary at the start and the end.	Defending/Explanation
no the k l t.	Collaborative Completion
you mean like you know southern u s or northeastern or	Understanding Check
and you'd be able to look for the continuation.	Defending/Explanation
uh even that's hard enough.	Floor Holder
is that free?	Rising Tone
it's a good.	Accept
okay anyways sorry.	Floor Grabber
and then the meetings that they attended.	Statement
but you know uh let's assume somehow the processor power is going to be there.	Floor Grabber
if it's exhibiting itself it is a landmark.	Rising Tone
it was created from a synthesizer.	Statement
so what is the company?	Rising Tone
but but that's actually what i want to do.	Defending/Explanation
um can you repeat the question?	Rising Tone
i'm sorry i i got lost here.	Statement
but if we were asking the question which i thought we were of of of um how do we figure out what's the nature of the queries that people are going to want to ask of such a system knowing what's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking.	Defending/Explanation
i think you need to talk to waibel.	Offer
i just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were going to do at the front where we each said who we were.	About-task
i mean i find it very hard to reconstruct what's going on.	Defending/Explanation
so all tours a tour happens only within one day?	Declarative-Question
no it's because for all the for the adaptation and normalization steps you cannot	Defending/Explanation
uh and assume that that will that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of zoo castle whatever type things these bigger places.	Understanding Check
but um this this net performed quite well.	Statement
it can't be relied on only.	Collaborative Completion
um and so	Floor Holder
for the test.	Accept-part
no i mean it sound it sounds pretty reverberant.	Reject
so the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in english with the little apostrophe or whatever you call it.	Reformulate/Summarize
so it might be better to use a different keys or something.	Offer
so this is slightly uh more complicated.	Assessment/Appreciation
um object information.	Rising Tone
as long as you're not doing the processing on the downsampled.	Defending/Explanation
and in that case we'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such c p u's on your own in the java base format.	Offer
you know that's that's it.	Humorous Material
okay so this is the difference between the p.c. keyboard and the sun keyboard.	Acknowledge-answer
that you haven't come across you haven't invented features which are actually going to do badly for a a significantly different task particularly one with larger vocabulary.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then we have to be careful with that also with the neural net.	Action-directive
uh i think that's that's all we have this week.	Floor Holder
so you take a bathroom break in the middle and and keep your head	Declarative-Question
what happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else?	Wh-Question
some.	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so it'd be so in this case the probability that y equals a would be uh w one times	Statement
i think they're there pretty much all the time.	Statement
it's pure pure silence with the with the machine on the on the roof.	Dispreferred Answers
but i just wanted to double check with other people before i told them yeah no problem.	Defending/Explanation
how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure.	Statement
the deadline is in may.	Statement
yeah it's a lot faster.	Accept
and so i think that that often often you can't tell.	Statement
and yeah it seems to us that this way of just dropping the beginning and end is not	Statement
it was it was high.	Assessment/Appreciation
and so so your list here are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings?	Rising Tone
no we did the liz talk.	Reject
as you said to i mean we would like the idea to have it there.	Statement
because they want to know where it is.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah the one i i get all the time is tsk.	Floor Grabber
so um there are these digits.	Statement
somebody who's part of the meeting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right so that's that's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting.	Floor Grabber
no we have to help we have to decide.	Reject
more or less?	Declarative-Question
it wouldn't be for all meetings.	Defending/Explanation
yeah so that's so let's start with haas and yeah.	Action-directive
well you and and especially you did some some.	Floor Grabber
so it it was the best result i could get.	Floor Holder
so do you have that processed there then.	Understanding Check
and and i think you mentioned at some point that you wanted a little pad of time anyway.	Understanding Check
right true.	Acknowledge-answer
so it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things.	Statement
yeah right now i'm i'm focusing mainly on this final project i'm working on in jordan's class.	Floor Holder
so maybe the analogy isn't quite right.	Downplayer
but the problem with that is that isn't quite the same.	Statement
well the crown ones were like two fifty.	Statement
oh that is too much fun.	Assessment/Appreciation
right we only tested it on the the medium mismatch.	Floor Grabber
smoothing along frequency.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that kind of thing maybe uh at some point.	Statement
oh that's funny.	Assessment/Appreciation
when is your uh meeting?	Rising Tone
but i don't think it's something that happens in just everyday speech really.	Statement
could we put one more thing on here maybe?	Yes-No-question
and then we wouldn't have to worry about it.	Humorous Material
did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold?	Rising Tone
no only if you don't have lax vowels i guess.	Reject
in this case.	Expansions of y/n Answers
is that an action item?	Rising Tone
that's not a bad strategy.	Assessment/Appreciation
or the u.h.e.h.a.h. were all the same.	Statement
you're probably wondering why i brought you all here today.	Topic Change
that's that's the only optional thing.	Reformulate/Summarize
and uh it's function is to to uh essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires.	Floor Holder
well we're not doing we're not doing length.	Downplayer
we'll probably add it to the language model.	Statement
where you can use one or another spectral subtraction thing.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or another algorithm to to process uh the the segment between marks uh founded by the the the bic criterion and applied for for each frame.	Statement
that's a nice user interface dan.	Assessment/Appreciation
well i i did the only experiment where i tried was i used the channel zero vad for the noise estimation.	Defending/Explanation
i need a desk at home too all right?	Humorous Material
that you're saying uh what is your	Signal-non-understanding
is that what you're saying?	Declarative-Question
qualifier.	Statement
so meanwhile	Floor Grabber
but if we're in a hurry we can put that off.	Offer
well you know the the thing the thing about this is thinking kind of maybe a little more globally than i should here.	Floor Grabber
no the the these are the p files from broadcast news which are regeneratable regeneratable.	Reject
two hundred and twenty.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so yeah what we do is we compute the silence probability.	Rising Tone
although it seems like that's um a high burden on the note taker.	Assessment/Appreciation
because suddenly	Defending/Explanation
yeah then the mel filter bank.	Accept
um and again if the second pass is really really fast uh another one i've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff um going back and and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a a digit but uh which have very low energy.	Floor Holder
and people are just hysterical.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we could we could run run some kind of significance tests.	Offer
but but it might be uh in some ways it might be better to rather than giving the endpoints to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with.	Offer
no i understand it's better to do.	Statement
because it seemed like there was a difference.	Defending/Explanation
i think that's definitely the right way to do it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
or focus more on the targets and on the training data?	Declarative-Question
yeah because then you know exactly what's going on.	Floor Grabber
when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh significantly.	Rising Tone
also is stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to to think about uh voiced unvoiced	Topic Change
uh and though for us constructions are primarily semantic.	Floor Holder
actually it'd be a laugh.	Rising Tone
shouldn't it be qual t.i.c.k.l.e. or something?	Or-Question
that's that's non threatening and it's also an a good indicator.	Assessment/Appreciation
if they really have taken out enough of the of the uh uh work that that it's feasible then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year.	Offer
there can be frequency bins with negative values.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
but maybe we'll get some insight on that when when uh the gang gets back from crete.	Statement
so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology.	Statement
i'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question.	Offer
but by trying to do the best classifier you possibly can for these little phonetic categories	Defending/Explanation
i mean what's the	Wh-Question
so somebody will be playing the recognizer.	Statement
mccoond?	Understanding Check
um but i'm uh looking into extending the work done by larry saul and john allen and uh mazin rahim.	Floor Holder
reacting.	Collaborative Completion
is that not allowed with this project?	Understanding Check
and that's the whole point about the naming conventions.	Statement
and the um all pole filter that you get out of that should be good.	Rising Tone
so that's what really impressed me.	Statement
sure but other i thought though the node we're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action.	Accept-part
if they were pronouncing something in a certain way i could say oh well that's just the german way of pronouncing this.	Statement
so they're little neural neural units.	Statement
i'm sure i'm sure it's a t c l based thing.	Statement
um we don't want to update the mean and variance during long silence portions.	Floor Holder
because we can just go out and buy them.	Defending/Explanation
and i made it so that these are um with a couple exceptions but things that you wouldn't find in the spell checker.	Statement
we can can't you figure it out from the mike number?	Rising Tone
since i got back so recently from my vacation.	Defending/Explanation
you can do it i think.	Maybe
erase that part.	3rd-party-talk
we just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing.	Defending/Explanation
if if there's another part of the system that causes a latency of a hundred milliseconds is this an additive thing?	Rising Tone
oh yeah that's a good one.	Acknowledge-answer
uh today we're looking at a number of uh things we're trying.	Floor Holder
no it not um	Reject
role yeah.	Acknowledge-answer
the projector is much louder than the air conditioning.	Defending/Explanation
and i could tell because of the way it looks.	Statement
i mean if you are recording it through a mike.	Defending/Explanation
and i don't know why.	Other Answers
uh maybe you know we could by the end of the weekend we could have the top one.	Offer
oh yeah all of us are banging.	Humorous Material
oh i wanted to	Floor Holder
so that's what you'd have to do.	Action-directive
um and see if they're interesting.	Floor Holder
so we could perhaps do just mean normalization before v a d.	Offer
nein!	Reject
what what do they	Wh-Question
do you have a particular parser in mind?	Rising Tone
let's let's separate that out.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which uhhuh?	Collaborative Completion
but what a super tool.	Assessment/Appreciation
a user interface.	Statement
i'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little itsy bitsy tiny sounds in the middle of everything.	Rising Tone
forty forty four.	Acknowledge-answer
so i'm glad to know that's useful.	Floor Holder
and you got some response from from uh i b m about	Declarative-Question
and it's it's it's a little slightly simpler.	Defending/Explanation
grads and professors fine.	Statement
it's sort of like a prisoners' prisoners' dilemnas game where you know everyone's wearing their blindfold but someone could just cheat and look see what's see what's going on.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models whatever those models are to be munged you know.	Defending/Explanation
it's happening a lot.	Statement
m f c c features.	Statement
because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in in ours.	Defending/Explanation
um i i would say maybe two weeks.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
although i guess it's only ten minutes each.	Understanding Check
and that could be	Statement
but uh did you do you still uh get the mails?	Yes-No-question
so we have to figure out some uh uh uh basically display hack or something to do this.	Offer
yeah he seemed when i asked him if he could actually supply data he seemed a little bit more reluctant.	Acknowledge-answer
and so it's we we haven't thought it through.	Floor Holder
do you think it might help?	Rising Tone
oh absolutely you can do it.	Accept
i just went through the poster quickly.	Downplayer
well we could just turn out the lights.	Floor Grabber
eee yeah.	Accept
well in the home the influence of the home is much lower age than that.	Reject-part
but i just think that that uh for real noises what what's most likely to happen is that there'll be some things that are relatively stationary.	Negative Non-no Answers
because we've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them.	Defending/Explanation
but then when you go to type on your keyboard at home.	Collaborative Completion
apparently no.	Reject
all right but let me let let's stay with this a minute.	Action-directive
and get the locations which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual	Statement
well i mean we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on.	Statement
god!	Assessment/Appreciation
so how there'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are.	Floor Grabber
right so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a non speech event at the same time?	Acknowledge-answer
because it's the speakers the same.	Defending/Explanation
never i've never seen it at icsi.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and i don't know exactly who to ask.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what's wrong with yours?	Rising Tone
usual.	Understanding Check
initials.	Collaborative Completion
so when you said you were going to start that top one were you going to use the new segmentations?	Rising Tone
and it hurts uh a lot.	Assessment/Appreciation
some some harmonics	Statement
because it didn't matter if it was huh or um you know versus um.	Defending/Explanation
the other one is we just run his thing and send it to i b m.	Offer
and uh and and i guess actually uh after eurospeech for a little bit uh he'll go up there too.	Floor Holder
so so many tell you something about that.	Statement
yeah i don't know what's typical here.	Acknowledge-answer
yeah don't talk to yourself too much.	Action-directive
by speech do you mean speech by one by one person only?	Rising Tone
i have hari's.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah they're totally hidden.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
you start with the presegmentation.	Understanding Check
uh so you know that that bin would be marked as it as double dots.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so that it's a little more presentable and organized.	Defending/Explanation
and they seem to complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us.	Statement
um it seems that after spectral subtraction speech is more emerging now uh than than before.	Floor Holder
no no i mean if you	Reject
but it was smaller than ours.	Statement
does that the mean and variance have it be zero mean and unity variance.	Offer
have you thought about how long would be uh most useful for you to go up to o g i?	Rising Tone
if it was comfortable okay.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
two two to six percent.	Understanding Check
which gives you much better results.	Statement
well put well put.	Assessment/Appreciation
have they uh have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted uh on a per channel	Yes-No-question
up there at the top.	3rd-party-talk
which are being included in that.	Understanding Check
so and you know the the segmenter usually misses little things like uhhuh and yeah.	Floor Holder
intellectually it's interesting to work on things uh one way or the other.	Assessment/Appreciation
have a good voice detector	Offer
and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine.	Offer
and he did some fancier things.	Statement
but the crazy thing is we'd have to convert the we'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette to use it.	Floor Holder
given the constraints of this task we can't in a very nice way feed forward to the recognizer the information.	Statement
i mean that you know that like you said the fundamental thing is it doesn't have to be this hardware.	Defending/Explanation
so it's very very similar.	Statement
yeah it's kind of like you know the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them.	Accept
oh there's there's one other issue.	Floor Grabber
so you do a bunch of meetings.	Offer
you know they're trying to set up a a work bench or something or other.	Statement
dinner.	Collaborative Completion
um as you might imagine when you're dealing with um really a fair number of words and uh natural speech	Statement
uh you know those europeans.	Floor Grabber
and it's hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
well i think i think there's some misunderstanding here.	Statement
because he started like he would say certain words over and over.	Defending/Explanation
i mean all those issues yeah i'm sure we	Negative Non-no Answers
yeah i didn't.	Accept
this is painful task.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance actually.	Statement
kind of early on.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and like	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so that they should only write down the transcript if they're sure.	Offer
but i i just	Statement
uh this is italian mismatched.	Floor Holder
uh in fact we get it for free.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
and then there are various ones like um um ish decay instead of h.t.k.	Rising Tone
i mean as fast as talking to a person.	Expansions of y/n Answers
either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the english generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way.	Rising Tone
so they gave me a lot of feedback the labelers after doing this.	Assessment/Appreciation
oh right oh yeah.	Continuer
i mean you're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation.	Statement
yeah i wasn't making any statement about that.	Defending/Explanation
but that was speaker dependent actually.	Downplayer
and then we do it.	Statement
i don't know him.	Statement
so it's in parallel.	Statement
uh if the use the small v a d	Floor Holder
this is just it's just one subject.	Downplayer
well what you can see is that it's it's her lack of of english fluency that's being	Statement
the mixed channel is artificial.	Expansions of y/n Answers
like that you're flexible?	Understanding Check
my guess is it's going to be ten.	Negative Non-no Answers
because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech.	Defending/Explanation
and there is something more to this actually.	Statement
it uh came out just fine.	Assessment/Appreciation
you could say it's sort of built in.	Collaborative Completion
as many people here and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view.	Dispreferred Answers
i mean because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from o.g.i.	Defending/Explanation
ding ding ding ding.	Humorous Material
but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done?	Yes-No-question
yeah the the	Floor Grabber

dot berkeley dot e.d.u. of course.	Statement
whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it's not exponential anymore.	Statement
yeah cool.	Acknowledge-answer
so even	Statement
and i spoke with jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff.	Statement
they signed.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um so susan susan ervin tripp who you know um would typically and i've done this too supervise undergrads to do this kind of thing.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so um one thing is there's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now.	Floor Holder
and to breathe.	Collaborative Completion
now shorter words wouldn't would induce more dynamics.	Understanding Check
so at any rate so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we're going to do and then when we're going to do it.	Offer
trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on.	Defending/Explanation
this is just a little bit different.	Dispreferred Answers
so we want to we want to look at exactly those sorts of things.	Offer
yes certainly.	Accept
it struck me that um you know we could start out with some sort of general thing about um things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or uh dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type.	Offer
run dash command.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable?	Wh-Question
so far we haven't.	Statement
because everybody's scared.	Defending/Explanation
so it's multi english.	Rising Tone
and then later on we'll read it with pauses between.	Action-directive
subtext.	3rd-party-talk
uh yeah but this is the second configuration.	Acknowledge-answer
um so i'll put this over here.	Floor Holder
and so we try it out and see how it works.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i uh the stuff i did i combined pairs of these into stereo pairs.	Statement
it'd be interesting if we could do prediction.	Offer
there goes chuck.	Humorous Material
you know they'll say something first.	Defending/Explanation
i'm going back to o.g.i. today.	Defending/Explanation
okay yeah because this will be like after	Acknowledge-answer
four that you worked with?	Understanding Check
so although the email email will change i think that's a good way of doing it.	Rising Tone
in in this room?	Declarative-Question
yeah all we have for some people is digits.	Floor Grabber
uh maybe just uh quickly today about maybe you could just say a little bit about what you've been talking about with michael.	Offer
for the whole institute.	Collaborative Completion
well there is aligned spectral pairs is like the the	Statement
or on english only.	Statement
if you're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you'd like	Negative Non-no Answers
well anyway uh	Floor Holder
that's what it's for.	Statement
of of uh what things will be attacked.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and then uh in a bad meeting or some meetings where he said oh he's had some problems what does that mean.	Statement
but if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something i think it'd be prohibitive.	Statement
anybody have anything else?	Declarative-Question
and what are we talking about here?	Wh-Question
and then everything uses that buffer.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh but but you know that'll	Floor Holder
and listen to where i wanted it to stop.	Rising Tone
so wouldn't	Yes-No-question
and at some point they were saying it so much i didn't know how to transcribe it anymore.	Statement
he's doing some different things.	Statement
feedback.	Collaborative Completion
and then see how much better it gets.	Collaborative Completion
and you know and and maybe you could get to it by that.	Statement
so it would be good to just to summarize that.	Statement
it'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps versus	Offer
what what i would	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
if it should be the same c d rom that we distribute publically.	Understanding Check
with with uh connected digits.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which is more like a musical noise or something.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean the the filter that that estimates the mean has a time constant.	Defending/Explanation
i think we should also at the same time try to uh convert over to your new naming conventions.	Offer
because it's systematically encoded you know?	Defending/Explanation
this is crown.	Statement
his laptop where uh which we used for the smartkom data collection for the synthesis.	Rising Tone
i think professors probably want it.	Statement
so o n e.	Expansions of y/n Answers
we know exactly how much you have left in your cup.	Statement
right yeah yeah yeah.	Accept
because morgan said he asked you.	Defending/Explanation
what's it sound like?	Wh-Question
i don't know how you do it.	Other Answers
or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about semantically speaking uh	Or-Clause
um on	Floor Holder
we still have to do this too right?	Understanding Check
to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it's occurring in.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you mean the transcribers?	Understanding Check
until we get to the point where we're fairly comfortable with the hardware and the software and everything works.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but i know that in france for example parisian french is much easier for me to understand.	Expansions of y/n Answers
how many people would not vote for the sun keyboard?	Wh-Question
as related from the user model.	Collaborative Completion
it's a little bit confusing.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
oh i i uh	Acknowledge-answer
that's that's a good set of work that that uh	Assessment/Appreciation
couple days?	Rising Tone
maybe you weren't around when when when hynek and guenther and i	Rising Tone
so that's six six point	Statement
so i notice people going pfft you know if they're trying to say something is done.	Floor Holder
it's nice to actually measure it though.	Statement
uh i guess yeah.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
so if the if the if you change in both training and test the absolute level by a factor of two it will have no effect.	Defending/Explanation
uh the like all of them.	Rising Tone
so that's roughly the ratio then.	Understanding Check
no in smartkom terminology that's um called a function that's modeled by a function modeler.	Defending/Explanation
and then the darpa meeting i just excised completely.	Statement
and then call it external services.	Statement
they were said as letters.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so i mean to do it after the mel conversion uh after the noise removal after the mel conversion.	Floor Holder
and is the	Statement
but it means that you're going to get a bunch of different level levels of resolution in your survey it it'll be more of a pain later.	Reject-part
how about their birthday?	Rising Tone
with the s r i system.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but uh due to other reasons like some people are going away i'm i'm hoping it's not pushed off for a a long while.	Floor Holder
there's just no way you could get it all.	Statement
if if we're about to wind down i think what i would prefer is that we uh delay the anonymization thing till next week.	Offer
but six and eight.	Rising Tone
that's that's good yeah because the overall rate is	Accept
yeah i own the project.	Acknowledge-answer
well sample it.	Offer
um now would this involve some manner of uh monetary compensation?	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
that's all i found.	Statement
yeah i had one one short point.	Accept
same same acoustics.	Statement
probably should go.	Offer
the p.c. one?	Understanding Check
but they're uh they're really high.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah presumably.	Maybe
because if we completely ignore latency and then we discover that we really have to do something about it we're going to be find ourselves in a bind.	Defending/Explanation
you mean you	Understanding Check
when you're talking about your artificial meetings they are going to be goal directed though.	Understanding Check
yeah go ahead.	Action-directive
in order to find out how to get there.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because you have a lot more experience than i do.	Defending/Explanation
that was the other thing.	Statement
it takes an extra step.	Defending/Explanation
okay yeah just don't just need more more results there with that that.	Acknowledge-answer
the speech.	Collaborative Completion
yeah i i like the idea of having this in there.	Floor Holder
or even forward.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh two point six out of eighteen.	Self-talk
okay that's uh my question.	Acknowledge-answer
i'm sorry i'm i didn't follow that last thing.	Apology
loop it?	Offer
um about getting the data.	Floor Grabber
because mark you know mark's really into this.	Defending/Explanation
um it'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates.	Floor Holder
but the more things that we can get it for the more useful it will be for various applications.	Defending/Explanation
uh right i mean the multi english so far is is the best.	Floor Grabber
well and actually um it is true that with respect to laugh there's another one.	Statement
well let's should we finish this?	Offer
but this was the uh just just to review.	Statement
yeah that's a good question.	Floor Grabber
yeah i i think you can't get at all of it.	Floor Grabber
uh there is the first formant which is the larger.	Rising Tone
i mean there's other things involved.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but if if no one's told me things then i'm just proceeding from my my guesses and and uh and yeah i i'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean i'm just always asking jose what he's doing you know and and so it's there's uh there's obviously other things going on.	Apology
and uh so the initial thing which came from uh the meeting that we had down south was uh that um we'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one.	Floor Holder
yeah like uh not next week.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
if they occur to you.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that one that you have?	Understanding Check
it does it does muck up the data in in some funny ways.	Statement
can we sorry i mean is it known whether something's voiced here or is it roughly estimate estimateable?	Rising Tone
well the other thing that you know i mean the the alternative might be to	Statement
where it could go backwards without you having to go up and do it manually.	Rising Tone
and perhaps throw out	Offer
and apparently it helps a little bit also.	Rising Tone
so he actually he wrote me about it a little bit.	Floor Holder
is it a town square?	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean couldn't	Yes-No-question
although i bet we could program it once.	Offer
then there is of course more ways of parsing things.	Statement
you don't have to go through handwriting recognition.	Defending/Explanation
you know it's quite tempting to use some kind of uh software thing.	Statement
i'm just saying fluency.	Defending/Explanation
things are slower there.	Assessment/Appreciation
and and if someone becomes more interested we could work our way up.	Offer
where you just basically ignore everything outside of the uh region that was deemed to be foreground speech.	Statement
that was that was the most excitement i had all weekend.	Assessment/Appreciation
yeah i usually have it set to where it has um point five second intervals on the numbers.	Floor Grabber
but that's this afternoon's meeting.	Statement
because i don't think that it's	Defending/Explanation
uh thursday morning should be fine.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
hey look what we found.	Humorous Material
because it doesn't like the un segmented data.	Defending/Explanation
i mean is that the right way to do it?	Rising Tone
i still think we should try a a meeting or two with the blindfolds.	Offer
they're not huge huge though.	Negative Non-no Answers
because what you do is you can you know build it into some sort of a	Offer
if there's already a job running on some machine that you're trying to select your job will get queued up.	Statement
uh but yeah.	Continuer
so it's important to have the colon here.	Statement
which is a perfectly flat spectrum.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no we can throw in an out of film construction if you want to.	Reject
but i could try to look into like this uh c v s over the web.	Offer
uh up to eleven.	Floor Holder
because on on whatever it is they're trying because it's a lot of work even just with the h t k.	Defending/Explanation
and they were all doing it at the same time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so we have a v a d which is like that's a neural net.	Negative Non-no Answers
and and so i guess what i don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative.	Other Answers
so then i end up clicking on the arrow they have the arrow at the far right.	Rising Tone
so the idea is going to be to do	Offer
and i'm think of of just having us integrate that in.	Statement
i'm not.	Dispreferred Answers
pick one.	Defending/Explanation
i'm going to take a look at the uh backchannels.	Commit
i've heard the swearword version.	Statement
and it will give you his i.d.	Expansions of y/n Answers
something like that right?	Understanding Check
well if they made output.	Floor Grabber
and then um people do this in image processing some.	Rising Tone
right uhhuh.	Continuer
yep mhh.	Continuer
i i don't remember.	Defending/Explanation
and i sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form.	Statement
but um hhh those that i have found that way to me i think the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation.	Floor Holder
yeah you guys talked about doing a videotape.	Floor Grabber
that it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down speech researcher or or something at that granularity.	Defending/Explanation
and and you'll you'll have to do it sychronously.	Statement
the user can always say it but it's just sort of we we hand over these parameters if we make if we have a feeling that they are important.	Statement
this is with just fifteen frames.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's well the it it's it's true that it also it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases sure.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so basically we will i think we'll try to to focus on these three architectures.	Commit
and jane and i will look at it.	Commit
i can do earlier in the day on thursday or um most of the time on friday.	Offer
but maybe not counting the non native speech.	Offer
well maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we've already done	Offer
or windowed?	Declarative-Question
that that right that that um	Floor Holder
they are very similar techniques.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
which fifty do i do?	Rhetorical-Question
i'm not sure exactly what the gist of what he was saying.	Downplayer
because they're really big.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh or or magnitude domain.	Floor Holder
yu-ching.	Correct-misspeaking
which is which?	Rising Tone
that is i i really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today.	Statement
uh i think that may be due to the fact that adam ran out of digits uh and didn't have time to regenerate any.	Defending/Explanation
so i end up	Statement
is it the same set as the alignments?	Yes-No-question
i noticed you c c'ed me but i wasn't actually a recipient.	Statement
but i think they're since they're here they can talk about it themselves.	Action-directive
and whether you're going to put it in the text where he says hey roger or are we going to put that person's anonymized name in instead?	Or-Question
so then just email you?	Understanding Check
so i mean you're still going to	Statement
well then you have to do the web site.	Statement
that's not a problem i i guess.	Assessment/Appreciation
no i'm talking about with the adaptation.	Reject
that was programmed for yesterday i guess.	Expansions of y/n Answers
they're they're starting to work on some kind of multi band.	Rising Tone
um so we're actually	Floor Grabber
so this is just combination at the utterance level.	Understanding Check
they have five is kind of	Statement
when we did this tweaking of the self loop	Rising Tone
put them on a web page.	Offer
you have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer to ground truth very easily.	Defending/Explanation
that information.	Rising Tone
did it	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i mean i'm sure about that.	Statement
oh that was good.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh we should do a measurement in here.	Floor Holder
if this voicing bit doesn't help uh i think we don't have to to work more about this.	Rising Tone
which could have one drawback if there is uh a backchannel in between those three things.	Rising Tone
no but the thing is the fact that she's she's did it before just might give a lower bound.	Floor Grabber
well then there's the other issue is that to to add more disk now um david says we really need to go to new servers.	Statement
and i have some short research issues.	Statement
i mean were you thinking uh that it would be useful for some research later to know say you said undergrad for instance so undergrad versus grad?	Declarative-Question
for a hundred meetings.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you probably do add things in those places where it's where nothing is transcribed really because they didn't even hear it.	Statement
does that pretty much cover everything we talked about?	Yes-No-question
and there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking.	Defending/Explanation
at least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords.	Statement
and maybe maybe i had resolution set differently.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean they're not used as probabilities.	Rising Tone
again i	Statement
i i can insert that.	Commit
because they're very high-level.	Defending/Explanation
that'd be nice to have a a uniform procedure.	Offer
and clearly.	Collaborative Completion
actually it's it's it's not bad.	Assessment/Appreciation
when you added the online normalization and so forth uh uh things got better again?	Rising Tone
right no no.	Acknowledge-answer
i don't want to because	Defending/Explanation
the andrea mike?	Understanding Check
how is that?	Rising Tone
okay my my focus was to try and maintain content continuity and uh to keep it within what he was saying.	Acknowledge-answer
so this is on how many words?	Declarative-Question
so what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there's something that they think that the pre segmenter thought there should be transcribed in there.	Statement
oh no it actually made it like point one percent better or something actually.	Reject
which they do in terms of having a a nice broad set of speakers doing the same thing meeting after meeting after meeting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
what about the the phrasing that um chuck used uh which was in in relation to the question i was trying to formulate of uh where where did you what	Wh-Question
uh maybe we could call someone else up who has.	Offer
so action action here means uh speech uh you know dialogue act.	Understanding Check
or or are we done?	Or-Clause
i mean that would be the most sensitive measure.	Assessment/Appreciation
but nancy isn't going to talk about that.	Rising Tone
uh you mean	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
i guess in	Statement
are the patterns like are they based on anything or	Open-Question
but uh i mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements.	Floor Holder
i'll go check.	Commit
but but they were not uh processed through a neural net.	Expansions of y/n Answers
think of it as what?	Signal-non-understanding
neither does thursday morning?	Declarative-Question
eighty eight.	Statement
so the only possibilities from sony are that one and the lapel mike.	Statement
i mean i don't know.	Floor Holder
and so again that's completely correct.	Floor Holder
well how many hours of training	Floor Holder
um and and you know i sort of threw in what you did with what jane did on in under the uh uh preliminary analysis of overlaps.	Floor Holder
yeah i'm sure you've seen her.	Acknowledge-answer
right so fine go on.	Acknowledge-answer
can you project it pretty well?	Rising Tone
you know you know	Floor Holder
i notice that they they they have some help with control of what person to pick up.	Statement
how many of these do you have?	Wh-Question
yeah so i think i will maybe train like gender dependent models.	Acknowledge-answer
um that we at least decided on.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so if there's any suggestions you have for that i was just going to send him the	Commit
so is morgan is the plan to just pick one of the far field mikes?	Yes-No-question
instead of region now say it's a little bit unbounded.	Offer
but you know that that might be the challenging part.	Floor Holder
if it varies a lot to get if if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech.	Statement
yeah that's originally we should thank jane.	Accept
i think you have to be in move mode before	Negative Non-no Answers
do i mean do you want do you want this do you need training data or adaptation data out of this?	Yes-No-question
so what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and	Offer
but when you when you listen to it	Statement
and oh that's interesting.	Assessment/Appreciation
oh this room.	Acknowledge-answer
but when you're going through the meeting and what i'd like people to do if if you're not uh uh is to go through the meeting	Statement
but it's unlikely that they would be.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's right with all the interrupts.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so that's going to stay that person's name.	Statement
they're not recording all fifty of the array.	Dispreferred Answers
which ones are those?	Wh-Question
oh i actually have some foot pedals for the p c.	Floor Grabber
visit my friends and spend some time	Defending/Explanation
and come up with some game plans.	Offer
put the computer on tour.	Offer
or is are they sort of competing techniques?	Or-Clause
that's that's what the feeling is like.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it's like the p d a thing.	Statement
imagine that you're reading a number phone number to someone.	Action-directive
not after i eight though.	Humorous Material
that they're they were unpopular.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you're trying to find the right system in some sense whether you're trying by categories or or parameters um and your goal is discrimination then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to um unsupervised nearness of things um is actually better.	Floor Holder
and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal.	Offer
so i could run this on those breathy channels.	Offer
i could say a few words about um some of the uh compute stuff that's happening around here.	Offer
people at u.w. want to look at it.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i would say we you do only males.	Accept
what gives the m l p alone?	Rising Tone
i mean unless you have really	Defending/Explanation
so all i'm saying is that the l p c twelve puts in synthesis.	Reformulate/Summarize
we we was thinking to do before after v a d.	Statement
now in terms of like so i i did some results which i'll report on next time which do mention individual speakers by name.	Floor Holder
and then it found actually the way to the entrance.	Statement
but were you saying that	Understanding Check
in at	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
isn't it catalan?	Yes-No-question
they so right now the channel numbers are discontiguous.	Statement
so we do need to add that one?	Understanding Check
like the front end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well but that but that as i said that that that works great for the acoustics but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse.	Accept-part
on the on on the bunch of uh fifty frames right?	Expansions of y/n Answers
and i was curious to to figure out when that happened.	Statement
they were like oh do we want to do this at the same time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh i mean we uh we don't need to require it.	Downplayer
they work on the code book excitation.	Mimic Other
so they're vocalization	Self-talk
so uh welcome back.	Floor Grabber
and how does it change the meaning?	Wh-Question
actually actually actually	Floor Grabber
all the native speakers.	Expansions of y/n Answers
the box is an inch thick.	Statement
anything on your end you want to talk about?	Rising Tone
uh not parse not	Misspeak Self-Correction
and we should decide how we're going to how we're going to handle some of these factors.	Offer
but this is a good discussion.	Assessment/Appreciation
like each node given its parents.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well we didn't.	Statement
because we do we do uh uh mel filter bank for instance.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i guess that's the point is is all the morphology and stuff.	Floor Grabber
and then we'll then we'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff.	About-task
i tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter.	Statement
and that might not be optimal.	Dispreferred Answers
and and uh oftentimes the fuh is like knocked out of the spectrum by	Statement
yeah but again you could argue that that's exactly what the neural network does.	Floor Grabber
and then combine them with their feature stream.	Statement
well we could start computing another huge table.	Accept-part
because if somebody else thought something was interesting i'd kind of want to know about it.	Defending/Explanation
the prosody?	Declarative-Question
um i usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they're laughs.	Floor Holder
also interestingly the um the difference actually widens.	Assessment/Appreciation
i prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related.	Statement
and then we downsample yep.	Collaborative Completion
oh just just ending with so.	Acknowledge-answer
the red wire!	Exclamation
or giving permission?	Declarative-Question
without having to know ahead of time which is which.	Offer
like um like you would say the apple.	Expansions of y/n Answers
with the what file?	Signal-non-understanding
and people uh i have to be conscious of that sometimes.	Statement
let's plan next monday okay to have a review of what we have so far.	Action-directive
so i prefer it to be a little bit tighter.	Statement
no it was one like one ribbon for everybody.	Accept
and um i think that there is ultimately a really good uh potential for you know bringing in things with different temporal properties.	Floor Holder
because not everybody talks.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
uh the first thing i tried to optimize is the um time constant of the smoothing.	Statement
uh i mean manage the jobs and so forth.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i won't do it.	Statement
the the you know the word to and the word going to and to go to	Statement
so you then you have the meeting context.	Defending/Explanation
yeah you know i i sort of got started using the recognizer just recently.	Floor Grabber
and so so here we're thinking well let's see if the meeting goes another hour it's going to be another thousand dollars.	Statement
no not default.	Reject
it's like the zapruder film.	Humorous Material
it's a it's a month and and a week.	Dispreferred Answers
uh uh uh no.	Reject
and maybe also because the level of fluency for the spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the german speakers that are here.	Defending/Explanation
yeah because at forty i mean you could you could have	Floor Grabber
now we're at a pilot phase right now.	Statement
it's three point four.	Rising Tone
anybody in the in this group doing anything for eurospeech?	Rising Tone
all right i'll find out from you.	Commit
what is it again?	Self-talk
you mean uh to combining the the posteriors on full band recognition like from from three different or four different mikes.	Understanding Check
so it's not like that's being done in one place or one time.	Understanding Check
which is slightly tricky.	Assessment/Appreciation
i have the there're various things like breathe versus breath versus inhale and hhh.	Statement
so um did we have	Floor Holder
okay it just it just seemed to me that uh that this isn't the ideal type of separation.	Floor Grabber
yeah we can try something.	Commit
oh i don't get that one.	Floor Grabber
i mean then we'll go we'll go nuts.	Statement
everyone more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription.	Defending/Explanation
and then we could also put in what's on the board.	Statement
if it's if it's if it's silence or or unvoiced regions then you you you don't really want that in there uh if you can help it.	Offer
now so are we talking about the stage of uh simply the word stage?	Rising Tone
because the the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions.	Defending/Explanation
no i don't have for each.	Reject
i really do.	Statement
we all had the same thought.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
how about optional but highly desirable?	Wh-Question
wasn't that a kick?	Yes-No-question
and you basically build up to the twelve seconds.	Statement
i i think i find them very comfortable.	Assessment/Appreciation
but um yeah that's quite you know we've that's been done.	Floor Holder
error rate ratio.	Misspeak Self-Correction
wasn't a formant synthesizer was it?	Understanding Check
i'm not sure how how to build that in.	Other Answers
but sometimes it's hard.	Defending/Explanation
so if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that's fifty percent.	Understanding Check
so i just to make sure i understand this so in this case um we would still compute the average?	Understanding Check
but something like	Statement
okay mate mark up framework.	Floor Grabber
i think i think it was um something like four seconds and um six seconds and eight seconds.	Repeat
in that case it's people saying things like one one one dash so-and-so.	Statement
i think i think you can put optional.	Offer
well that was just one of the reasons.	Accept-part
it just says that it's a bell curve and that you have something that has a nice range in your sampling.	Defending/Explanation
i mean not only can you do microphone arrays but you can do all sorts of um multi band as well.	Offer
so you can you can be really make it as cheap as possible or you can say i want uh you know i don't care.	Statement
uh because when when we look at the l d a filters well they are basically low pass.	Defending/Explanation
or something from someone else.	Offer
without wanting to go there.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah it's perhaps then it's perhaps five percent of something.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb the sound.	Offer
i'm making a distinction.	Defending/Explanation
i didn't either.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah it's it's good to	Floor Grabber
you have the other thing that that they know why we're doing it.	Statement
i'm sorry!	Exclamation
that's really cruel.	Assessment/Appreciation
technically	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
i mean you say not clear yet.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which will take a really long time to run.	Statement
there's two sheets of paper in front of us.	About-task
that's that's nice.	Assessment/Appreciation
not this	Dispreferred Answers
yeah that's really hard.	Floor Grabber
so that's why it's coming to us as new.	Statement
yes okay okay.	Acknowledge-answer
throughout the meeting.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so i guess the other thing is to take you know if one were to take uh you know a couple of the most successful of these.	Offer
a dendrogram tree.	Mimic Other
leave to japan the day the disk crashes.	Statement
well maybe maybe not.	Maybe
uh one way one really brain uh brain dead way of of of not causing any trouble but saving disk space is to uh use the the sphere the nist uh w encode program to to encode you know to compress them.	Offer
we we sort of didn't get that far.	Defending/Explanation
and the way i would transcribe it i would put that so that would be hard comma so.	Statement
that's all	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
you can say one or the other?	Understanding Check
okay you guys are more in business that i am.	Acknowledge-answer
how about these meetings when where there are like eight speakers in one meeting?	Rhetorical-Question
and i have like uh uh two more things i wanted to say.	About-task
oh it's in the paper.	Acknowledge-answer
well but you know we have to try.	Action-directive
which is what the literature is sort of like now.	Expansions of y/n Answers
um and then if i summarize somebody can tell me if i'm wrong.	Floor Holder
so let's finish with the speaker form speaker form and then we'll get over get over to that one.	Action-directive
um that way if we make a mistake parsing or something we don't see the point five.	Defending/Explanation
so who who does this summarization?	Rising Tone
so that they'll show up really easily.	Defending/Explanation
uh uh so	Floor Holder
and there is all this work on transcription.	Floor Holder
so he's like he tries to capture only the stationary part in it.	Statement
it's working.	Assessment/Appreciation
which one is the andrea mike?	Wh-Question
just what would you like to know.	Offer
you see all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before.	Defending/Explanation
right we	Floor Grabber
i have a auto gain mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal.	Defending/Explanation
you could email to both of us uh just i mean if you wanted to.	Offer
i mean it's difficult because you want it to be real speech right?	Understanding Check
i'm going to go download transcriber.	Commit
it's nice to have a core set of data though.	Statement
which would be useful when it comes back to us.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh he will be in washington though.	Negative Non-no Answers
okay so now who would've	Floor Grabber
how how long are how long chunks are they?	Rising Tone
so maybe if you echoed something to the you know dev dev console or something.	Offer
with the different time constant i found that	Statement
sometimes there are some some words are cut off.	Statement
well test them also on finnish.	Statement
no yeah yeah.	Accept
i'll i'll i'll suggest that to the charer.	Commit
one was that spectrogram that we show is okay.	Assessment/Appreciation
what i what i would say is um if it's communicative beyond just the mouth opening and the oh you know the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak then i would like to have it if it's communicative i'd like to have it preserved.	Offer
not for our meetings.	Dispreferred Answers
oh it's seventy five per cent!	Exclamation
you have you have these foot pedals but you you're not using them.	Understanding Check
i think we just we just have to listen to it and see how good they are.	Offer
liz had sent them a note saying could we please have another i don't know three days or something.	Defending/Explanation
the part down there where there's the maximum number of of um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to to to code stress uh sentence stress as possible indication of uh information retrieval.	Statement
you do this kind of piece wise linear or uh some kind of piece wise approximation.	Statement
yeah they would.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run um you'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were going to use run command uh to only have ten of those going at a time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh that's neat.	Assessment/Appreciation
um to do training and test and so on.	Floor Holder
and it felt to uh the users that it was instantaneous.	Statement
dave	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
so which can cause you to lose time.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no and their web their web page didn't answer it either.	Floor Grabber
i'm not against the idea of a summary.	Defending/Explanation
oh it doesn't look so bad.	Statement
so are are you familiar with this the the marsec project?	Rising Tone
and so we're we decided early on that we were not going to do that.	Defending/Explanation
is it i mean the h t k models are diagonal covariances.	Statement
i it's not really probably not worth doing.	Assessment/Appreciation
until you get crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit.	Expansions of y/n Answers
right and you just they're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits.	Accept
pre crashed.	Acknowledge-answer
i don't want to stop working for dave.	Dispreferred Answers
the one you're talking	Statement
no what you need to do is you'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall.	Floor Grabber
uh well working on the v.a.d. is still still important i think.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean so we're going to get more disk space?	Declarative-Question
or or maybe not even a second.	Offer
and uh the other task probably is also you know challenging the the the querying uh the command control or you know i mean doing that in natural language.	Defending/Explanation
for beep.	Collaborative Completion
or maybe six.	Offer
i don't know if it would be useful for comparison.	Other Answers
but uh what is the the the relation of uh of the performance when uh you use uh the uh uh speech the p d a speech files?	Wh-Question
so uh from these results we have some questions with answers.	Floor Grabber
and little worse on the on the m m case.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well anyway sounds like there'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days.	Floor Grabber
yeah it's much easier.	Accept
from multiple people.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i i don't know whether it was system one or system two.	Understanding Check
and none of them did.	Statement
like we were talking about so.	Rising Tone
several microphones?	Declarative-Question
now what was this thing that	Wh-Question
now i mean you know it's true.	Statement
me too me too me too.	Collaborative Completion
but uh people could like listen to them a little bit and generate some queries.	Offer
into	Expansions of y/n Answers
in other words the beginning of something could be one speaker.	Defending/Explanation
why do you think the icsi front end is so much worse?	Wh-Question
uh but it's another thing to try.	Floor Holder
and it's picking up all of morgan's words pretty well.	Statement
i mean you have to really think you know about what you're saying	Defending/Explanation
get your paper off my p.d. a!	Action-directive
uh and i already i already said what i was doing.	Floor Grabber
are we okay?	Yes-No-question
i didn't get that from him actually.	Dispreferred Answers
or you just tested on this?	Or-Clause
and and it doesn't really hurt.	Statement
okay so the one one thing i knew i wanted to talk about was about uh sort of last minute stuff to uh try to get some recognition results.	Rising Tone
so on	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but if you knew that what you were going to do is detect sonorants or not	Statement
if we can do anything with it yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
fancy-schmancy.	Expansions of y/n Answers
to fill in i see.	Collaborative Completion
well actually shorten	Dispreferred Answers
but the silence probability from this network seems uh better.	Defending/Explanation
how much is it just to buy the mike?	Rising Tone
another table.	Collaborative Completion
um uh which depending on what's going on like i'll do that.	Floor Holder
if every root that's	Statement
um and that's to average out you know pitch you know the pitch contours and things like that.	Floor Holder
that was very suspenseful.	Assessment/Appreciation
then we can make a user state.	Rising Tone
yeah it's like a speed	Accept
uh uh yeah.	Floor Holder
and and when i when i'm totally in doubt if there's a case where it really could be either and i could flip a coin i'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense.	Statement
but that again was speaker dependent with lots of feature selection.	Statement
all the different test sets.	Mimic Other
i'll use the mouse.	Rising Tone
that's different than format.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah uhhuh yeah right.	Accept
and there didn't seem to be any uh penalty for that?	Understanding Check
words aren't bad yeah.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so well that's	Floor Holder
yeah i guess we can do a little better than that.	Floor Holder
so i have a bunch of scripts with x. waves and some perl scripts and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are.	Defending/Explanation
uh why?	Wh-Question
that's just not right man.	Humorous Material
and and that's not communicative.	Statement
people will put it i i	Statement
yeah i understand.	Accept
but it's it's the same item.	Statement
it's it's not against his conclusion.	Defending/Explanation
so it's it's clean speech basically.	Rising Tone
yes but not the reverse.	Accept
okay well let's let's see what we can get.	Offer
i want to ask one question though.	Statement
a lot of these are are coming from them.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you won't be able to segment.	Defending/Explanation
p.z.m.'s cost a lot.	Statement
because if if you go much larger you have a you know your your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less um precise.	Defending/Explanation
we can try networks with log rasta filtered features.	Offer
and just sort of stuff like that.	Rising Tone
um uh when you're talking about combining multiple features	Floor Holder
so yeah i i guess it's just a question is that something you want to spend your time on.	Floor Grabber
people interested in the speaker separation.	Expansions of y/n Answers
which is you know exactly the problem we have	Statement
what about proficiency in english as well?	Rising Tone
yeah down here.	Acknowledge-answer
i've heard the	Statement
uh attributes like how much memory the machine has.	Floor Holder
but they have a verification.	Defending/Explanation
um there are cases where you'll get a segment and it's someone else's utterance.	Floor Holder
i i don't mean uh you know.	Other Answers
and where if he has any filters which are derived on o g i stories added with some type of noise which what we are using currently.	Expansions of y/n Answers
that's the the flaw of the experiment.	Downplayer
got it compiled and everything.	Statement
that you're going to you're going to do transcriptions?	Understanding Check
and that we can actually infer them to a significant degree or we ask.	Statement
it's called the route planner or something.	Statement
and it there's a sort of also a split if you if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said.	Rising Tone
did you did uh did you find a place?	Rising Tone
so i mean is it is it is this is it like something you've done before?	Yes-No-question
if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened it'd be it'd be fine.	Expansions of y/n Answers
or want to get up and leave.	Negative Non-no Answers
why don't we do them together this time?	Offer
what am i?	Wh-Question
because you can't enforce any minimum level of specificity.	Defending/Explanation
it doesn't work for finnish and spanish.	Statement
but um in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping is the near field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap?	Or-Question
that somebody's already done.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you know it's it's it's not no big surprises.	Defending/Explanation
let me rephrase that.	Action-directive
since then you'll have just more digit data.	Defending/Explanation
let's see have you one of the things that i found is is um surprisingly difficult these days is to is to get certain electronic sounds to try and describe them?	Self-talk
but but my my guess would be that it's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find.	Statement
bunch of stuff for	Acknowledge-answer
that's that's a nice fast way to do it.	Defending/Explanation
well i want to leave the marked	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
i don't have feedback from him.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but no you're absolutely right.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it's not hard.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh well yeah.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
p.c. and two thousand dollars for the a. to d. stuff.	Expansions of y/n Answers
a meeting meeting meeting.	Acknowledge-answer
but i've carefully covered it so that it doesn't	Expansions of y/n Answers
you wouldn't have that difference also that you have in the say in switchboard data.	Statement
boy the recognition on what you just mumbled is going to be really horrible.	Statement
well that's me personally.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
or will we run into trouble when we	Understanding Check
you know you can you can comment these results also.	Offer
the second is using features and k l t transformed m l p outputs.	Rising Tone
so that was number that was the second set of uh the second section.	Statement
but worse you know environmental conditions.	Expansions of y/n Answers
because for instance you can imagine uh uh if you remember from from uh from your your quals john ohala saying that uh buh and puh differed uh not really because of voicing but because of aspiration?	Declarative-Question
uh so we have to redo the uh the experiment training the net with uh p l p but with delta.	Statement
i don't mean that you model it.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
we'll i mean we'll we'll be telling them that the reason we're trying to do this is is to generate queries in the future.	Expansions of y/n Answers
you you can i mean you could you could you could run the	Offer
you mean the the mean is computed based on some frames in the future also?	Understanding Check
i didn't i didn't understand that.	Defending/Explanation
but it varies a lot.	Expansions of y/n Answers
uh it's it's potentially audible you could potentially recover it.	Statement
with the noise estimation was based on first ten frames.	Statement
um having gone through this process and trying many different things i would imagine that certain things uh come up that you are curious about.	Statement
what about um the way people treat when they give a joke?	Wh-Question
you're you're b?	Understanding Check
i still like my rug on the wall idea so if anybody patents that then	Humorous Material
is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control?	Rising Tone
and then do it again at the boundaries.	Offer
well yeah exactly.	Accept
it is possible.	Maybe
go to that.	Action-directive
you can degrade it further by using those things.	Defending/Explanation
can i can i just mention something?	Rising Tone
was it steve?	Rising Tone
if if if if someone says uh what what is jose doing and then jose says something you need to know that that was jose responding.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and so you can mess with this one.	Defending/Explanation
so the only agenda items were jane was jane wanted to talk about some of the i b m transcription process.	About-task
and uh it might be if someone's interested in it uh certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term.	Offer
ooh!	Exclamation
well i guess i guess we can we can say that it will help.	Assessment/Appreciation
so this this is mode here means the same as endpoint.	Statement
because um i suspect that would be uh pretty time intensive.	Defending/Explanation
just out of curiosity what was the bug?	Wh-Question
oh yes we have like a system that gives sixty two percent improvement.	Statement
i mean which are extracted at the handset.	Statement
how in the world are they going to ever distribute this?	Wh-Question
which i guess makes makes sense.	Statement
that's a t c l audio thing that i had some involvement with.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well i mean it just depends on how much disk space is a problem.	Accept-part
i'm glad to hear that.	Assessment/Appreciation
so they have released their uh document describing the system.	Rising Tone
no they're i think there is this silence in addition to the um k l t outputs.	Reject
you won't be able to get funding.	Defending/Explanation
and um the preliminary results were very bad.	Rising Tone
and then do your normalization based on that.	Offer
uh yeah okay.	Continuer
we were thinking something like you know ten hours to begin with.	Statement
so that's new upper limit?	Understanding Check
but their but their format if you wanted to indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route then they a window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers.	Understanding Check
just to be totally clear.	Statement
well in answer to is it landay's problem.	About-task
no on the on the darpa project who would be sort of contacts for mari.	Reject
i went back and hand marked the the bins.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
so actually i received a a new document describing this.	Statement
but if if it doesn't work out i think we would rather charge ahead with the older segmentations.	Offer
uh aware of what's going on.	Expansions of y/n Answers
were his uh windows centered around the	Rising Tone
and i don't know exactly how they recorded it.	Other Answers
and then voiced sound are more high frequencies.	Rising Tone
but not very significantly.	Expansions of y/n Answers
v a d.	Rising Tone
um the georgia tech classroom two thousand is a good one.	Offer
what about normalizing also?	Rising Tone
so we'll have to grab this over c v s or something?	Declarative-Question
but you'd cut down substantially on the overlaps.	Offer
i i print them out as i need them.	Defending/Explanation
anyway but i can certainly try the s r i front end without uh v t l.	Statement
you got plenty of data.	Defending/Explanation
just to just to try it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh it's like line	Acknowledge-answer
answer	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
but it was just a thought that that it might be something to try.	Defending/Explanation
uh lots of pronunciations of of the same thing are going to give you better data than you know a few pronunciations of lots more things.	Statement
someone has to track that down.	Action-directive
wasn't there	Yes-No-question
and the transcriber interface is fine if essentially what you're doing is stringing words together to to make transcripts.	Assessment/Appreciation
u penn.	Acknowledge-answer
the wireless ones.	Statement
for the public one.	Collaborative Completion
like a eurospeech paper.	Expansions of y/n Answers
somewhere in between the start and the end of the foreground.	Understanding Check
oh yeah i i understand.	Accept
a list that you have to send off to who?	Declarative-Question
because it's it's just not relevant to the to the meeting and or to conversational speech anyway.	Defending/Explanation
so as long as we're not using any testing data from	Offer
yeah yeah that's no problem.	Accept
oh that was the other thing.	Floor Grabber
shortening everything on the fly.	Collaborative Completion
which isn't uh very time-consuming.	Expansions of y/n Answers
just just in terms of	Defending/Explanation
if somebody was paying really close attention you might get	Statement
and then hesitation.	Humorous Material
have you heard listen to the first two or	Rising Tone
so i mean you could that's why i was thinking in a section like that you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say oh yeah.	Statement
unless they changed the rules.	Expansions of y/n Answers
it you wouldn't even have to have the audio.	Statement
it's kind of even more disorganized now.	Assessment/Appreciation
i mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i mean what i thought what i would have thought in is that when there were a large number of overlaps it was because everyone was talking at once but uh apparently not.	Statement
yeah i've never looked over the t.i. digits corpus.	Acknowledge-answer
but how do how would you how would you freeze that information about what uh	Wh-Question
and anyway we're going to have to find some way to uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible.	Action-directive
oh can i ask also?	Rising Tone
because i guess voice activity detection on this should could be worse.	Defending/Explanation
so that was that topic.	Topic Change
and you create a tree.	Collaborative Completion
but i would i would i would thought think that what we would want to do is not futz with this stuff for a while.	Offer
yeah that's i think that's fine.	Accept
that's complicated.	Assessment/Appreciation
and um so dave has something which uh is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects.	Floor Holder
and by the way	Floor Grabber
maybe we should have a big meeting meeting.	Offer
last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff?	Understanding Check
read it	Rising Tone
sometime it's a little bit better.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that?	Rising Tone
but i bet it's a good superset of it.	Defending/Explanation
or or or is it?	Tag-Question
because uh because it depends on uh what our goal is.	Defending/Explanation
i know the numbers that were used.	Humorous Material
yeah so even if you're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there's some non voiced regions at least you can have these islands of reliability where you're pretty sure.	Floor Grabber
the question is what is what's he looked at.	Statement
uh mainly because of uh when you you plug the um frame dropping in the baseline system it will improve a lot h.m. and m.m.	Defending/Explanation
and so if we can get away with just doing three we can do many more experiments more quickly.	Defending/Explanation
i think it would just be fun you know if nothing else you know.	Assessment/Appreciation
well i mean that would be tremendously useful information.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i uh that's i think that's completely right.	Assessment/Appreciation
then we need to figure out what influences its choices.	Statement
so the smoothing is i did a smoothing actually on this gain uh trajectory.	Rising Tone
another thing would be to have to to pick two two plausible things.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and it kind of helps to balance the load of the machines.	Statement
oh that's fascinating.	Assessment/Appreciation
well it's not that so much as that you know with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt.	Dispreferred Answers
yeah so this is not really the viterbi alignment.	Floor Holder
i don't see why why your signal is louder after processing .	Other Answers
i will by next week though.	Commit
and how do you envision um the the um this deep semantic to be worked with?	Wh-Question
no but no but	Floor Grabber
but i want to double check.	Defending/Explanation
no syntactic analysis.	Rising Tone
um i could go check.	Hold Before Answer/Agreement
well okay so what happened with switchboard was at least i mean the output was that they had speaker turns.	Floor Grabber
i can't really hhh tsk i don't have really representative numbers i think.	Other Answers
it could.	Accept-part
especially when they're when you were using the the mikes that weren't headmounted mikes.	Rising Tone
it's could be.	Maybe
or okay.	Acknowledge-answer
those look pretty good.	Assessment/Appreciation
uh training	Floor Holder
it's just one snapshot.	Defending/Explanation
it's just i'm sort of in this uh area i don't know much about.	Defending/Explanation
well um these are all people off campus from campus so far.	Understanding Check
the x. well the k.s. or whatever at the end.	Statement
because this is accuracy.	Defending/Explanation
what have i forgotten about?	Rhetorical-Question
and other people need to do that for themselves uh or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal.	Action-directive
maybe we could just like talk into a cup.	Offer
and what's the what so what has the data been?	Wh-Question
but i haven't seen it yet.	Statement
and that i think it would pick up the micro structure the	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
that's true they do they do say that men's voices carry better.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
because no one grouped them together.	Defending/Explanation
so that i can do it.	Defending/Explanation
so should um one question i had for you was um we need we probably should move the aurora and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk.	Offer
the other way i had it which might work is you put one over an ear.	Offer
which is for someone else.	Statement
yeah we we we already missed the party.	Statement
is that the log?	Yes-No-question
and um it wouldn't surprise me if they did something like that with this.	Floor Holder
yeah it's okay.	Assessment/Appreciation
it's probably more than a day.	Statement
a lot of companies i've worked for the uh the person leading the meeting the executive or whatever would sort of go around the room and and mentally calculate how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing.	Statement
okay so if the this	Statement
yeah that's like	Accept
uh yeah i usually visit zoos or i usually visit castles or i usually	Statement
especially with a really long eee like that.	Defending/Explanation
which i don't really understand the function of.	Expansions of y/n Answers
well i can actually do it too there.	Offer
to work	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
you know between them or something.	Expansions of y/n Answers
but for software it's probably better for it to be silence.	Offer
and it isn't it isn't that	Collaborative Completion
but you're saying that by the time you call it back in to from their saved format it opens up a window window with five speakers?	Understanding Check
transcript status from jane.	About-task
like read.	Collaborative Completion
i think this also ties into one of the things that jane is going to talk about too.	Statement
and then again starting at sixteen.	Statement
actually that's the transcription conventions i was talking about this with jane it's really important to people at least like me who want to know um certain uh who are looking at aspects that are sort of they're not words but they're structural things you're trying to recognize.	Defending/Explanation
to to decide what to do.	Collaborative Completion
change it to laugh.	Offer
but i'm not sure if that will be useful.	Other Answers
i've only was there ten years ago for a day so i don't remember but	Defending/Explanation
but we need to try different things.	Statement
because i don't understand what they're talking about.	Defending/Explanation
i wonder if that would have a a contributing factor.	Statement
yeah it's it's significantly worse well but uhhuh.	Statement
do you remember	Yes-No-question
okay now can i can i say the other aspect of this from my perspective.	Offer
of of us at least in the beginning is going to have a number of different characteristics.	Statement
what we can get from the utterance.	Statement
that's uh versus uh?	Understanding Check
i'm sure we'll find out soon.	Statement
we just have a labeling with word models.	Statement
i mean the reason was like in t.i. digits i don't have a lot.	Defending/Explanation
a video yeah.	Accept
what if you did l p c twenty?	Offer
well my my impression	Statement
i'm not sure these are great ideas.	Downplayer
because they they make l d a.	Defending/Explanation
well i cannot you cannot hear	Defending/Explanation
they're switching their mikes off or something?	Understanding Check
or at least make sure that the note taker takes a you know a snapshot of the board.	Offer
uh michael is doing that.	Understanding Check
uh it's the v.a.d. plus the baseline actually.	Floor Holder
the mixed signals uh.	Misspeak Self-Correction
you you folks have been looking at this more than me.	Downplayer
nice falling.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
yeah .yeah.	Accept
um of recording.	Floor Holder
why don't you say five-thirty?	Offer
but if you had the data and we had a a company.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
go there or not i think is a good one.	Assessment/Appreciation
nist headers.	Acknowledge-answer
well if if you have a good estimation of the noise.	Dispreferred Answers
i i will i will uh talk about uh in the in the blackboard about the my ideas.	Commit
and um and it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon.	Floor Holder
and do you have a clear i mean is that	Yes-No-question
so we wanted to certainly distinguish american versus british and other types at that level.	Rising Tone
and then shortened.	Repeat
the the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet.	Defending/Explanation
so it's messier.	Understanding Check
no the d c component could be negligible.	Floor Grabber
but you think we'll be able to retrieve the other hour reasonably?	Understanding Check
yeah i mean uh that's part of the problem is is that what we really need is somebody else to come along.	Acknowledge-answer
costs?	Rising Tone
do you?	Tag-Question
um the too many things to can go wrong and you lack control.	Floor Holder
so what's the if you ignore	Statement
can i ask a i mean a sort of top level question?	Rising Tone
so we actually found that the vad is very like crucial.	Statement
so the next point.	Floor Grabber
make that up to the go there then.	Action-directive
because on the uh handset they just applied this wiener filter and then compute cepstral features.	Understanding Check
if your if your subtraction's going to result in a negative number you you don't do subtraction in that.	Understanding Check
well then you should try them a few weeks later.	Offer
is that always true?	Yes-No-question
well there is the avendano work.	Rising Tone
why don't we read some digits?	Action-directive
i mean uh	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable
given given uh uh not transverse the castle the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just	Or-Clause

um pilot data put together and sent to i b m for transcription.	Floor Holder
that's something that's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum.	Rising Tone
so the relevance of the speaker form here	Understanding Check

as long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional if there are a lot of other optional things on the form.	Action-directive

if you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse then if you can categorize what it is that you're looking for with reference to those those larger headings then you can find it.	Statement
are you do they have a bunch of options like uh	Yes-No-question
i think those are interesting.	Statement

let	Interrupted/Abandoned/Uninterpretable

i mean of course there is a lot more work to do with this one.	Statement
i mean there's still this issue of of of how much time	Or-Question

maybe we could include it in this in this set of uh this stuff we send.	Offer

like i i i guess we're trying to limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go.	Statement
you know if you normalize but you look everywhere at at at fricatives or something you won't really know anything.	Defending/Explanation
because yeah if the the resolution if it's moving too slowly then like if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused.	Accept

but what about for for these issues of summarization a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone.	Statement
you'd have to find where the digits were.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so my suggestion is we just pick uh	Offer
we can start we you can make a hundred of them or something.	Offer

is he gone now?	Rising Tone
um preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed.	Floor Holder
just from word choice.	Collaborative Completion
and all the speech pauses.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so you want to do the exact same thing.	Offer
i'm supposed to do it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
yeah that's all.	Topic Change
no it's more that that if you felt something wasn't gaussian and you were trying to .normalize for some kind of uh bias of some sort you might use a non parametric measure.	Offer
so what what happens is that when we apply online normalization we jump to almost ninety per cent.	Rising Tone
i know it's weird.	Defending/Explanation
uh and if it's a low energy portion you might actually hear some funny things.	Floor Holder
and and in in the in the previous version where in the which is used now there the backchannel would would be in between there somewhere.	Expansions of y/n Answers
and yeah i mean that it	Floor Holder
actually well also i i can say i made barriers for so that the stuff i was doing with collin which just used um this kind of foam board.	Floor Grabber
this is limiting the choices but yeah.	Reformulate/Summarize
yeah and if not i can re train those models very quickly.	Floor Grabber
are they doing some nice integer multiple?	Rising Tone
and he was	Statement
we've got volume.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

but i imagine you could um uh predict a uh um a label uh from more in the past than in than than in the future.	Offer
but it should be okay.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i'm not sure how they would do it when they're working with the digits.	Other Answers

well he he made a claim.	Negative Non-no Answers
well is there is there is there a nist routine which can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices?	Rising Tone
that's my recollection of all of our meetings together.	Statement
oh i'm thinking i don't know about the acoustics.	Defending/Explanation
oh this is accuracy!	Acknowledge-answer
in fact we had visitors here who did that.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers

sort of the opposite of that would be if if you find out you're going to get a negative number you don't do the subtraction for that bin.	Statement
i'd like to have many different speakers.	Offer
what just approximately what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever?	Wh-Question
i think that's what the i have here.	Maybe

assuming that we actually pursue it.	Expansions of y/n Answers
no not levels of interest.	Dispreferred Answers
i i i will include too the the the differential derivates too.	Commit
roger maybe in charge of.	Statement
we're not we're not recording the empty channels.	Statement
oh it's really a kick.	Assessment/Appreciation
um so we might want to change it over to something a little more standard.	Floor Holder
but what i what i was thinking uh the reason that i didn't want to make it completely open ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common.	Defending/Explanation
which is mostly trying to give advice to dave when he he he actually does the real work on this uh reverberation thing.	Statement
well we don't have to do digits.	Dispreferred Answers
can i borrow a piece of paper?	3rd-party-talk
thursdays?	Signal-non-understanding
and um so this is just setting them to be	Floor Grabber
of breath or of uh nothing?	Understanding Check
just just to be consistent from here on in at least that that we'll do it at the end.	Action-directive
which will also be possibly helpful.	Expansions of y/n Answers
so the ones i've been thinking of are all sort of uh power responsibility.	Rising Tone
and then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed.	Defending/Explanation
the time we start digits?	Understanding Check
okay these have no parents yet but i guess that sort of doesn't matter.	Statement
right it's something you're not interacting with.	Floor Grabber
k uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do do our digits do our digits duty.	Action-directive
yeah dan added that in.	Floor Grabber
what would you suggest as a as a change?	Wh-Question
and now this one	Statement
so the e d u meetings that thilo has now presegmented all of them for us on a channel by channel basis.	Expansions of y/n Answers
whatever you're interested in.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
um so there's this noise suppression thing which is sort of worked out.	Floor Holder
should we close the door?	Rising Tone
because there's a similar project at s r i where we're using we want to do something like that to look at whether or not some of the stylized pitch stuff is um sort of perceptually similar to the kinds of things that people would mark.	Defending/Explanation
because it's not really interesting.	Defending/Explanation
yeah i'm rather used to it now though.	Floor Grabber
so then i was um talking to morgan about some new proposed work in this area sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where i was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns.	Floor Holder
okay so let's start with the uh belief nets the general influence stuff.	Action-directive
and we're talking about doing how many hours worth of meetings?	Declarative-Question
i mean if you look at the theory it's it should be in the power domain.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
this is very important.	Humorous Material
there were problems even with um english speakers though.	Statement

sometimes it's hard to tell.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
i trail off with so.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
and we'll run a train a neural net.	Collaborative Completion
but then we also have these mikes is the other thing i was thinking.	Offer
just like oh that's interesting.	Expansions of y/n Answers
oh so these are particularly for time alignment?	Understanding Check
that would be a new overlap.	Statement
you know it really is like a placeholder of some sort.	Defending/Explanation
we could sit down and think of sort of the the ideal speaker utterances.	Offer
because then you have you know more and more chances to get away from random errors.	Defending/Explanation
so if you just take p l p with uh the double deltas.	Statement
tells the person how to go.	Rising Tone
yeah fans.	Affirmative Non-yes Answers
it i'm sure sometimes on purpose.	Accept-part
for t i digits.	Understanding Check

horrible?	Collaborative Completion
okay enough on forms.	About-task
okay the idea is that you have then um you have ground truth.	Acknowledge-answer
i huh i don't remember which ones.	Rising Tone
well anyway you don't have to decide this second but think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it i'll.	Floor Holder

because what what they take is sort of this this fixed representation of a of an intention.	Statement
so you overestimate the noise spectrum.	Statement
for the p d a's?	Declarative-Question
or do we just quit?	Understanding Check
is it applied all the way back here?	Rising Tone
but it's that you get enough of the high frequencies.	3rd-party-talk

did it do pretty well?	Rising Tone
and what's he interested in specifically?	Rising Tone
p l p features computed on noisy speech.	Expansions of y/n Answers
i should also say i did a simplifying uh count in that if a was speaking b overlapped with a and then a came back again and overlapped with b again.	Statement
um another i was thinking of was um taking some spectral slices.	Offer
