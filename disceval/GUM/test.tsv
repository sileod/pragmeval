the prevalence of discrimination across racial groups in contemporary america :	results from a nationally representative sample of adults	elaboration
mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace	by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members . [ 12 ]	elaboration
even so , estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare	( see [ 13 – 14 ] ) .	evidence
at least one prior study by kessler and colleagues [ 15 ] , however , using measures of perceived discrimination in a large american sample , reported that approximately 33 % of respondents reported some form of discrimination	( see also , gibbons et al. [ 4 ] ) .	evidence
the current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large , nationally representative sample of adults from the united states .	additionally , the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences .	elaboration
""" what do you think was the main reason for these experiences ? """	all respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically , those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question :	preparation
for the present analysis , these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories	capturing the following options :	result
the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing ( legitimate skip ) .	additionally , because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences ,	cause
we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the wave 1 interview .	because a race variable is not available from the wave 4 interviews ,	cause
but not all would have been interviewed at wave 3	due to differential patterns of temporary attrition .	cause
two additional demographic variables are included .	to provide information on the analytical sample as a whole ,	purpose

agents can rationally choose between experts	only if the criteria that distinguish genuine experts from charlatans are common sense or widely known :	condition
they must know what kinds of knowledge they must utilize	to guide their selection of sources	purpose
to mimic the markers of expertise is to mimic expertise [ 17 ] .	since expertise must be assessed through indirect markers ,	justify
we live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a means of inflating their pretense to expertise .	this fact , together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur , reduces ordinary people 's trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources .	result
taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions	to ensure that people are taken in .	purpose
for example , a small number of doctors set up the american college of pediatricians ( acpeds )	to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care .	purpose
but it has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum	by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large .	cause
many people mistook the organization 's political beliefs for the consensus view among united states pediatricians —	although the peak body for pediatric workers , the american academy of pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] .	antithesis
it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization .	insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise ,	condition
it introduces an epistemic pollutant .	when acpeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession ,	circumstance
a yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals	in the interest of promoting the companies ' commercial products [ 23 ] .	purpose
the companies hoped to leverage the prestige of elsevier with these fake journals	"to endow their promotional "" research "" with an air of reliability ."	purpose
but rather the legitimacy of elsevier 's publications — and , by extension , all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research .	the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by elsevier ,	antithesis
for example , the frontiers contingent of journals appears legitimate — at least to me —	despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee . 8	concession
yet some frontiers journals appear to have engaged in bad behavior ,	whether for profit or for some other motive .	purpose
jeffrey beall decided to add the publisher to his influential ( but now sadly unavailable ) list of questionable journals [ 26 ] .	whether due to this behavior or not ,	cause
one can not reasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments .	if academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate ,	justify
one can hardly blame them .	if their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution ,	condition
it is incumbent on me to note that i have published in frontiers journals on several occasions .	since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise ,	justify
these institutions do not exist	solely to credential experts .	purpose
and these functions may come into conflict ,	creating pressures to inflate credentials .	result
and many cases of such manipulation exist —	take the recent example by the university of malaysia , which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [ 28 ] .	evidence
and they may try to keep their discoveries in-house	to protect their reputations .	purpose
in fact , many , if not all , the markers of expertise identified by philosophers enjoy widespread recognition .	but rather the legitimacy of elsevier 's publications — and , by extension , all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research .	no_relation

we hypothesized that the children , who were over the age of six at the time of collection , would have adult-like si interpretations .	we expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments , and would result in adult-like interpretations .	elaboration
this study is limited in its power and generalizability .	it serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of si in particular and acquisition more generally .	evaluation
bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough	despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people using them .	concession
future studies need to include more participants and more items	to increase power .	purpose
future studies should also include a larger age range of children	to document the age at which adult-like performance emerges .	purpose
in the current study , the responses from two children were not included	because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items .	cause
this is unlikely	as they said that even the first training item was said well .	evidence
"and that "" yes "" was in some ways a default answer to be provided"	when having to respond verbally in a test context .	circumstance
the cardinal numbers included in this study were only one through five	in order to avoid additional item variability ,	purpose
these results provide valuable insight into si interpretation by chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research , but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .	albeit limited ,	concession
we expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments , and would result in adult-like interpretations .	significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some .	no_relation

digital humanities clinics -	leading dutch librarians into dh	elaboration
in 2015 , an initiative was started to set up a dutch speaking dh+lib community in the netherlands and belgium ,	based on the example of the american communal space of librarians , archivists , lis graduate students , and information specialists	elaboration
in essence , we want to teach our country 's librarians the ins and outs of dh	in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in dh projects .	purpose
the aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in dh , for a diverse group of librarians , consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills .	the content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work .	purpose
and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development	by engaging with the dh community .	elaboration
we follow a four step approach with a working out loud - principle ( williams , 2010 ) :	in order to design this curriculum	purpose
get feedback from researchers on possible subjects ,	based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need ;	elaboration
get feedback from librarians on possible subjects ,	based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills .	elaboration

replication in second language research :	narrative and systematic reviews and recommendations for the field	elaboration
replication studies serve to test the reliability of the previous study 's findings .	when using the same materials and procedures as a previous study ,	condition
they serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions .	when altering specific methodological or participant characteristics of a previous study ,	condition
one indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language ( l2 ) research alone	( see references for 50 calls and commentaries in appendix s1 in the supporting information online ) :	evidence
these concerns speak to the very core of science ,	raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work .	elaboration
and these perceptions are thought to have caused , at least in part ( directly or indirectly ) , alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies .	however , a perceived lack of prestige , excitement , and originality of replication plagues l2 research ( porte , 2012 ) , as it does other disciplines ( berez-kroeker et al. , 2017 ; branco , cohen , vossen , ide , & calzolari , 2017 ; chambers , 2017 ; schmidt , 2009 ) ,	cause
however , a systematic metascience on replication research has not yet been established in the field of l2 research ,	leaving a poor understanding of the actual number and nature of replication studies that have been published .	result
the narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology , given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in l2 research , and also from education , another key sister discipline .	the narrative review is organized around four broad themes : (a) the quantity of replication research , (b) the nature of replication research , (c) the relationship between initial and replication studies , and (d) the interpretation and extent of reproducibility of the findings of initial studies .	elaboration
the systematic review provides a synthesis of l2 studies in journal articles that self-labeled as replications .	to gain insight into these issues in the context of l2 research ,	purpose
