aesthetic appreciation and spanish art :	insights from eye-tracking	elaboration
the viewing experience of art is a complex one ,	involving issues of perception , attention , memory , decision-making , affect , and emotion .	elaboration
focusing on a unique collection of 17th century zurbarán paintings .	the jacob cycle at auckland castle is the only uk example of a continental collection preserved in situ in purpose-built surroundings .	elaboration
no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes .	while studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics ,	concession
the purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks .	we will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice .	elaboration
the project brings together established research strengths in spanish art history , experimental psychology , digital humanities , and museum studies	to explore , using eye-tracking techniques , aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole .	purpose
a viewer gathers information through a series fixations , interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades .	when regarding an artwork ,	circumstance
the direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene ( e.g. colour , texture , brightness etc ) .	importantly , studying eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants ' beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork .	evaluation
previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts	( see for example brieber 2014 ; binderman et al. , 2005 )	evidence
zurbarán 's cycle of jacob and his sons has been on display in the long room at auckland castle for over 250 years .	it is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the uk , and one of very few of its kind in the world .	elaboration
but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood .	it has a long history in scholarship ( baron & beresford 2014 ) ,	concession
in this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive spanish art collections of county durham , of which the 13 zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 zurbarán artworks , the 13th benjamin , is a copy by arthur pond ) are a key part of ,	to investigate the ways in which audiences look at spanish art , how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways .	purpose

as an example , research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ]	by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers .	cause
for many scientific fields , however , there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty ,	making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis .	result
most fields , on the other hand , including computer science , lack a single all-encompassing organization	and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments .	elaboration
past studies have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [ 8 – 11 ] , usually specific to a particular field [ 12 – 16 ] , and often focused on the scientific elite [ 17 , 18 ] .	because assembling such a full census is difficult ,	cause
such samples are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability .	although useful ,	concession
in some fields , yearly data on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate .	in computer science , the computing research association ( cra ) documents trends in the employment of phd recipients through the annual taulbee survey of computing departments in north america ( cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey ) .	elaboration
for example , differences in recruitment and retention strategies across departments will be washed out by averaging ,	thereby masking any insights into the efficacy of individual strategies and policies .	result
the system is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours	using off-the-shelf computing hardware ,	elaboration
by assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone ,	this system will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields	result
this system can also be used longitudinally	to study how the workforce 's composition changes over time ,	purpose
and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses	"to investigate the "" leaky pipeline "" problem in faculty retention ."	purpose
and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments .	in short , many important research questions will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently-recollected census data .	no_relation
most fields , on the other hand , including computer science , lack a single all-encompassing organization	such surveys can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses .	no_relation

aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 olympics ( from new freeways to light rail systems ) , the city 's historic center underwent serious renovation .	most notable among the city 's facelift projects are the unification of archaeological sites - which connects the city 's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical thissio and pláka districts .	elaboration

on most sunny days the skies are azure blue .	whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads ,	concession
the main reason attributed for the pollution of athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave .	the government 's ban on diesel vehicles within athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin .	solutionhood
