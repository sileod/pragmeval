of interest here , studies suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring l2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] â€“ [ 15 ] .	however , it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels .	evaluation
in fact , substantial periods ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following l2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] .	such a scenario may be found in different situations , including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [ 19 ] .	evidence
( note that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on l2s acquired by children ;	for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) .	solutionhood
across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .	the training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years , and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels ( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] ) prior to the period of limited exposure .	elaboration
some studies suggest that it then appears to level off ,	with no further losses occurring [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .	restatement
finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for l2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] .	it remains unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to l2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] .	concession
such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] ,	introduction	no_relation

one of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb .	the use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage .	justify
and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary .	unfortunately , most of the time , people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency	cause
in addition to the harmful effects of mercury is that it emits ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation .	this uv radiation interacts with the chemicals on the inside of the bulb to generate light .	background
the proponents conducted a study about innovating and recycling cfl into a more efficient and environment friendly led light bulb .	since the cfls are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to led in terms of design and materials ,	cause
based on the results of the 2011 household energy consumption survey ( hecs ) ,	using cfls will allow people to decrease their energy consumption ;	no_relation
